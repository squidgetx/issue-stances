But listen to us. One side pretends to believe that racial discrimination, no matter how rampant and flagrant it used to be, is now ended. Oh, maybe there's a bigot or two in the woodpile, but discrimination as a matter for governmental concern is a thing of the past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other side pretends to believe that only racists who oppose minority progress could be against <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Discrimination a thing of the past indeed! A black man in America still hasn't got a chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each side knows (but feels no urge to acknowledge) that there is at least some justice to the other's position. The blatant segregation and discrimination are largely over. Law now forbids such racism, and -- I really do believe -- public opinion won't countenance it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But racial fairness (in some instances, in some arenas) still eludes us. Corporate management and directorships, legal and accountancy partnerships, and even concern for the plight of our children clearly are not distributed on the sole basis of deservedness. Race matters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truth is complicated and inconsistent and hard to figure out. Instead of undertaking the effort to figure it out, we draw the lines as starkly as we can and force the public to choose one incomplete reality (ours, we hope) and reject the other side's partial truth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It happens not just in our race relations but throughout our politics. It even happens in our courts, as when the clever Barry Scheck deliberately cut out any middle-gray consideration in the trial of Louise Woodward, the British au pair. Force the jury to choose between the cold-blooded murder of an innocent child and innocence (or at least reasonable doubt), he thought, and surely there won't be a conviction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His now-famous miscalculation (he was in court this week trying to reinstate the grays) might serve as a lesson to us all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it might show us the wisdom of changing the terms of the debate. Much of what I'm saying, I admit, is based on my belief that most Americans want to be fair and want our important institutions to reflect that fairness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't believe there are significant, politically influential segments of the society that are happy over the fact that African American admissions at Boalt Hall, the University of California-Berkeley's law school, are down 80 percent as a direct result of Proposition 209's ban on racial preference, or that the first-year class has but a single black member. I don't believe there are large pockets of secret jubilation that a similar trend is in evidence at the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, though, I doubt that many <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> supporters -- including the beleaguered Bill Lee -- want to parcel out society's goodies on the basis of racial entitlement. Many of us may defend, but few of us are thrilled by, voting districts drawn purely on the basis of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We want (is this hopelessly naive?) the same thing: a society in which gifts and grit and character matter more than pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what are we fighting about? Mainly, I think, about how to produce such a society. Some of us believe that the best way to achieve a colorblind future is to practice colorblindness now. And some of us believe that colorblindness after centuries of racism will merely lock in white advantage -- that we need to level the playing field before insisting on a single set of rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I remember when black quarterbacks were a rarity in the National Football League -- when the most talented collegiate passers were, if they were black, switched to defensive back or running back or some such. Then a couple of coaches broke the mold -- <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>? -- and then a couple more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the six starting quarterbacks (out of 30 NFL teams) constitute parity? Wrong question. What is true is that there is, at last, reason for young black athletes to believe they can go as far, at any position, as their talent takes them. As Gene Washington, a black front office executive with the league, told a reporter:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""What's most interesting to me is that I don't notice it. That's a good sign.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's a very good sign.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes
62926b2bba027005e0a84475	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1987023512.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Heartbeat of Racism Is Denial</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When our reality is too ugly, we deny reality. It is too painful to look at. Reality is too hard to accept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mental health experts routinely say that denial is among the most common defense mechanisms. Denial is how the person defends his superior sense of self, her racially unequal society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Denial is how America defends itself as superior to “shithole countries” in Africa and elsewhere, as President Trump reportedly described them in a White House meeting last week, although he has since, well, denied that. It’s also how America defends itself as superior to those “developing countries” in Africa, to quote how liberal opponents of Mr. Trump might often describe them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump appears to be unifying America — unifying Americans in their denial. The more racist Mr. Trump sounds, the more Trump country denies his racism, and the more his opponents look away from their own racism to brand Trump country as racist. Through it all, America remains a unified country of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reckoning of Mr. Trump’s racism must become the reckoning of American racism. Because the American creed of denial — “I’m not a racist” — knows no political parties, no ideologies, no colors, no regions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, affirmed that Mr. Trump did use the term “shithole” during a White House meeting on immigration with lawmakers. Mr. Durbin rightfully described Mr. Trump’s words as “hate-filled, vile and racist,” and added, “I cannot believe that in the history of the White House in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Trump is no exception. In framing Mr. Trump’s racism as exceptional, in seeking to highlight the depth of the president’s cruelty, Mr. Durbin, a reliably liberal senator, showed the depth of denial of American racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Begin with the eight presidents who held slaves while in the Oval Office. Then consider how Abraham Lincoln urged black people to leave the United States. “Even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race,” Lincoln told five black guests at the White House in 1862. So “it is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raging then as we are raging now, the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison responded, “Can anything be more puerile, absurd, illogical, impertinent, untimely?” He added that “had it not been for the cupidity of their white enslavers, not one of their race would now be found upon this continent.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Presidential history also includes the social Darwinism of Theodore Roosevelt, the federal-government-segregating, “Birth of a Nation”-praising Woodrow Wilson — and the bigotry that came from the mouths of presidents who are generally seen as essential to racial progress. President Lyndon B. Johnson said “nigger” nearly as often as Ku Klux Klansmen did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism. Where there is suffering from racist policies, there are denials that those policies are racist. The beat of denial sounds the same across time and space.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up to the beat of racist denial in Queens, not far from where Mr. Trump grew up. I was raised in the urban “hell” of neighborhoods he probably avoided, alongside immigrants from countries he derided last week. In school or elsewhere, we all heard recitals of the American ideal of equality, especially on the day we celebrate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Those events often feature recitals of the words “all men are created equal,” which were written by a slaveholder who once declared that black people “are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thomas Jefferson was not a founding father of equality. He was a founding father of the heartbeat of denial that lives through both Mr. Trump’s denials and the assertion that his racial views are abnormal for America and its presidents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fifty years ago, Richard Nixon transformed this historic heartbeat of denial into an intoxicating political philosophy. His presidential candidacy appealed to George Wallace-type segregationists while also attracting Americans who refused to live near “dangerous” black residents, obstructed the desegregation of schools, resisted <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies, framed black mothers on welfare as undeserving, called the black family pathological and denigrated black culture — all those racists who refused to believe they were racist in 1968.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nixon designed his campaign, one of his advisers explained, to allow a potential supporter to “avoid admitting to himself that he was attracted by” the “racist appeal.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new vocabulary emerged, allowing users to evade admissions of racism. It still holds fast after all these years. The vocabulary list includes these: law and order. War on drugs. Model minority. Reverse discrimination. Race-neutral. Welfare queen. Handout. Tough on crime. Personal responsibility. Black-on-black crime. Achievement gap. No excuses. Race card. Colorblind. Post-racial. Illegal immigrant. Obamacare. War on Cops. Blue Lives Matter. All Lives Matter. Entitlements. Voter fraud. Economic anxiety.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The denials using these phrases come from both conservatives and white liberals who think people of color are stuck in cycles of unstable families and criminal cultures, and that the deprivations of poverty and discrimination spin out bad people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump opened his candidacy with racism, calling Mexicans criminals and rapists. Since taking office, he has looked away from the disaster zone in Puerto Rico, he has called some violent white supremacists “very fine people,” and he has described Nigerians as living in “huts .”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When someone identifies the obvious, Mr. Trump resounds the beat of denial as he did before he was president: “I’m the least racist person that you’ve ever met ,” that “you’ve ever seen ,” that “you’ve ever encountered .”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are ugly denials. But it’s the denials from those who stand in strong opposition to this president that are more frustrating to me: denials that their attacks on identity politics are racist. Denials that the paltry number of people of color in elite spaces marks racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those denials echo the same ones that frustrated Dr. King in 1963 as he sat in a Birmingham jail cell and wrote , “Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, I suspect, will go to his grave with his heart beating in denial of the ill will of racism. Many others will as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because we naturally want to look away from our ugliness. We paint over racist reality to make a beautiful delusion of self, of society. We defend this beautiful self and society from our racist reality with the weapons of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Denial is fueled by the stigma associated with being a racist. Feeding the stigma is how “racist” is considered almost like an identity, a brand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a racist is not who a person is. A racist is what a person is, what a person is saying, what a person is doing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Racist is not a fixed category like “not racist,” which is steeped denial. Only racists say they are not racist. Only the racist lives by the heartbeat of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The antiracist lives by the opposite heartbeat, one that rarely and irregularly sounds in America — the heartbeat of confession.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/opinion/sunday/heartbeat-of-racism-denial.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: IBRAM X.

62926b2bba027005e0a84475	aa_opeds_sample/txt/398955309.xml.txt	"<div><p>Cross Country: A Tale of Two Daleys</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chicago -- Power, like yogurt and celebrity, is generally thought to have an expiration date. Not always, not everywhere -- and not, apparently, here in Chicago, where one family, the Daleys, has controlled the political action from City Hall for going on four decades. Richard J. Daley, or Daley pere, was mayor of the city from 1955 to 1976, and died in office; Richard M. Daley, or Daley fils, began his run in 1989, and it begins to look as if I, who am five years his elder, am quite likely to die while he is still in office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From time to time a local politician makes a noise suggesting that he would like to make a run at the Daley dynasty, as by now it must be reckoned. Most recently, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., who does a fair impression of a serious politician -- unlike his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who does a very poor imitation of Martin Luther King Jr. -- has criticized Daley fils for yet another of the small- and large-bore scandals -- this one having to do with <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> contracts -- that are as indispensable to Chicago politics as nitrogen to plant life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Jackson is on record as saying, ""I am concerned about the reports of rampant corruption and fraud and abuse in the city. I'm interested in our city restoring honesty and integrity in our government."" (Pause here for chortle followed by yawn.) He also insists that he has no intention of opposing Daley fils in his run for his sixth term as mayor in 2007, though he wouldn't rule it out. (Pause here for raised left eyebrow followed by cynical smile.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet whoever might run against him in 2007 -- even if candidates were to include a combined reincarnation of Winston Churchill, Gandhi, Disraeli, and the Archangel Michael -- Daley fils will be, as they say in Vegas, a prohibitive favorite. To be sure, he has done some very high-handed things in office; the most impressive of all in this line was plowing up Meigs Field, the city's small downtown lakeshore airport the survival of which everyone else thought was still up for discussion, and doing it, as the mystery writers like to say, by dark of night. But most Chicagoans don't seem to hold any of it against him. Hey, the kid's OK.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corruption, like sexual satisfaction, is relative. Corruption under Daley pere was widespread and wide open. Everything that passed through City Hall was for sale: health and building inspectors, cops, judges, even in one notorious instance -- the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon presidential election -- the White House. (I first heard the motto ""Vote early, vote often"" during this election, where it was more a modus operandi than a mere motto.) Some people see corruption as intrinsic to, if not inherent in, big-city government, and I'm afraid that I happen to be one of them, but then I'm an American, like the man said, Chicago-born.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one has ever accused the Daleys, father or son, of being thieves. Their interest has never been in money -- only in what money can do to smooth the way to power, which for them has always been the real point and prize of politics. Critics of Rich Daley -- the father was known as Dick, a harder name for a more obdurate man -- say that politics in Chicago under him is business as usual. I don't believe this is quite so, but in any case if corruption has gone on during his administrations, he at least has provided real compensations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chicago was once a city distinguished by having not one but two skid rows: one on south State Street, the other on west Madison. Under Rich Daley both have been replaced by charming neighborhoods lived in for the most part by the go-go young. Once drab and dreary neighborhoods show new buildings, lots of rehab, and Starbucks as far as the eye can see. Where squalor once was, youthful gentry now reside.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everywhere around the city flowers and trees have been planted. The new Millennium Park, with its Frank Gehry outdoor concert hall, skating rink, modern sculptures, charming walkways, and fields for lolling is a great hit with everyone who has seen it. The Chicago of my youth, filled with gruff cigar-smoking pols in size 48 suits, suddenly seems a city for the young, who appear delighted to be in a city with so much to offer and themselves lend the metropolis a winning liveliness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Between the Daleys, especially when Harold Washington and his successor Eugene Sawyer, both black men, were in office, racial feeling in the city was raw and the confrontations between blacks and whites in the City Council was ugly. Rich Daley has done a good deal to eliminate that. No one, I think, would say that he is in the least racist. Cliche though it sounds, he really does seem to want to be the mayor of all Chicagoans. In the 2003 four-candidate mayoral election, he won 79% of the vote, though voter turnout was down to only 34%, expressing either satisfaction or voter apathy, or (most likely) confidence that he was unbeatable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rich Daley appears to have no theory of government, but merely a boundless appetite for governing. He is a fix-it, a problem-solving, man, treating the city of Chicago as if it were an unending episode of ""This Old House"" -- and he seems to be turning the old heap into a damn stately mansion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps the real secret behind the Daley family success is the fixed but limited ambition of both father and son. Neither Dick nor Rich Daley ever aspired to rise any higher than Mayor of the City of Chicago. Dick Daley, doubtless, enjoyed being a kingmaker and a power in the Democratic Party; this would appear to be less true of Rich Daley, but then the age of king-making Democratic Party bosses seems to be over. A homeboy, the current mayor does not wish to become governor or a U.S. senator, or -- here's a thought to pass on to the search committee in Cambridge -- the next president of Harvard. That goes a good way to explaining why he is so good at his job and why he is likely to be able to keep it for as long as he likes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Epstein is the author, most recently, of ""Envy"" (Oxford, 2003).</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Not long after stealing one Supreme Court seat, Republicans will have a chance to fill a second and move the court further to the right.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the confirmation process could still turn out to be productive for Democrats — or it could become the worst of all worlds, both frustrating and damaging. The key now for the party and its voters is to understand the difference between those outcomes. Here’s a three-step guide to doing so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step one: Be realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump’s nominee is overwhelmingly likely to be confirmed regardless of what actions Democrats take. Republicans hold the Senate majority, and every Republican senator — yes, including Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski — has a history of voting for judges like those Trump is considering. Collins and Murkowski have a script: They make centrist-sounding statements, to shore up their images, and then vote aye.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So Democrats should go into the confirmation debate recognizing that it is almost certainly unwinnable. It will not depend on how hard Democratic leaders fight or which tactics they choose, alluring as that fantasy may be. In these polarized times, court nominations unite political parties, even more than individual issues, like, say, health care.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, Senator Elizabeth Warren called the coming nomination “the fight of our lives.” It is not. The great political fights are still ahead. When a new justice is sworn in this fall, Democrats should not declare generational defeat or turn on each other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step two: Don’t lose hope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol has spent decades studying political power and change, from the Civil War to the Tea Party and anti-Trump resistance. She believes that Kennedy’s retirement can be a clarifying moment for American liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the last half-century, conservatives have put more energy into building a movement — creating ideological institutions, grooming judges and, perhaps above all, winning local, state and congressional elections. Democrats have emphasized higher-profile politics, like the presidency and landmark court cases. Democrats can’t afford to do so anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years to come, the Supreme Court is likely to have a very conservative majority. But remember that the modern conservative movement began when the court seemed implacably liberal, under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and ’60s. “Conservatives were facing a Washington complex that horrified them,” Skocpol told me, “so they built from the bottom up.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember, too, the limits of the court’s power. On some big issues, the court is not imposing right-wing policies on the entire country. It is instead refusing to ban state-based right-wing policies — like abortion restrictions and partisan gerrymandering — that progressives consider unconstitutional. (And, by the way, the court was already doing so with Kennedy .)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Progressives can still win many of these issues. They simply will have to do so in a small-d democratic way, by winning elections — as they’ve begun to do lately . If Democrats win more governorships and state legislatures, they can keep Republicans from drawing ridiculous congressional maps and infringing on African-Americans’ voting rights — among many other things. If Democrats retake Congress this fall, they can halt the Republican legislative agenda and gain subpoena power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I realize that a post-Kennedy Supreme Court may one day start throwing out progressive legislation, as happened in the early 20th century. But that’s a fight for another day. Most experts I’ve talked to — scholars and people in politics — believe that elected politicians can prevail in a long-term struggle with unelected judges. Regardless, until Democrats win more elections, it’s a hypothetical concern. “The potential center-left majority in this country — and it’s very real — has to actually organize and elect people to office,” Skocpol says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step three: Know your strengths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democrats will be tempted to turn the next two months into a national conversation about abortion, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and other social issues that inspire liberal passion. That would be a mistake. Those are not the best issues for Democrats during a midterm campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The best issues are those on which Democrats hold a decisive advantage in public opinion . Health insurance is a good example. So are taxation, corporate power and the Trump administration’s corruption. All of these issues can be grist for a nominee’s Senate hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I’m not suggesting that Democratic senators ignore social issues. They just shouldn’t fool themselves into thinking that the country is further to the left than it is . For instance, about two-thirds of Americans believe abortion should be illegal at least sometimes, according to Gallup , and many of the strongest opponents base their votes on the issue. That’s why Republicans are happy to have these arguments .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nothing in American politics matters more right now than the outcome of the midterms. It is the difference between emboldening Trump and starting to hold him accountable. It really may be “the fight of our lives.” And unlike the confirmation battle, the midterms remain up for grabs. In the coming weeks, Democrats will be talking about the Supreme Court, but they should be thinking about the midterms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: David Leonhardt</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Recent anti-Semitic incidents spurred the regents to want to take action, but at their Sept. 17 meeting, they chose not to adopt proposed ""principles against intolerance."" Instead, they created a committee to consider the issue anew. The reality, however, is that the chance of a breakthrough is low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Any written policy would need to achieve conflicting goals: expressing a strong commitment to freedom of speech as an integral aspect of education, while seeking to prevent speech that is racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. The trick is in setting the border between heated, even inflammatory, speech and hate speech, which is notoriously difficult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court long has held that vague speech rules violate the 1st Amendment and deny due process of law. In fact, efforts at defining hate speech by other state universities have been declared unconstitutional on vagueness grounds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Michigan, for example, adopted a code in the 1980s -- later struck down by the Supreme Court -- that prohibited ""any behavior, verbal or physical, that stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-era veteran status.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what does it mean to ""stigmatize"" or ""victimize""? If a professor or student agues that there are inherent differences between men and women, does that violate the policy? Can advocacy of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> be deemed to violate this policy because it stigmatizes racial minorities by assuming that they need preferential treatment to compete?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with principles of intolerance, activists on UC campuses are urging the Board of Regents to adopt the State Department definition of anti-Semitism, which includes trying to ""demonize Israel,"" ""delegitimize Israel"" or applying a ""double-standard to Israel."" But who is fit to judge when criticism of Israel's policies and actions veers into demonization? If a student states that Palestinians should have a right of return, is she seeking to delegitimize Israel or just airing a controversial opinion? What if she says the country's founding was a mistake?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the 1st Amendment, there is no such thing as a false idea and all viewpoints may be expressed. The 1st Amendment even protects the right to deny the Holocaust or advocate the subjugation of a supposedly inferior group. There unquestionably is a 1st Amendment right to argue against (or for) the existence of Israel or to contend that it should meet (or not have to meet) higher standards of human rights than other nations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These difficulties have led some campuses to take a softer approach: adopting community speech guidelines or principles, while pledging not to punish those who violate those principles. Campus administrators can feel that they are taking positive actions without fearing constitutional challenges. Also, they can remind students that just because there is a 1st Amendment right to say something, that doesn't mean it should be said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But such middleground policies always seem to leave everyone dissatisfied. Those who want to prevent hate speech see them as toothless or ineffectual because they cannot be enforced. Those who are most concerned about protecting freedom of expression on campus still worry that they will chill speech and inhibit discussion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is there a solution to all of this? Is there anything the regents committee and other universities can try?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My advice would be to draft a policy that focuses on reaffirming the importance of free expression while defining what is not constitutionally protected. There is no 1st Amendment right to threaten or harass another person or to deface someone else's property.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The policy should not seek to inhibit or limit protected speech, no matter how offensive it might be. The policy should seek to define, with as much precision as possible, what types of speech and conduct cross the line and are impermissible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should also remember that universities have the right to free speech too, and can and should speak out against inflammatory speech that targets members of the university community. This, of course, is consistent with the educational mission of universities and a basic principle of the 1st Amendment: the best remedy for the speech we dislike is more speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Erwin Chemerinsky is the dean of the UC Irvine School of Law.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

It’s time to pop the bubble.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you have spent any time around conservative politics, you will have heard the inevitable grousing about liberal media bias and how much harder this makes it for Republicans to win elections. Journalists, of course, question whether this is true — though this position grows steadily less defensible, particularly when considering coverage of social issues, in which acclaim of the left-wing position is near-universal among the ""mainstream.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lately, though, I've begun doubting whether Republicans and those who agree with them are right — wondering whether media defenders shouldn't just say: Hell yes, Republicans, the media has a left-wing bias, but don't worry, that hurts Democrats more than you.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My most recent occasion for these musings was a column that Ezra Klein of the New York Times wrote about David Shor, a progressive election analyst. Shor thinks the left has a major problem with its youthful and well-educated activist base, which staffs left-leaning newsrooms and runs campaigns. They focus, naturally, on issues that excite them, and Shor told Klein ""the things that are most exciting to activists and journalists are politically toxic.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change, for example, is something that very liberal White people ""care way more about"" than anyone else, according to Shor, so when you focus on it, ""you sound like a weird, very liberal white person."" Even immigration and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have proved surprisingly unpopular with the very voters of color they were supposed to woo.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shor has his detractors, of course. Their objections might be summed up by progressive strategist Anat Shenker-Osorio's response to Klein: ""The job of a good message isn't to say what's popular but to make popular what needs to be said."" Democrats of her persuasion might prefer the framing advocated by law professor Ian Haney Lopez: ""The idea is to shift the basic political conflict in the United States from one between racial groups (the right's preferred frame) to one between the 0.1% and the rest of us, with racism as their principal weapon.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To me, Shor's vision — sort your ideas by popularity, then ""Start at the top, and work your way down to find something that excites people"" — sounds less inspiring but more likely to help Democrats get and hold power. It doesn't require Democrats to persuade voters that, say, an Asian American assistant professor has exactly the same interests as a rural, White call-center worker or a Hispanic plumber and that only a conspiracy of the very rich prevents them from realizing it. Democrats merely have to learn what voters already want.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But while Shor's more prosaic strategy might be an easier sell to voters, it is apt to be a harder sell to the young idealists who staff campaigns and newsrooms. And the newsrooms might be a bigger problem than the political class.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Matt Yglesias pointed out on Twitter, ""A closed circle of young, college educated staffers is likely to end up further off-center the more they talk to themselves."" The mainstream media, and staffers' internal fights spilling onto Twitter, are an important part of how the progressive vanguard talks to itself — and as the media skews ever-leftward, it helps sustain a rarefied bubble where divisive slogans such as ""defund the police"" can be questioned only with great delicacy, while significantly more popular propositions like ""use the military to help police quell riots"" cannot be defended at all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This inevitably affects campaign coverage, and in ways that arguably make it harder for Democrats to pivot away from divisive identity politics. Shor can insist all he wants that Hillary Clinton's campaign ought to have focused on her higher-polling economic message, but as his critics note, the media paid far more attention to Trump's problems with immigrants, women and racial minorities, leaving Clinton limited scope to set a different agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media can probably afford to live in that bubble, even if it means that the public identifies commentators and other journalists as extensions of left-wing political campaigns, rather than neutral arbiters. (Many Republicans already see the media that way, and independents may be starting to.) Outlets depend less and less on advertisers that shun controversy and more on a select group of highly educated, politically engaged subscribers who generally prefer Democrats to Republicans, and may well prefer the linguistic politics of the educated class — ""Latinx"" instead of ""Hispanic,"" or ""birthing people"" instead of ""women"" — and policies such as defunding the police over putting more cops on the street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats cannot afford to cater only to that hyper-educated class — not in a country where only a third of the population has a bachelor's degree. But if Shor is right, moving to where the voters are will require the highly engaged staffers and donors to sacrifice their own interests and commitments to political expedience. Naturally, they will look for reasons they don't have to. The danger is that a media that shares their commitments will provide those reasons, right up to the point where the left has talked itself into an electoral disaster too big for anyone to deny.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

All but two Democrats voted ""nay.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rejection of a Supreme Court nominee is unusual but not unheard of (see Clement Haynsworth Jr.). But rarely has a failed nominee had the pedigree -- and intellectual firepower -- of Bork. He had been a law professor at Yale, the solicitor general of the United States and, at the time Ronald Reagan tapped him for the court, a federal appeals court judge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, Bork was a legal intellectual, a proponent of original intent and judicial restraint. The task of the judge, he once wrote, is ""to discern how the framers' values, defined in the context of the world they knew, apply to the world we know."" He said that Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion, was a ""wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation"" of authority that belonged to the states, that the court's recent rulings on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> were problematic and that the First Amendment didn't apply to pornography.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whatever you think of these views, they cannot be fairly characterized as extreme; Ruth Bader Ginsburg, among many others, has questioned the rationale offered by the court to justify Roe v. Wade. Nor was Bork himself an extremist. He was a strongly opinionated, somewhat pugnacious, deeply conservative judge. (At 84 today, he hasn't mellowed much either, to judge from an interview he recently gave Newsweek.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I bring up Bork not only because Sunday is a convenient anniversary. His nomination battle is also a reminder that our poisoned politics is not just about Republicans behaving badly, as many Democrats and their liberal allies have convinced themselves. Democrats can be -- and have been -- every bit as obstructionist, mean-spirited and unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'll take it one step further. The Bork fight, in some ways, was the beginning of the end of civil discourse in politics. For years afterward, conservatives seethed at the ""systematic demonization"" of Bork, recalls Clint Bolick, a longtime conservative legal activist. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution coined the angry verb ""to bork,"" which meant to destroy a nominee by whatever means necessary. When Republicans borked the Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright less than two years later, there wasn't a trace of remorse, not after what the Democrats had done to Bork. The anger between Democrats and Republicans, the unwillingness to work together, the profound mistrust -- the line from Bork to today's ugly politics is a straight one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is, to be sure, completely understandable that the Democrats wanted to keep Bork off the court. Lewis Powell, the great moderate, was stepping down, which would be leaving the court evenly divided between conservatives and liberals. There was tremendous fear that if Bork were confirmed, he would swing the court to the conservatives and important liberal victories would be overturned -- starting with Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But liberals couldn't just come out and say that. ""If this were carried out as an internal Senate debate,"" Ann Lewis, the Democratic activist, would later acknowledge, ""we would have deep and thoughtful discussions about the Constitution, and then we would lose."" So, instead, the Democrats sought to portray Bork as ""a right-wing loony,"" to use a phrase in a memo written by the Advocacy Institute, a liberal lobby group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The character assassination began the day Bork was nominated, when Ted Kennedy gave a fiery speech describing ""Robert Bork's America"" as a place ""in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters,"" and so on. It continued until the day the nomination was voted down; one ad, for instance, claimed, absurdly, that Bork wanted to give ""women workers the choice between sterilization and their job.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives were stunned by the relentlessness -- and the essential unfairness -- of the attacks. But the truth is that many of the liberals fighting the nomination also knew they were unfair. That same Advocacy Institute memo noted that, ""Like it or not, Bork falls (perhaps barely) at the borderline of respectability."" It didn't matter. He had to be portrayed ""as an extreme ideological activist."" The ends were used to justify some truly despicable means.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, of course, the court has a conservative majority, and liberal victories are, indeed, being overturned. Interestingly, Bolick says Bork's beliefs would have made him a restraining force. Theodore Olson, who served as solicitor general under George W. Bush, also pointed out that after Bork, nominees would scarcely acknowledge that they had rich and nuanced judicial philosophies for fear of giving ammunition to the other side. Those philosophies would be unveiled only after they were on the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mostly, though, the point remains this: The next time a liberal asks why Republicans are so intransigent, you might suggest that the answer lies in the mirror.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Many people I interact with outside my job don’t even know that I am a professor, or that I have a doctoral degree. When I introduce myself in public, I’m Carlotta Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when I introduce myself in the classroom, I’m Dr. Berry. And I insist on being Dr. Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Titles in the academy are inconsistent at best. I have colleagues who would prefer to be called by their first name, or nicknames like “Bone Saw.” But they are mostly men, and almost all white, and they have that luxury. As an African-American woman in a mostly Caucasian- and male-dominated field, I don’t.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some find my insistence on this formality a bit pretentious or arrogant. But they don’t understand my story, and that of many other women and people of color in the academy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having worked with thousands of students, I know for a fact that for many — though by no means all, or even most — there is already a presumption that I, as a female and African-American, am less qualified than my white male colleagues, or at the very least that I was hired in order to meet a double minority quota. And I get it — anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> ideologues have managed to not only demolish the legitimacy of that policy, but tar the reputation of anyone who might have benefited from it (even if, like me, they did not).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do I know? Sometimes it’s just a sense, a feeling I get from people’s tone of voice. But some students will automatically call me Ms., while naturally referring to my male counterparts as Doctor or Professor. I’m not alone: When I meet fellow female engineering professors at conferences, this sort of treatment is always a topic of conversation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In class, I have my derivations questioned, lectures critiqued, grading regarded as too harsh or unfair and my expectations dismissed as too high or difficult. I once had a student who would review notes with me that he had taken on my lecture, then offer tips on how I could improve. It seems he thought he was doing me a favor, despite the fact that I had been teaching for six years by then. I doubt that this is an experience that many of my male colleagues have ever had to endure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On other occasions, I have had students state that it is difficult to follow my lectures because of my dialect or slang (neither of which I have, or use).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what can I do? I already have to run faster and jump higher just to gain that minimal level of respect that my colleagues are graciously, automatically afforded. But I can also insist that my students interact with me in a professional manner, even if it’s not something they’re accustomed to in other classes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I tell friends outside the academy about these challenges, they’re often surprised. It’s 2014, and this is higher education, where enlightened worldviews are supposed to dominate. But consider that according to data from the American Society for Engineering Education, as of 2011 African-American women made up 4 percent of all women in the engineering professoriate. Between 2001 and 2012, the number of African-American engineering faculty members increased to 3 percent from 2 percent. In all, in 2012 there were only 140 African-American women working as engineering professors — out of some 24,640 across the entire field (not including computer engineering).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For me, this statistical desert is made even more stark by the fact that, at a private school in a Midwestern town like mine, students may have interacted with African-Americans only in the service industry, or in high school, with female teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I decided to become an engineering professor 20 years ago while sitting in class and realizing that I had never had a professor who looked like me, acted like me or even seemed interested in me. I was typically one of only two or three female students, and one of only one or two African-American students. I wanted to change the face of engineering by showing that the profession could be cool, interesting, exciting, engaging and, most important, diverse. In that way, insisting that students use my title isn’t just about me — it’s about broadcasting, to any female and black students who might hear it, that I am black, a woman, and an engineer, and that they can be the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I enter my classroom today, I am still one of only two or three women in my department (depending on how you count the faculty), and I am one of only one or two African-Americans. Still, I hope that someday, when an African-American woman walks into an engineering classroom, the students recognize that the professor has arrived, and that she won’t have to insist on their calling her Doctor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college.

5e6cd7d5e1924c2888545bbb	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2236765173.xml.txt	"<div><p>How to Save Affirmative Action</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton Administration's reversal of position on a case that could be one of the most important of the Supreme Court's coming term has disappointed supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. But given the tenor of the Court's recent decisions on racial preferences, the Administration has made a smart strategic move to preserve what can and should be saved of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case concerns the decision of the Piscataway, N.J., school board to promote racial diversity by laying off a white teacher so that it could preserve the job of an equally qualified black teacher. Though the Administration had previously supported the school board, the brief it filed with the Supreme Court on Aug. 23 concedes that the board violated the civil rights of the white teacher.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In previous rulings, the Court has maintained that government use of racial preferences is constitutional only when such action is necessary to remedy a history of overt discrimination, or when the public goal being pursued is ''compelling.'' Moreover, the Court has said, the use of racial preferences must be ''narrowly tailored'' to meet the particular goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appellate court that heard the Piscataway case declared, in effect, that racial diversity could never be a compelling state interest. Should the Supreme Court completely uphold the appellate court's ruling, the use of race in decisions about hiring and firing public employees could, for all practical purposes, be prohibited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Piscataway case, the avowed goal -- racial diversity within a single, small department of an otherwise diverse faculty -- does not seem ''compelling.'' And the way the school board chose to pursue its goal of diversity -- dismissing a white teacher solely because of her race -- was not ''narrowly tailored.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By acknowledging this, yet at the same time making a broader argument for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, the Administration hopes to preserve some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring. The approach it has suggested in its brief is essentially a compromise. Even if the Piscataway school board was wrong in this specific instance in its use of racial preference, the Administration argues, there is still a place for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and not only to remedy past discrimination. Indeed, as it points out in its brief, there are times when taking race into account is the only way to further compelling public goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A police department, for example, may need to recruit a diverse officer corps to carry on effective undercover work or to retain public confidence in neighborhoods where there are racial tensions. At schools and colleges, a diverse faculty may, through the example of its own collegiality, teach students important lessons about working across racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the absolutist opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have the upper hand, in the courts as well as in the broader public debate. California now outlaws the use of race in public hiring, contracting and education. And in a case challenging <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> at the University of Texas Law School, a Federal appeals court ruled last year that racial diversity in a student body could never constitute a compelling state interest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court declined to review that decision, but in taking on the Piscataway case, the Court has the opportunity to clarify the question of when, if ever, it is legitimate to use <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> to achieve racial diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a grave error for the Court to adopt an absolutist color-blind view on the question of whether race should ever be a factor in decisions about public employment. Moreover, it is impossible to maintain such absolutism and still uphold a commitment to prevent racial discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider efforts to recruit job applicants that are directed toward minority candidates -- as when companies send recruiters to heavily black schools when blacks are underrepresented in their work force. Such efforts would clearly violate the color-blind principle. Even when the final hiring decision is made solely on the basis of an applicant's qualifications, without regard to race, these recruitment programs involve discrimination because they bestow the benefits of better job information and a greater number of alternative job offers on some individuals solely because of their race. Yet these programs are widespread in both the public and the private sectors, and they are needed to prevent discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to public employment, the Administration makes a strong case for considering race. Indeed, its argument could also be applied to the lifetime appointments to the Federal courts that interpret the constitutionality of race-based state action. The legitimacy of court rulings in this area would surely be undermined by the absence from the bench of nonwhite members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't mean that racial quotas should be used for judicial appointments. But as far as the Federal judiciary is concerned, there is a compelling public interest in racial diversity for its own sake.

And as news it's not in the same league as the total war waged against Harvard president Lawrence Summers for having had the temerity to suggest that factors in addition to prejudice might have something to do with the under-representation of women in math and the sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, what happened at Purdue is a pungent reminder of all that's possible now in the rarefied ideological atmosphere on our college campuses -- and in this presidential election year, not perhaps only on our campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story began prosaically enough. Keith Sampson, a student employee on the janitorial staff earning his way toward a degree, was in the habit of reading during work breaks. Last October he was immersed in ""Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson was in short order visited by his union representative, who informed him he must not bring this book to the break room, and that he could be fired. Taking the book to the campus, Mr. Sampson says he was told, was ""like bringing pornography to work."" That it was a history of the battle students waged against the Klan in the 1920s in no way impressed the union rep.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The assistant <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer who next summoned the student was similarly unimpressed. Indeed she was, Mr. Sampson says, irate at his explanation that he was, after all, reading a scholarly book. ""The Klan still rules Indiana,"" Marguerite Watkins told him -- didn't he know that? Mr. Sampson, by now dazed, pointed out that this book was carried in the university library. Yes, she retorted, you can get Klan propaganda in the library.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university has allowed no interviews with Ms. Watkins or any other university official involved in the case. Still, there can be no disputing the contents of the official letter that set forth the university's case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson stood accused of ""openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your Black co-workers."" The statement, signed by chief <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer Lillian Charleston, asserted that her office had completed its investigation of the charges brought by Ms. Nakea William, his co- worker -- that Mr. Sampson had continued, despite complaints, to read a book on this ""inflammatory topic."" ""We conclude,"" the letter informed him, ""that your conduct constitutes racial harassment. . . ."" A very serious matter, with serious consequences, it went on to point out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was in November. Months later, in February of this year, Mr. Sampson received -- from the same source -- a letter with an astonishingly transformed version of his offense. And there could be no mystery as to the cause of this change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the official judgment against him, Mr. Sampson turned to Indiana state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, whose office contacted university attorneys. Worse, the case got some sharp local press coverage that threatened to get wider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ludicrous harassment cases are not rare at our institutions of higher learning. But there was undeniably something special -- something pure, and glorious -- in the clarity of this picture. A university had brought a case against a student on grounds of a book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so the new letter to Mr. Sampson by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer Charleston brought word that she wished to clarify her previous letter, and to say it was ""permissible for him to read scholarly books or other materials on break time."" About the essential and only theme of the first letter -- the ""racially abhorrent"" subject of the book -- or the warnings that any ""future substantiated conduct of a similar nature could mean serious disciplinary action"" -- there was not a word. She had meant in that first letter, she said, only to address ""conduct"" that caused concern among his co-workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What that conduct was, the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer did not reveal -- but she had delivered the message rewriting the history of the case. Absolutely and for certain there had been no problem about any book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This, indeed, was now the official story -- as any journalist asking about the case would learn instantly from the university's media relations representatives. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved -- if not much -- by the extraordinary efforts of these tormented agents trying to explain that the first letter was all wrong: No reading of any book had anything to do with the charges against Mr. Sampson. This means, I asked one, that Mr. Sampson could have been reading about the adventures of Jack and Jill and he still would have been charged? Yes. What, then, was the offense? ""Harassing behavior."" While reading the book? The question led to careful explanations hopeless in tone -- for good reason -- and well removed from all semblance of reason. What the behavior was, one learned, could never be revealed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was, of course, no other offensive behavior; had there been any it would surely have appeared in the first letter's gusher of accusation. Like those prosecutors who invent new charges when the first ones fail in court, the administrators threw in the mysterious harassment count. Such were the operations of the university's guardians of equity and justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In April -- having been pressed by the potent national watchdog group FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) as well as the ACLU -- University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz finally sent them a letter expressing regret over this affair, and testifying to his profound commitment to freedom of expression. So far as can be ascertained, the university has extended no such expressions of regret to Keith Sampson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This case and all its kind are worth bearing in mind for anyone pondering the hypersensitivity surrounding the issue of race today. The mindset that produces those harassment courts, those super-heated capacities for perceiving insult, is not limited to college campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its presence is evident in this election campaign, which has seen more than a touch of readiness to impute some form of racism to all tough criticisms of Barack Obama. The deranged response that greeted Bill Clinton's remark that certain of Sen. Obama's claims were ""a fairy tale,"" told the story. No need to go into the now famous catalogue of accusations about the Clintons' ""sly racist"" tactics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There will be much more ahead, directed to the Republicans and their candidate. Some more, no doubt, about the Willie Horton ad of 1988, whose status as a quintessential piece of racism is -- except for a few rare voices of reason -- accepted throughout our media as revealed truth. To be sure, the Willie Horton charge has for some time been over-shadowed by ominous predictions of all the Swiftboating Republicans are supposed to be readying.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Obama himself, the candidate of racial transcendence, has now taken a plunge of sorts to old-style race politics. In a preemptive dismissal of future criticism, he warned a Florida audience on June 20, of the racist tactics the Republicans planned. ""We know the strategy,"" he said. Republicans planned to make people afraid of him. They'd say ""he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this may be far from the world of the universities. But to those aforementioned campus ideologues, the thinking is familiar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Correction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yesterday's op-ed article by Dorothy Rabinowitz, ""American Politics Aren't 'Post-Racial',"" misstated the name of the university. It is Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, not Purdue University. IUPUI is a partnership between Indiana University and Purdue University. Indiana University is the managing partner of IUPUI and is ""fully under the administrative authority of Indiana University,"" according to a Purdue spokesman, who added that ""Purdue University officials were not consulted and in no way were involved in any aspect of [Keith] Sampson's case.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(WSJ July 8, 2008)</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

Not long after stealing one Supreme Court seat, Republicans will have a chance to fill a second and move the court further to the right.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the confirmation process could still turn out to be productive for Democrats — or it could become the worst of all worlds, both frustrating and damaging. The key now for the party and its voters is to understand the difference between those outcomes. Here’s a three-step guide to doing so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step one: Be realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump’s nominee is overwhelmingly likely to be confirmed regardless of what actions Democrats take. Republicans hold the Senate majority, and every Republican senator — yes, including Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski — has a history of voting for judges like those Trump is considering. Collins and Murkowski have a script: They make centrist-sounding statements, to shore up their images, and then vote aye.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So Democrats should go into the confirmation debate recognizing that it is almost certainly unwinnable. It will not depend on how hard Democratic leaders fight or which tactics they choose, alluring as that fantasy may be. In these polarized times, court nominations unite political parties, even more than individual issues, like, say, health care.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, Senator Elizabeth Warren called the coming nomination “the fight of our lives.” It is not. The great political fights are still ahead. When a new justice is sworn in this fall, Democrats should not declare generational defeat or turn on each other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step two: Don’t lose hope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol has spent decades studying political power and change, from the Civil War to the Tea Party and anti-Trump resistance. She believes that Kennedy’s retirement can be a clarifying moment for American liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the last half-century, conservatives have put more energy into building a movement — creating ideological institutions, grooming judges and, perhaps above all, winning local, state and congressional elections. Democrats have emphasized higher-profile politics, like the presidency and landmark court cases. Democrats can’t afford to do so anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years to come, the Supreme Court is likely to have a very conservative majority. But remember that the modern conservative movement began when the court seemed implacably liberal, under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and ’60s. “Conservatives were facing a Washington complex that horrified them,” Skocpol told me, “so they built from the bottom up.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember, too, the limits of the court’s power. On some big issues, the court is not imposing right-wing policies on the entire country. It is instead refusing to ban state-based right-wing policies — like abortion restrictions and partisan gerrymandering — that progressives consider unconstitutional. (And, by the way, the court was already doing so with Kennedy .)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Progressives can still win many of these issues. They simply will have to do so in a small-d democratic way, by winning elections — as they’ve begun to do lately . If Democrats win more governorships and state legislatures, they can keep Republicans from drawing ridiculous congressional maps and infringing on African-Americans’ voting rights — among many other things. If Democrats retake Congress this fall, they can halt the Republican legislative agenda and gain subpoena power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I realize that a post-Kennedy Supreme Court may one day start throwing out progressive legislation, as happened in the early 20th century. But that’s a fight for another day. Most experts I’ve talked to — scholars and people in politics — believe that elected politicians can prevail in a long-term struggle with unelected judges. Regardless, until Democrats win more elections, it’s a hypothetical concern. “The potential center-left majority in this country — and it’s very real — has to actually organize and elect people to office,” Skocpol says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step three: Know your strengths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democrats will be tempted to turn the next two months into a national conversation about abortion, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and other social issues that inspire liberal passion. That would be a mistake. Those are not the best issues for Democrats during a midterm campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The best issues are those on which Democrats hold a decisive advantage in public opinion . Health insurance is a good example. So are taxation, corporate power and the Trump administration’s corruption. All of these issues can be grist for a nominee’s Senate hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I’m not suggesting that Democratic senators ignore social issues. They just shouldn’t fool themselves into thinking that the country is further to the left than it is . For instance, about two-thirds of Americans believe abortion should be illegal at least sometimes, according to Gallup , and many of the strongest opponents base their votes on the issue. That’s why Republicans are happy to have these arguments .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nothing in American politics matters more right now than the outcome of the midterms. It is the difference between emboldening Trump and starting to hold him accountable. It really may be “the fight of our lives.” And unlike the confirmation battle, the midterms remain up for grabs. In the coming weeks, Democrats will be talking about the Supreme Court, but they should be thinking about the midterms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: David Leonhardt</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Not always, not everywhere -- and not, apparently, here in Chicago, where one family, the Daleys, has controlled the political action from City Hall for going on four decades. Richard J. Daley, or Daley pere, was mayor of the city from 1955 to 1976, and died in office; Richard M. Daley, or Daley fils, began his run in 1989, and it begins to look as if I, who am five years his elder, am quite likely to die while he is still in office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From time to time a local politician makes a noise suggesting that he would like to make a run at the Daley dynasty, as by now it must be reckoned. Most recently, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., who does a fair impression of a serious politician -- unlike his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who does a very poor imitation of Martin Luther King Jr. -- has criticized Daley fils for yet another of the small- and large-bore scandals -- this one having to do with <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> contracts -- that are as indispensable to Chicago politics as nitrogen to plant life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Jackson is on record as saying, ""I am concerned about the reports of rampant corruption and fraud and abuse in the city. I'm interested in our city restoring honesty and integrity in our government."" (Pause here for chortle followed by yawn.) He also insists that he has no intention of opposing Daley fils in his run for his sixth term as mayor in 2007, though he wouldn't rule it out. (Pause here for raised left eyebrow followed by cynical smile.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet whoever might run against him in 2007 -- even if candidates were to include a combined reincarnation of Winston Churchill, Gandhi, Disraeli, and the Archangel Michael -- Daley fils will be, as they say in Vegas, a prohibitive favorite. To be sure, he has done some very high-handed things in office; the most impressive of all in this line was plowing up Meigs Field, the city's small downtown lakeshore airport the survival of which everyone else thought was still up for discussion, and doing it, as the mystery writers like to say, by dark of night. But most Chicagoans don't seem to hold any of it against him. Hey, the kid's OK.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corruption, like sexual satisfaction, is relative. Corruption under Daley pere was widespread and wide open. Everything that passed through City Hall was for sale: health and building inspectors, cops, judges, even in one notorious instance -- the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon presidential election -- the White House. (I first heard the motto ""Vote early, vote often"" during this election, where it was more a modus operandi than a mere motto.) Some people see corruption as intrinsic to, if not inherent in, big-city government, and I'm afraid that I happen to be one of them, but then I'm an American, like the man said, Chicago-born.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one has ever accused the Daleys, father or son, of being thieves. Their interest has never been in money -- only in what money can do to smooth the way to power, which for them has always been the real point and prize of politics. Critics of Rich Daley -- the father was known as Dick, a harder name for a more obdurate man -- say that politics in Chicago under him is business as usual. I don't believe this is quite so, but in any case if corruption has gone on during his administrations, he at least has provided real compensations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chicago was once a city distinguished by having not one but two skid rows: one on south State Street, the other on west Madison. Under Rich Daley both have been replaced by charming neighborhoods lived in for the most part by the go-go young. Once drab and dreary neighborhoods show new buildings, lots of rehab, and Starbucks as far as the eye can see. Where squalor once was, youthful gentry now reside.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everywhere around the city flowers and trees have been planted. The new Millennium Park, with its Frank Gehry outdoor concert hall, skating rink, modern sculptures, charming walkways, and fields for lolling is a great hit with everyone who has seen it. The Chicago of my youth, filled with gruff cigar-smoking pols in size 48 suits, suddenly seems a city for the young, who appear delighted to be in a city with so much to offer and themselves lend the metropolis a winning liveliness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Between the Daleys, especially when Harold Washington and his successor Eugene Sawyer, both black men, were in office, racial feeling in the city was raw and the confrontations between blacks and whites in the City Council was ugly. Rich Daley has done a good deal to eliminate that. No one, I think, would say that he is in the least racist. Cliche though it sounds, he really does seem to want to be the mayor of all Chicagoans. In the 2003 four-candidate mayoral election, he won 79% of the vote, though voter turnout was down to only 34%, expressing either satisfaction or voter apathy, or (most likely) confidence that he was unbeatable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rich Daley appears to have no theory of government, but merely a boundless appetite for governing. He is a fix-it, a problem-solving, man, treating the city of Chicago as if it were an unending episode of ""This Old House"" -- and he seems to be turning the old heap into a damn stately mansion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps the real secret behind the Daley family success is the fixed but limited ambition of both father and son. Neither Dick nor Rich Daley ever aspired to rise any higher than Mayor of the City of Chicago. Dick Daley, doubtless, enjoyed being a kingmaker and a power in the Democratic Party; this would appear to be less true of Rich Daley, but then the age of king-making Democratic Party bosses seems to be over. A homeboy, the current mayor does not wish to become governor or a U.S. senator, or -- here's a thought to pass on to the search committee in Cambridge -- the next president of Harvard. That goes a good way to explaining why he is so good at his job and why he is likely to be able to keep it for as long as he likes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Epstein is the author, most recently, of ""Envy"" (Oxford, 2003).</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

The lessons here are instructive. The ballot measure claimed to end “preferential treatment” in state schools. It resulted in a 25% reduction in Black student enrollment at state colleges and universities — the largest decline among all groups. Two decades later, UC’s Black enrollment is about 5%; it was slightly more than 7% pre-Prop. 209.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the executive director of Black College Success — a community-based nonprofit that provides academic pathways to colleges and universities for hundreds of Black students in South Los Angeles — I’m forced to reckon with the difficulty of improving such statistics. You should know that 75% of Black students from the Los Angeles Unified School District don’t enroll in and 85% don’t graduate from a four-year college or university. They come from communities where the median family income is less than $48,000 a year, and where less than 10% of community members have a college degree.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite these terrible odds, in May, the Black College Success team celebrated the admission of 208 students to more than 40 colleges and universities, including prestigious institutions such as Stanford, Pepperdine, Pitzer, Tulane and New York University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was far from easy for these students. For instance, Jackson, 18 and headed to a competitive school in the northeast, grew up in a single-parent household with a hardworking father who drives for Amazon, faced the challenges of being a Black man in L.A., avoiding gang life and supporting his siblings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ajaa, 17, will be a freshman at an HBCU — a historically Black college or university — in Georgia. She won more than $100,000 in scholarships while working part time to support her family, including take care of her younger brother so that her mother could attend school too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We’re not only trying to shatter the boundaries Black students from South Los Angeles face in gaining access to college, but to also help make clear the transformative opportunity that college offers their families financially for the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the students we work with will be the first in their families to go to college. And our help doesn’t stop there. To get them to graduation (our first cohort hasn’t yet reached that milestone), we follow them wherever they enroll, with continued counseling about class choices and majors and career possibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, how do we do it? And how will we do it in a post-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> world?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There’s just one way: one student at a time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the work of finding and recruiting high schoolers for the program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning as early as sophomore year (as we continue to expand, we’ll eventually work with students starting the moment they enter high school), a team of “college access managers,” who are from the same neighborhoods as our students and have backgrounds in college recruitment, go into our partner high schools, which have expressed an interest in working with us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The managers figuratively and literally meet the students where they are and offer them an array of supports, starting with academic planning assistance for their A-G requirements, the classes students must complete with a grade of C or better to be eligible to enter the Cal State or UC systems. No matter where students apply, the A-G standards are an objective demonstration that they’re college ready.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At times, the students’ need for mentoring is far greater than our capacity, so we partner with in-school resources, such as the newly created Black Student Achievement Program, and lock arms with other nonprofits like Brotherhood Crusade, 826LA, Los Angeles Urban League and others that can help us provide writing workshops, access to advanced courses and a range of extracurricular activities, stipends for summer internships, career guidance and scholarships.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once our students become seniors, they receive one-on-one college application assistance, personal statement workshops and financial aid advice. We take them on college and university visits and help them evaluate their choices. Our aim is to provide them with everything they need to level the landscape against peers who often enjoy significant advantages, such as private tutors and schools with more funding and resources than those in South L.A.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In doing this work, I’ve learned that it’s not how high a student’s GPA is or how impressive their test scores are that gets results. It’s an all-of-the-above mix of academics, guidance and the students’ own determination — the ability of a Jackson or an Ajaa to persevere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I’ve seen stories like theirs by the dozens. My fear is that, in the unfortunate new world of colorblind admissions, the opportunities available to them will diminish. If colleges and universities look past the distinctive experiences of Black applicants, it’s not just the students who will lose, but society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ibert Schultz is the executive director of Black College Success, a project of the LA Promise Fund.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports	
5e6cd7d5e1924c2888545bbb	test_question_neutral_testing_2	<p>Talking About Race in Akron</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid discussions about race are difficult even in intimate settings among well-acquainted people. For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped.

That's not my view. That's the assessment of Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Bush political appointee before he became head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who says that looming financial calamities in Medicare and Medicaid are larger and more immediate worries in a strictly budgetary sense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As economic calamities go, more significant crises confront the states, which are responsible for our kids' education; the nation's hospitals, which bear the brunt of an overburdened health care system; and international institutions, which have to deal with famine, poverty and HIV/AIDS.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With all these pressing woes, how did Social Security, Terri Schiavo's end-of-life fight and judicial nominations make it to the top of the Washington agenda? It's not merely because the White House or the party in power wants them to be there. It's because deep-rooted, well-heeled organizations have been targeting those issues for years. What seems like serendipity to the public  --  why is Congress talking about trial lawyers again?  --  is more often the result of an interest group's advance work combining with the right circumstances to send an issue hurtling into the limelight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, we increasingly live in a stage-managed democracy where highly orchestrated interests filter our priorities. These groups don't have absolute power, of course. In the nation's capital, home to 30,000 registered lobbyists, hundreds of politicians, thousands of journalists and untold numbers of entrenched bureaucrats, no one's in charge. But long-established entities like the AARP, the Family Research Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce mold our collective thinking and regularly dictate the language and tenor of our civic debates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This notion runs counter to an abiding myth  --  that political leaders actually lead. That's  true sometimes, of course, but more often than not, the ideas and movements that get on the government's to-do list come from the broad middle and not from the top.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A case in point: More than a decade ago, the National Federation of Independent Business, the country's premier small-business lobby, began to methodically contact its half-million members by phone and mail to categorize them by political leanings and their willingness to contact federal lawmakers. The lobby group trained its most eager members at local seminars and sent staffers door-to-door during elections in critical congressional districts. Regular ""grass- roots"" outpourings from this made-to-order machine vaulted NFIB- championed issues onto center stage  --  especially when the Republicans it favored took control of the White House and Congress. In particular, the inheritance tax (which NFIB loyalists redubbed the ""death tax"" for marketing purposes) was repealed (temporarily so far, but Congress is now considering whether to make the repeal permanent). This was the organization's No. 1 priority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The process is a lot like surfing. Interest groups float along, waiting for the perfect wave of public sentiment or official fiat to carry their issues to victory. They can't create the wave, but they can be ready for the moment when it comes. The key is to be prepared for that moment: Not every issue has an organization with the wealth and staying power to be in that position. Those that do have a shot at winning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Lobbying is subtle and complicated,"" says John W. Kingdon, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan who studies interest groups. But the most important attribute of a successful lobbying campaign, he says, is persistence --  something that only entrenched organizations possess.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It takes a sustained organization, mobilized followers and an immense amount of power to get onto a legislative agenda,"" agrees Theodore J. Lowi, a professor of government at Cornell University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, interest groups have replaced political parties as the real influence brokers. Candidates for office rely on these groups for campaign cash, for campaign workers and, increasingly, for campaign issues  --  all of which had once been the domain of the Republican and Democratic national committees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican ground troops come from such diverse groups as the NFIB, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Family Research Council and the National Rifle Association. Democratic soldiers are recruited from places like labor unions, the trial bar and Moveon.org. ""The standard distinction between interest groups and parties used to be that parties were committed to winning elections and that pressure groups let elections happen and then tried to influence the people who got elected,"" Lowi said. ""Now interest groups through their PACs and a variety of other methods are very much involved in the pre- policy arena.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such involvement has become a prime factor in agenda-setting. Take Social Security. Few federal programs attract as much scrutiny. AARP, the nation's largest lobbying organization, is dedicated to keeping Social Security alive and well, as are groups such as the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The reason: Large portions of their membership depend on Social Security checks to survive in old age. AARP has taught a million and a half of its 35 million members how to hammer elected officials by mail, phone and in person, primarily about Social Security.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But AARP has learned that it needs to be careful what it wishes for. Its obsession with the issue has made Social Security a front- of-the-mind topic and, therefore, a perennial contender to shoot to Washington's upper tier. Ideological opponents of the current Social Security system have also been active, raising the issue's profile even higher. Free market think tanks such as the Cato Institute and anti-tax-increase lobbies have been churning out position papers for a quarter-century promoting partial privatization of Social Security as a way to undercut what they see as ""big government."" One appreciator of that work: George W. Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So when the president went looking for a problem to solve that could guarantee him a lasting legacy  --  and, perhaps, realign party domination  --  he went for that old chestnut Social Security. He also embraced a proposal that AARP dislikes  --  the creation of private accounts. That notion has fallen flat largely because of more than $15 million worth of AARP advertising against it. When the process moves to another phase and compromises are explored, AARP is likely to become an important negotiator and perhaps the key indicator of whether the effort will succeed or fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same high-stakes maneuvering couldn't have happened with, say, Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, even though it's in more dire financial straits. Medicaid doesn't have similarly situated citizens' groups beating the bushes on its behalf. So while saving Social Security is the watchword of the day, Medicaid's fate will be to languish and occasionally fend off budget cuts until its finances reach an emergency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Terri Schiavo is another example of interest-group politics at work. The 41-year-old brain-damaged woman was in many ways not out of the ordinary. She was one of thousands of people whose families annually struggle with the question of when a relative's life has ended. But skilled marketers on the well-established, pro-life side of the abortion debate seized on her situation. The National Right to Life Committee, Operation Rescue, Priests for Life, the Family Research Council and others set up Web sites, held news conferences and raised lots of money for lawyers and for themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their pleas touched a chord with millions of Americans and made Schiavo's plight a cause celebre. The omnipresence of her situation in direct-mail communications from those groups and on talk radio made her synonymous with the battle over life and death issues of all kinds  --  from the womb to the grave. By the time Schiavo's parents had finally exhausted their legal options and her feeding tube was about to be removed permanently, the public policy pump had been thoroughly primed. Republican leaders sympathetic to the cause brought Congress back for an extraordinary weekend session. Only later did it appear, based on various polls, that the majority of Americans did not see Schiavo's case the way the Republican leadership did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, the starvation of a solitary middle-class woman in Florida riveted government for a couple of weeks while similar  --  and more severe  --  situations went almost unnoticed. Mass starvation in Sudan, for instance, was a legislative footnote by comparison. Why? It's not only that Sudan is far away and hard to solve. Help for the Sudan catastrophe lacks the backing of as many obsessively focused and widely dispersed interest groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The brewing battle in the Senate over a mere seven judicial nominees is another telling example. Groups on the political left and right are making the coming confrontation seem like World War III. (Witness the use of the word ""nuclear"" to describe the Republicans' effort to force a vote.) In fact, the debate is a warm- up for the more consequential conflict over filling the next Supreme Court vacancy as well as a stand-in for other divisive issues, such as gay rights, abortion rights and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why such tumult and passion? Organizations with wide and longstanding interest have been on the prowl for supporters on these matters for years. On the anti-Bush side are the Alliance for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and People for the American Way, which was instrumental in derailing Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. The president's allies include groups such as the Committee for Justice, Focus on the Family, the Federalist Society, Americans for Tax Reform and FreedomWorks, which have not only raised millions for the purpose but coordinate their activities in conference calls among their leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an odd way, all this attention to Washington ways is heartening. The common view is that elites run the show and sheep- like citizens allow them to. In fact, organized interests able to motivate blocs of voters really can make a difference, as long as they can stick around for a while.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, not every vital issue has a group or groups that are clever or rich enough to generate unrelenting support from back home. That leaves out of the mix too many people with worthy woes: the unemployed, the uninsured, the unaligned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's probably an opportunity there for yet another powerful interest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Author's e-mail:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kstreetconfidential@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jeffrey Birnbaum is a Post reporter whose</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>K Street Confidential column on the intersection of business and politics appears on alternate Mondays in the Business section.

Pete Wilson turns 85 tomorrow, so on behalf of all Californians, I say: gracias. (That's ""thank you"" in Spanish, Pedro.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for your 30-plus years of service as a public official -- first, as an assemblyman for San Diego, then as the mayor of that city, followed by two terms apiece as our U.S. senator and governor. Your career helped shaped the modern-day Golden State.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a career mostly defined by a moderate approach -- an important lesson for the Democrats and Republicans of today that too few bother to remember.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a mayoral career that saw you protect San Diego's wetlands and implement <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> hiring practices. ""He believes that America's minorities have been handicapped for years,"" one campaign flier read, ""by inadequate housing, education and job opportunities, and he has dedicated his efforts to alleviating these problems."" That's a reality that more Republicans should acknowledge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for being so hurt when the Republican Party pulled their 1972 convention from San Diego that you responded with an ""America's Finest City"" campaign. You showed second-tier cities across the country that they too should be proud of who they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for proving that Republicans can take the lead in addressing America's prior racial wrongs. As senator, you cosponsored the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which granted reparations and an official government apology to Japanese Americans interned during World War II.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for showing us that a Republican governor could understand that raising taxes to help shore up public finances was a wise thing and not treason. In 1991, when California faced a record deficit, you backed tax increases for sales, the wealthy and even snacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias too for throwing away this record of centrism. (Just bear with me.) You showed future generations of politicians how not to ruin their legacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for helping to deregulate California's electricity, which led to mass blackouts in the beginning of the 2000s and convinced an entire generation that we shouldn't leave public utilities to the private market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for signing the state's three-strikes sentencing laws. The increase in prisoners proved that justice isn't blind but usually racist and always classist, and it planted the first seeds of distrust in law enforcement that have bloomed into a movement across the state today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for working so hard to eliminate <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> at the University of California and beyond. The program helped to get thousands of minorities into the middle class, where they promptly retreated into the comforts of whiteness. Your 180-degree turn on the issue radicalized college students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, most of all, for Proposition 187. You didn't author the 1994 measure, which declared war on immigrants in the country illegally and the people who helped them. But you jumped on the 187 bandwagon and took the reins as soon as you could to help resurrect your flagging reelection campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, Mexican Americans like me realized for the first time that a large part of society still considered us ""Mexican"" and not ""American,"" like we always believed ourselves to be. Most of us have identified with the former more than the latter ever since.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, MEChA bounced back. The Chicano high school and college group was slowly losing its power as more Mexican Americans began to identify as ""Latino"" or ""Hispanic"" and wanted no part with radical politics. Because of 187, MEChA members went on to reinvigorate the labor movement, introduce ethnic studies in high schools, and make Dia de los Muertos a thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring Latinos to enter politics like never before. And gracias for making the defense of immigrants their rallying cry. From state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra's zeal, to bringing back driver's licenses for the undocumented (which you took away), to declaring us a sanctuary state, it's all a direct response to your cynicism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring two of the most hilarious death-metal songs ever: ""Matando Gueros"" (""Killing White People"") and ""Raza Odiada"" (""Hated Race""), both by Brujeria. I certainly hope that you take their mock-assassination skit as satire at its finest, instead of a bona fide threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for providing the California Republican Party a cautionary tale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inadvertently posing for an airplane selfie two years ago with film director Alex Rivera. Your befuddled expression reminded Latinos that you're not a monster but rather just a confused fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And gracias for still not getting it. At a recent speech by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon to the Southern California Leadership Council, you complained to him that Sacramento ""ignores us,"" whatever the hell that means. (Who's ""us""?) Speaker Rendon's grace in responding to your petulance -- basically ""I'm here now"" -- was as great an example of Old and New California as Rivera could've scripted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, Governor Pedro.

I am grateful to the State Transportation Department for putting together for me an accounting of how much has been spent so far on the court-stalled Westway project and who has received the money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Transportation Department has been in charge of overseeing the 4.2-mile superhighway-waterfront development to replace the crumbled West Side Highway in lower Manhattan - a construction opus that was once estimated to cost $1.4 billion but is now projected at $4 billion or more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To date, the state agency reported, $75 million has been spent, out of $100 million authorized, on the preliminary planning and construction work - and much more is to come. The last time an accounting of this groundwork spending appeared in public print - in a story in this newspaper four years ago - the figure was only $18 million out of the $21 million allocated - so the engineers and consultants and contractors have been, so to speak, active.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ninety percent of the money has come from the Federal Highway Trust Fund and 10 percent from the state - which has led some of the promoters of the project to behave as if it will cost us next to nothing. But there is no guarantee from Congress that the rest of the project would be fully funded by this 90-10 formula; the indications, in fact, have been to the contrary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I felt it would be instructive if I reproduced here the salient portions of the Transportation Department's spending list. Because of the length of that list, I chose half a million dollars as the cutoff point; those consultants who have received less should not feel slighted at being omitted here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas and subcontractors - the main engineers for the project ... $24,833,500 System Design Concepts and subcontractors - the main consultants, who became part of the state government and directed the project until recently ... $8,671,707</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mueser, Rutledge, Johnston & DeSimone - soil engineers ...  $6,163,184</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hardesty & Hanover/Andrews & Clark (joint venture) - preliminary engineering designs ... $698,000</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ammann & Whitney - preliminary engineering designs ... $712,400 Howard, Needles, Tammen & Bergendorff - preliminary engineering designs ... $858,472 The Port Authority - monitor of a test boring and design consultant work regarding Authority facilities ... $595,625 Warren George Inc. - contractor for test borings ... $2,900,862 Clarke & Rapuano/Venturi Rauch & Scott Brown (joint venture ) - landscape architects for park design ... $995,671 R.T.P.

5e6cd7d5e1924c2888545bbb	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1022742622.xml.txt	"<div><p>Vision quest</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1933, four years after a calamitous market crash, Americans were losing hope. But then, on a cold day in March, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new president pulled no punches, laying blame for the country's financial woes squarely on Wall Street speculators -- and, by implication, on their benefactors in Washington. ""They have no vision,"" he said, citing a passage from the Bible, ""and when there is no vision, the people perish.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Roosevelt, by contrast, clearly articulated a vision that reawakened the hope of a beleaguered nation. He spoke that day of the country's greatest need -- putting people back to work -- and he laid out a plan for achieving that goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Decades later, when Americans faced a serious recession, Bill Clinton reflected on the same biblical passage when accepting the presidential nomination at the 1992 Democratic Convention. ""I hope nobody ... in our beloved country has to go through tomorrow without a vision,"" he said. ""I hope no one ever tries to raise a child without a vision. I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the ground without a vision. For where there is no vision, the people perish.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans today aren't interested in slogans and sound bites. They want the candidates to offer them a vision, but so far neither Mitt Romney nor President Obama has done so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans are recycling tired promises from the Reagan era, preaching a gospel of small government and fiscal responsibility. But their words ring hollow. Republicans have been sounding that theme for decades, but they've never put it into practice. Reagan tripled the national debt. George W. Bush nearly doubled it, and left a legacy of debt from two unfunded wars and unfunded tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a messaging strategist who has worked with office-seekers and officeholders at all levels of government, including the presidency, I have closely examined the reaction of voters to the standard Republican narrative about taking care of ""job creators"" and eliminating ""red tape that's strangling business."" The response of voters across the political spectrum is lukewarm. Americans may yet elect Romney, but it won't be because they really buy what he's selling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters aren't hearing a clear message from Obama either. On the one hand, he's pushing for more stimulus, but he is also the architect of a ""grand bargain"" that will cut more than $2 trillion from the 2013 federal budget, imposing the same kind of ""austerity"" that has proved so counterproductive in Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why hasn't either candidate offered a clear vision that resonates with the American people?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is that, in a time that requires boldness, the two presidential candidates are both cautious by nature. But there are other reasons as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is the role of money in politics. Roosevelt attacked Wall Street in his first speech as president, and backed up his rhetoric with one piece of legislation after another to limit its power. He used government money to put Americans directly to work -- something no one had dreamed of doing before -- and created Social Security, a minimum wage and unemployment insurance. In today's political culture, presidential candidates and legislators are beholden to Wall Street to support their campaigns, which has made the passage of such measures inconceivable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second reason for the paucity of vision is historical. For nearly 50 years, the Roosevelt legacy guided Democratic and Republican presidents alike. Dwight Eisenhower scoffed at the idea, proposed by his right flank, of dismantling New Deal programs, and instead expanded the role of the federal government by creating the interstate highway system. Richard Nixon greatly extended the federal government's role in protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink by creating the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came Ronald Reagan, who drew on his charisma to undo as much of what Roosevelt built as he could. He did so by sounding themes that resonated with voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One was based on a legitimate concern that once a government program was created, it developed barnacle-like constituencies that made it as difficult to dismantle as a barrier reef. A second theme was racial, with talk of Cadillac-driving ""welfare queens."" This was a continuation of Nixon's ""Southern strategy"" that served to solidify the GOP stronghold in the South. A third spoke to the aftershock of the 1960s, one of the most rapid periods of social change in history. This was a note that resonated with many Americans, particularly with white working-class males who'd been left frightened and angry by the women's movement and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, which challenged them both at home and at work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at its heart Reagan's critique was of a government that was too powerful, too large, too intrusive. What he didn't mention was that the radical deregulation that he set in motion was also making government more corrupt with every passing campaign dollar. The result was a rising tide of inequality and insecurity for ordinary Americans unseen since the Depression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, the parties and their standard-bearers continue to labor under the broken ideology of Reagan -- an ideology that led, in the hands of George W. Bush, to the Great Recession of 2008. The struggles of working- and middle-class Americans four years later reflect the failure of any leader to transcend Reagan's ideology. Romney continues to claim it as his own, while Obama hasn't offered a coherent alternative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1987, when Reagan's vice president, George H.W.

6112e667b3361fc937de0e3a	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2100741387.xml.txt	"<div><p>ANALYSIS; Senate testimony insights; Kavanaugh's Supreme Court hearing shows growing partisanship, but reveals little about his views on the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week's Senate hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh lived up to -- or perhaps down to -- expectations for how modern-day justices are confirmed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A sharp partisan divide was on display from the first minute and lasted until the bitter end. In an unprecedented move on the first day, Democrats tried to shut down the hearing by complaining that Republicans were withholding documents about Kavanaugh's record. Republicans accused Democrats of political grandstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it was all over, the highly qualified and reliably conservative judge was headed for approval in the Senate Judiciary Committee, albeit with Republican votes only.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This surely has been the most contentious hearing since [Clarence] Thomas"" in 1991, said University of Georgia law professor Lori Ringhand, who has written a history of court confirmation hearings. ""Cooperation among the committee members seems to have completely broken down.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She said the hearing continued the trend of revealing less and less about a nominee's views. ""Kavanaugh seemed to provide firm answers to even fewer substantive questions than [Justice Neil M.] Gorsuch, who provided fewer firm answers than any nominee for decades. In my opinion, this strips the process of much of its value.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Thomas confirmation in 1991 had stood alone as unusually contentious for two reasons. Thomas was a 43-year-old black conservative with a thin record when he was tapped to succeed Justice Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights legend. And after a week of hearings, the public learned that Anita Hill, a former aide, had accused him of sexual harassment. Nonetheless, Thomas won confirmation on a 52-48 vote in a Senate controlled by Democrats. He then joined a court where most of the justices had won unanimous Senate confirmation, including Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, there has been a steady decline in the number of senators who will cross party lines to confirm a high court nominee. In 1993, President Clinton's first nominee, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, won with a 96-3 vote. In 2005, President George W. Bush's first nominee, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., won on a 78-22 vote. In 2009, President Obama's first nominee, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, won on a 68-31 vote. And last year, Gorsuch, President Trump's first nominee, won by a 54-45 vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was the lone Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee to support Obama's nominees. On Thursday, he bemoaned the raucous partisanship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""People wonder,"" he said, ""are these hearings turning into a circus?"" But Graham said this was not fair nor accurate. ""Circuses are entertaining, and you can take your children to them. This hearing is neither entertaining nor appropriate for young people."" He referred to the regular shout-outs from protesters who were dragged from the hearing room.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators from both major parties often speak of their desire for a ""neutral"" judge who will simply follow the law and rule fairly without bias. But their actions tell a different story.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the Republicans joined together in 2016 to block even a hearing for a highly qualified Obama nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now all the Democrats, at least on the committee, are united in their opposition to Kavanaugh to fill the seat of the recently retired Kennedy, the high court's swing justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservative scholars credited Kavanaugh with a strong, steady performance amid the partisan squabbling. ""He is an experienced, thoughtful and intelligent mainstream judicial conservative. I do not believe we learned anything new about him, but we have learned a bit about the new normal in terms of collegiality in the Senate and the depth of activists' frustration with the administration,"" said Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Women's rights advocates and liberal scholars were not reassured by his testimony. ""Our fears about the future of this country deepened this week when Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly refused to answer questions about his views on abortion, employment discrimination, immigration and healthcare. Our civil rights, dignity and autonomy will be in grave danger if he is confirmed,"" said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, pointed to the jarring contrast between Kavanaugh's public praise for the Brown vs. Board of Education school desegregation ruling and his private White House memos deriding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies. ""Seeing him use words like 'naked racial set-aside' and 'racial spoils system' to refer to race-conscious measures intended to redress entrenched systemic racism is upsetting,"" Wydra said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump promised to appoint justices who would vote to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that established a woman's right to choose abortion, and Democrats pressed Kavanaugh to explain his views. He repeatedly said Roe was a ""precedent,"" but would not say it was correctly decided.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he described the 1974 ruling in United States vs. Nixon, which required the president to turn over the Watergate tapes, as correct and one of the great moments in the court's history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cornell law professor Michael Dorf was a clerk for Kennedy in 1992, when the court reaffirmed the right to abortion in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, and said Kavanaugh's comments did not signal he would uphold abortion rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Understood in context, he said very little,"" Dorf said, except that Roe and Casey are precedents. ""There is good reason to think that in addition to Justice Thomas, Chief Justice Roberts and Justices [Samuel A.] Alito and Gorsuch would overrule Roe if presented with the opportunity,"" he said. If so, he said, Kavanaugh could supply the fifth vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When asked about same-sex marriage, Kavanaugh took a different approach that may be significant. He spoke of a passage from Kennedy's opinion in June in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case that endorsed equal rights for gays and lesbians. Kavanaugh noted correctly that nearly all the justices, including the leading conservatives, signed the opinion, which -- as he paraphrased it -- said that ""the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans, or gay and lesbian couples, as second-class citizens or inferior in dignity or worth are over in the Supreme Court. That's a very important statement.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) had asked him to say whether the 2015 ruling in Obergefell vs. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage was correctly decided. It is a ""yes or no"" question, she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kavanaugh refused to answer, repeating his statement that a nominee should not give a ""thumbs-up or thumbs-down"" response to recent rulings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leading gay rights advocates said they were not reassured. They noted the court in the Masterpiece case ruled that the Colorado cake maker was treated unfairly based on his Christian beliefs. Sharon McGowan, a lawyer for the gay rights advocacy group Lambda Legal, said Kavanaugh's ""bobbing and weaving to avoid endorsing Obergefell speaks volumes. It signals not only to us, but also to his most fervent supporters, that he is prepared to grant religious opt-outs from nondiscrimination laws that are designed to protect LGBT people and their families.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the next year, the court is likely to take up another religious rights case, possibly from a florist in western Washington state who refused to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. The court's conservatives are likely to look favorably on her claim for a religious exemption from the state's civil rights law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is no sign the court's conservatives are interested in revisiting the issue of same-sex marriage. Abortion remains highly disputed, and several Republican-led states are likely to enact bans on abortion that will send the issue back before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, conservative lawmakers are not pressing to enact new bans on same-sex marriage, and as Kavanaugh's comment suggested, there is no reason to believe such a challenge would be welcome at the high court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>david.savage@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: BRETT KAVANAUGH takes a break Thursday from his confirmation hearing with former players of a youth basketball team he coached.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Drew Angerer Getty Images</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed		
6112e667b3361fc937de0e3a	test_question_against_testing_2	<p>TESTING THE WATERS DROPPING THE SAT WOULD MEAN FAILING STUDENTS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Got a weight problem? Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>		stance:::None/Not Discussed		
6112e667b3361fc937de0e3a	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421591042.xml.txt	"<div><p>Commentary; SAT's 'Halo Effect' Casts a Long Shadow</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The discussion emanating from the University of California regarding the SAT is an invigorating move for American higher education. It is long overdue. The SAT is ideally viewed as a yardstick of merit. It has been used for decades as a key criterion for admission to four-year colleges and universities. Yet, in reality, the SAT is a poorly defined test that reflects racial and economic privileges. It reproduces sex, race and class inequalities in access to the nation's educational resources that produce wealth and power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The SAT affords a too-easy sorting of students' applications into the categories of admit, maybe admit and don't admit. The problem is that many of the students in the don't-admit category could succeed with flying colors if they were given the chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The SAT creates a halo effect that colors the more holistic evaluation of applicants' statements of purpose and letters of recommendation. It creates a mind-set that is tough to overcome for students who don't have the ""test-wiseness"" to correctly fill the bubbles on questions that involve obscure vocabulary or reasoning that is embedded in white cultural trivia. Students might be expected to know Shakespeare or Voltaire, but they are safe if they are ignorant of Wheatley or Nkrumah. After more than 20 years of college teaching, I've learned that the single most important criterion for a student's success is his or her motivation and effort, attributes that are untapped by SAT scores.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've seen students with abysmal scores excel and students with stellar ones flounder. For millions of aspiring college students, the SAT tests students on material that they have not been taught. In the context of known racial inequalities in educational opportunity, the use of an inflexible yardstick such as the SAT is inherently racist. Ward Connerly, the regent who has led the movement to abolish <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> at UC and in the nation, suggested that he would not want the banning of the SAT to be a ""proxy"" for racial preferences. But the use of the SAT is, in fact, a proxy for maintaining the racial and economic advantages of rich whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UC President Richard H. Atkinson is correct in casting doubt on the SAT, but he is wrong in suggesting that the SAT II, a subject- matter test, is an improvement. Students are advised to take the verbal and math sections of the SAT II (and a subject area of their choosing), which re-create the same biases as the SAT I. Standardized tests cannot assess merit in the context of non- standardized educational experiences. This is also true for the tests that act as gatekeepers to the professions, the MCAT (for medicine), the LSAT (for law) and the GRE (for the social sciences and humanities).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The under-representation of minorities who face discrimination in undergraduate programs dramatically worsens in graduate schools. Much is at stake in Atkinson's proposal because of the multibillion- dollar nature of the testing and test-preparation industries. Students waste valuable time and money in preparing for exams that are irrelevant to their success or failure in higher education. Students take the tests several times in hopes of improving their scores--a cost that is prohibitive to families that do not have financial resources.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SAT scores are weak predictors of first-year college success, explaining only 10% of the variance in grades, and have virtually no bearing on subsequent success or failure. Other measures of presumed merit, such as grade-point averages, are also problematic. GPAs are inflated by advanced placement courses that may produce GPAs above 4.0. We know that students in predominantly African American and Latino schools have less access to these courses, just as they have less access to books and experienced teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a perverse irony, African American and Latino communities support public institutions that they do not benefit from in proportion to their tax dollars. Admissions procedures must eschew criteria that have known biases and incorporate those that allow students' drive and determination to manifest themselves. They should emphasize the more important qualities of critical thinking, intercultural awareness and a healthy skepticism of the so-called knowledge items contained in the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead of spending billions of dollars to exclude students, we should redirect those dollars to create more seats in more universities. At Pitzer College, students, faculty and staff have been engaged in an ongoing dialogue about the merits of the SAT. In a recent opinion study on the matter, the college's constituencies have been nearly evenly divided. Atkinson's bold proposal nudges us in the right direction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Halford H. Fairchild is a professor of psychology and black studies at Pitzer College.

6112e667b3361fc937de0e3a	aa_opeds_sample/txt/434126284.xml.txt	"<div><p>Meet The New Elite, Not Like The Old</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- They are the children of 1969 -- the year that America's most prestigious universities began aggressively recruiting blacks and Latinos to their nearly all-white campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No longer would Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Columbia be the domain of the privileged. Instead, in response to the national soul-searching prompted by the civil rights movement, America's premier colleges would try to become more representative of the population as a whole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Forty years later, America is being led, to a striking extent, by a new elite, a cohort of the best and the brightest whose advancement was formed, at least in part, by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies. From Barack and Michelle Obama (Columbia, Princeton, Harvard) to Eric Holder (Columbia) to Sonia Sotomayor (Princeton, Yale) to Valerie Jarrett (Michigan, Stanford),  the country  is now seeing, in full flower, the fruition of this wooing of  minorities to institutions that for much of the nation's history have groomed America's leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet the consequences of that change remain unresolved, as became  clear on Friday, when Mr. Obama grappled a second time with the arrest of the Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his own home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The incident, the president said, offered the potential to soothe  longstanding distrust between minorities and police officers. But it also laid bare another reality, that the children of 1969, even those who now occupy niches at the top of society, regard their status as complicated, ambiguous and vulnerable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Whether I were black or white, I think that me commenting on this and hopefully contributing to constructive -- as opposed to negative -- understandings about the issue, is part of my portfolio,"" Mr. Obama said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a reminder that Mr. Obama, in addition to being the most powerful American, is also the fulfillment of the ideals embraced by Ivy League minority recruiters in 1969. Mr. Gates entered Yale that year, as one of 96 black freshmen. Today that number seems small. But there had been only six black students just three years before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gates belonged to the first <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> wave at top universities -- a wave that continued into the 1970s and the 1980s. I was one of its beneficiaries. A black 17-year-old from Monrovia, Liberia, I was one of some 200 black freshmen at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1983.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My first roommate was a white student from Seagrove, N.C., whose SAT scores and grade-point average were higher than mine. Privately, I consoled myself that I had qualifications that she didn't: I could name the capital of every country in Africa; countries she had never heard of. I knew where the Zambezi River emptied into the Indian Ocean. None of that had been on the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every now and then I feared I was faking it, that my white classmates had something I didn't. There were things they seemed to know instinctively, that I had to look up. I remember  getting laughed at during a game of Pictionary when I couldn't come up with the word for a giant bird landing on a lawn with a baby in its mouth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My feelings of inadequacy were not unusual, said David L. Evans, the Saturn/Apollo electrical engineer hired by Harvard in 1969 to help lead its <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program. When Mr. Evans visited public high schools in Arkansas in search of promising black students, he was met with skepticism. ""Even people who didn't have any mean-spiritedness would say to the students, 'You going to be up there with the Kennedys?' "" he recalled. "" 'How do you think you can make it there?' ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was  anxiety, too, among  the originators of race-based <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs. ""The idealistic version of why these universities embraced racial <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is that they said, 'Hey, we're in the business of training elites, it would be better for America if there were a diverse elite,' "" said Nicholas Lemann,  dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and  author of ""The Big Test,"" a history of the SAT and the rise of America's meritocracy. To its architects, the minority recruitment was the next phase for universities that for years had paved the way for whites, particularly the offspring of upper-class alumni, Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The cynical version of why they did this is they said, 'We can't control this country, it's becoming too diverse, we need to socialize the brighter minorities and make them more like us.' ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, being molded into people ""more like us"" gave the children of 1969 an advantage denied most of their white counterparts. They learned to navigate within a second world. They also absorbed some of its ideas and values. And they paved the way for the next generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""We had to go through this phase of larger integration for Barack Obama to be possible,"" Mr. Gates said in an interview a few days  after his arrest. ""It would have been impossible for Barack Obama to go from a historic black school to become president, at this time. The whole point is that a broad swath of America had to be able to identify with him.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also enabled Mr. Obama to run ""the most race-blind campaign"" of any black presidential candidate, said Gwen Ifill, the PBS news reporter whose book ""The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama"" examines the rise of African-Americans in politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps. But the children of 1969 dwell in a complex world. They retain  an ethnic identity that includes its own complement of cultural, historical and psychological issues and considerations. This emerged at Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearings. And it emerged again last week, when Mr. Obama joked in the White House East Room that if he ran afoul of the police, ""I'd get shot."" In saying this, he seemed to draw on the fears of black men across the United States, including those within the new power elite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Mr. Obama seemed to be demonstrating was what Mr. Lemann of Columbia calls a ""double consciousness"" that allows the children of 1969 to flow more easily between the world which their skin color bequeathed them and the world which their college degree opened up for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same double consciousness I acquired at U.N.C., though I didn't think about it that way as a student. Sure, my white friends were learning a little more about black (and African) culture from me. But I was absorbing much more from them, since they surrounded me in such great number. At the time it seemed I had the advantage;   I would leave college having gotten much more from my interactions with my white friends than they could possibly have gotten from me. And the principal thing I learned was how to make them feel at ease around me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, of course, on those occasions when one can't. Life outside the university doesn't duplicate the conditions of university life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I can't wear my Harvard gown everywhere I go,"" Professor Gates said. ""We -- all of us in the crossover generation -- have multiple identities, and being black trumps all of those other identities.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday Mr. Obama said he hoped Mr. Gates's incident might become a ""teachable moment."" It is a daunting task for the children of 1969: finding out whether the double consciousness they honed in the Ivy League can actually get this country to listen -- and react -- to race in a different way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HELENE COOPER           Helene Cooper, a White House correspondent for The Times, is the author of ""The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Princeton: Sonia Sotomayor.

A brief summary: Hill testified that then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her by verbally sharing his enjoyment of porn films and his sexual proficiency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, yawn if you must. This was scandalous, of course, because . . . well, I'm still not certain. You see, to be scandalized, one must be deeply sensitive to the mention of anything sexual. Indeed, in this case, one needed to be scandalized for an indefinite period of time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hill's testimony came several years after she worked for Thomas at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where the alleged harassment took place. In other words, she didn't protest at the time of these conversations, which were boorish, assuming they happened as she described. Or were they merely lame attempts at humor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The context has never been clear. In any case, other options available to Hill included telling Thomas to get over himself. Or, at the very least, assuming deep offense, complaining to a higher authority. She did neither, apparently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, nothing was mentioned until Thomas was nominated to the highest court. Would an African American nominee of the liberal persuasion have been subjected to the same kind of interrogation? Only as precedent to riot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clarence Thomas's ""offense"" had nothing to do with whether he did or did not say something off-color to a subordinate. Rather, his offense was being a conservative black man who had the audacity, among other things, to suggest that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> ultimately might do harm to those it was intended to help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now we are revisiting the Thomas hearings, sadly owing to the poor judgment of his wife, Ginni. As all surely know, she recently called Anita Hill and left a voice mail suggesting that Hill apologize for what she did. This jaw-droppingly odd lapse has prompted an unwelcome and sordid review of the past and a deluge of theories to explain Ginni Thomas's action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For one, the same day of the phone call, a story ran on the front page of the New York Times about Ginni Thomas's new nonprofit group, Liberty Central, which aims to organize the Tea Party movement. She was trying to monetize the moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's put a pause on nonsense and concede that the Thomas affair remains a painful memory and maybe, just maybe, the justice's wife needs resolution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, a new player has emerged in the drama: Lillian McEwen, a former Thomas girlfriend from way back, has decided that now is the time to set the record straight. Coincidentally, McEwen is shopping her memoir.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday night, McEwen sat down with Larry King on CNN (where I work) to share her own sexual past with Thomas and her belief that Hill told the truth. She told The Washington Post (where I am a columnist) that Thomas was ""obsessed with porn.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McEwen said she didn't mind the porn, she was just bored by it. She also told King that Thomas, who quit drinking while they were together, became ambitious and obsessed with physical fitness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thomas's history of drinking is no secret to anyone who bothered to read his memoir, ""My Grandfather's Son."" He is brutally honest about his transformation from an angry boy abandoned by his alcoholic father, his upbringing by his grandfather and the nuns at his little Catholic school, and his battle with his own demons and lonely rages to become a thoughtful man deeply respected by fellow members of the court. As Supreme Court analyst Jan Greenburg wrote in ""Supreme Conflict,"" Thomas is the quiet force on the bench who brings others to change their minds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only the heartless would not be moved by Thomas's description of lying at home in a fetal curl, suffering the public humiliation of his hearing, and recognizing that the only route to survival was humility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It had long since become clear to me that this battle was at bottom spiritual, not political,"" he wrote, ""and so my attention shifted from politics to the inward reality of my spiritual life.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proud Thomas said during those hearings that he was the victim of a high-tech lynching. Let's hope he has enough spiritual reserve to survive this second lynching  --  and a big enough heart to forgive poor Ginni.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kathleenparker@washpost.com</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

Few experts in the press or academe wanted to probe this most politically incorrect topic until Louisiana's David Duke seized the issue and became a political force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>General population polls conducted by Gordon Black Associates in 1984 and by the National Opinion Research Center in 1990 suggest that 1-in-10 white men has been injured by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. This figure alone adds up to millions. Circumstantial evidence suggests even larger numbers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Preferential policies were instituted during an intensely competitive era when huge cohorts of baby boomers crowded job markets increasingly constrained by international competition, lean-and-mean downsizing movements, and tax revolts. Thus, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> often occurred in zero-sum contexts; someone was quota-ed in at another's expense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My research indicates that reverse discrimination's bite has varied by age, geography, occupation, and private or public sector. Most vulnerable have been public-sector white men under the age of 45 with people-oriented skills. Their phone calls flood radio talk-show programs on this topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many more white men may not have been fully aware that they were being injured by behind-the-scenes tactics such as ""race-norming"" of employment tests by public testing agencies, and many private ones. (The EEOC only recently stopped pressuring corporations to use such procedures.) Nor have they been told of the drive to tie managers' bonuses to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hiring and promotion records.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I became curious about the impact of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> while working in the increasingly quota-crazy higher education systems of California -- where policies moved far beyond the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke dictum that race could be considered as one of several factors in selection processes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the 1980s, a state mandate for the community college system (AB1725) ordered a 30% minority-faculty hiring ""goal"" until the year 2005 -- when faculty must mirror the ethnic diversity of the entire state; the University of California began advertising ""targets of diversity"" faculty positions and substantially boosted minority-female representation in administrative staff positions to 72%; and the California State University system implemented set-aside faculty positions, set-aside grant and fellowship programs for graduate students -- while the politically correct faculty union lobbied (successfully) for higher pay for ""underrepresented"" junior faculty. And ""parity goals"" for the entire state work force were monitored in annual reports by the State Personnel Board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As my quiet interest in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> leaked out -- a professionally dangerous development -- students, colleagues, friends and relative strangers began to report encounters with reverse discrimination. In 1984-85, two graduate assistants and I supplemented this rising tide of informal data -- and scattered press reports -- with 32 in-depth interviews with California-based, mostly middle-class white men who reported that preferential policies prevented them from obtaining jobs or disrupted or ended extant careers. Some findings:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A community college instructor repeatedly lost tenure-track appointments to less qualified minorities after he moved to California from Michigan. ""At first, you think it's you,"" he said. ""You blame yourself."" (He finally obtained an appointment at another college.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A mid-management bank administrator -- and an ardent liberal -- began to have second thoughts as he watched women he'd hired the year before move by him on the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> fast-track. (Rapid increases in female mid-management employees in his bank and at others lent credence to his account.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Public-sector workers reported that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> barriers eventually became obvious and quietly acknowledged by most employees. After 13 years of being bypassed by minorities or women, one upper-middle-management California state official reported being offered a promotion -- with some public fanfare -- only to have the appointment rescinded because, as an agency head told him, ""Let's face it, you're not the right color.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of these men avoided open complaints or protests out of fear they wouldn't be believed or would be labeled racist. (No one said he feared being thought sexist.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Six resigned from the organizations that discriminated against them. Three circumvented reverse discrimination problems through various organizational means. Three filed suits, none of which was successful. No government agency offered redress. (EEOC guidelines effectively insulate employers from reverse discrimination complaints if the employer has taken ""reasonable"" voluntary <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> to remedy ""deficiencies"" in minority representation.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of our subjects simply acquiesced in their treatment with varying degrees of bewilderment, resignation or anger. Most subjects voiced temporary, if not long-term, frustration and cynicism about social institutions. ""A lot of us were sold a bill of goods,"" complained a California state middle-management worker. ""We were told if you went to college you could write your own ticket. But . . . <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has lowered standards to the point where education counts against you.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No subject expressed hostility toward minorities per se, but many felt alienated from a society that refused to acknowledge whites' victimization. A teacher, transferred to a distant school in a racial balancing plan, commented: ""My friends couldn't handle this. They experienced cognitive dissonance. They didn't want to be seen as racists."" Another teacher noted: ""I found out what it was like to be a victim. Nobody likes a victim.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Research sponsored and then suppressed by the Democratic Party in 1985 and 1987 suggests a possible class split in white reactions to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Political analyst Stanley Greenberg's ""Report on Democratic Defections"" by blue-collar white ""Reagan Democrats"" in Michigan found fury over quotas for blacks and immigrants. (This anger, Mr. Greenberg concluded, undercut Democratic campaign themes of ""fairness"" and ""justice."") These data, in combination with the record of lawsuits filed by blue-collar groups (overtly or covertly aided by unions), indicate a more militant, angry working-class response. This is perhaps because of more intense zero-sum problems wrought by a shrinking blue-collar jobs market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until Pete Wilson, Jesse Helms and David Duke began to attack quotas in statewide election campaigns last year, a curious bipartisan paralysis thwarted any open political response to rank-and-file whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Radicals and liberals have neutralized whites' complaints with swift, categorical denials, such as ""white males can't be victims."" Indeed, much liberal and multicultural theory today embodies a colorized version of Marx's class struggle. White men (regardless of individual backgrounds) are regarded as a privileged modern-day ""bourgeoisie,"" while women and people of color (again, regardless of individual or subgroup circumstances) are the oppressed ""proletariat."" Any mention of a white working class -- once prominently represented in labor histories -- is simply met with more rationalizations or with awkward silence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives have been inclined to dismiss white men's complaints of reverse discrimination because of conservatism's rugged individualistic and free-market underpinnings. White men injured by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> are likely to be told to ""take it like a man"" and get on with their lives. Conservatives are also likely to harbor the assumption that an injured white man can simply quit the offending organization and get another job or start his own business. And there's been more than a hint of class bias. Conservatives are not overly fond of historically Democratic, unionized, white, blue-collar and public-sector workers. Some right-of-center writers have sneered at ""firefighters"" (presumably racist brethren of Archie Bunker) who complain of reverse discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stereotype of ""racist"" working-class white men has made most journalists, academics and politicians fearful of acquiring a ""racist"" label themselves if they even raise the white-male problem. Thus, most of the recent debate over <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has focused on the safer topics of costs to employers and the stigmatization of officially favored groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unwanted, inadvertent findings about whites and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have been buried. Just as the Greenberg studies were suppressed in the mid-1980s, a 1990 study by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, designed to provide impetus for the 1991 civil rights bill, was bottled up. News leaks indicated the study uncovered substantial white anger toward <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One study not buried was the recent, well-publicized Urban Institute study in which matched black/white pairs of job seekers were sent out to test discrimination in hiring. In 67% of the outcomes, neither applicant was offered a job; in 13%, both the black and white applicants were offered the job; in 15% of the cases, only the white applicant was offered the job, while in 5% of the cases the black received the offer-indicating only minimal levels of reverse discrimination. However, the institute study ignored the public sector entirely, as well as people-oriented, liberal-arts types of jobs. Would the institute be willing to dispatch black/white teams to apply for openings in California state agencies? In universities?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span>'s impact upon white males must also be viewed as a legitimate topic of discussion if we are to understand how these policies have both functioned and malfunctioned. An earlier, fair hearing of whites' complaints might have led to the recognition that, in practice, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has become what George Will has aptly termed a racial spoils system with all attendant corruptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lingering white racism is to be condemned. But it is unjust and inaccurate to automatically attribute whites' criticisms of flawed policies to racism. Further suppression will only obscure troubling realities and lead to emotional exploitation of an important topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lynch is visiting associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California, and author of ""Invisible Victims: White Males and the Crisis of Affirmative Action"" (Praeger Paperbacks, 1991).</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

Things happen. Hillsides erupt. Trends emerge. New stars are born, as old ones are escorted to the quiz shows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Change is the one constant of California life, or so sing the gilded poets. And yet at times it seems nothing ever changes at all. Like the poppies, certain plot lines keep coming back again and again, the perennials of the public scene. Like the smog, some never go away at all. Water is one obvious example.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The generals of hydraulics are at it again, warring this time over Colorado River water. The stakes, as always, are huge and the details, as always, are complex. The fundamental issue, though, is the same as always: Water, water, who gets the water? There never has been, and never will be, enough water for California--except when it floods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, the politics of the place adhere to familiar patterns. From the earliest days, California vote-seekers have campaigned against the Other. In the mid-1800s, it was ""John,"" code name for the Chinese laborers. There were the Pikes, followed by the Okies, and the Hollywood Reds, and the welfare queens, and Mexican field workers, and the beneficiaries of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Does anyone doubt that, given the mounting political ruckus over the Asian connection, the next election will be a contest to determine which candidates know the fewest Chinese?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This sense of repetition can be annoying to journalists. News is supposed to be a self-defining term, but after the 10th dog is bitten by a boy, the headlines can feel a little too familiar. Cynicism begins to invade the journalistic immune system, a dangerous development in that the truly cynical journalist is but one bad day away from a second career as press agent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All that said, it still seems not at all difficult to imagine what headlines await Californians beyond that bridge to the New Millennium. Five years from now--or 10, 15, 25, even 50 years from now--the news will be full of water wars and wedge issues and O.J. Simpson's new quarters at the rest home. B-1 Bob Dornan, or his lawful heirs, will be demanding a recount. Jerry Brown will be rumored to be contemplating a run for something, anything. Peter Ueberroth will be rumored to be a candidate for a job he doesn't want.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A seismic engineer will be expressing concern about the L.A. Coliseum press box. Tunneling for the Metro Red Line will be stalled somewhere under the city. A California councilman will be shown amid the scorched rubble of a canyon, declaring the time has come to crack down on roof shingles. A county supervisor will visit a submerged subdivision, declaring the time has come to crack down on flood plain development. Los Angeles will be fighting over its police chief.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Dodgers will need a third baseman. Al Davis will be threatening to move his Fort Worth Raiders to Frankfurt. Food critics will be predicting that Los Angeles cuisine finally is about to come of age. Sylvester Stallone will announce he is now seeking serious roles. And Liz Taylor will be home from Cedars, weakened by the operation, but holding up well for a 145-year-old. Her fiance will stand at the gate, shooing away paparazzi.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perennials can provide a sense of security. That every spring the feature writers return on schedule to San Juan Capistrano is somehow reassuring. It was comforting to read the other day in the Fresno Bee that San Joaquin Valley raisin growers are about to embark on yet another promotional campaign. Their conviction that the world is but one catchy advertisement away from succumbing to raisin mania has been a staple of reportage in raisinland since William Saroyan was a boy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some never-ending stories, however, grow tedious, as unwelcome as weeds. Tales of the latest gang to terrorize the streets, or the latest crackpot to invade the family planning clinic, or the latest measurement of public school decline--any novelty wore off sad old chestnuts such as these long ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, new crops do keep pushing up. Politicians in particular are adept at developing the fresh controversies that news requires. Currently in the state Capitol, debate rages over gambling and how to control card rooms and reservation casinos. This story line holds tremendous evergreen potential, as all sides seem willing to throw huge amounts of cash at the legislators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As long as combatants are willing to donate, politicians will be willing to debate their issue, on and on, but without conclusion.

None of that sheds any light on the most important political questions facing the nation: How will Al Gore or George W. Bush govern, once in the White House, and who will follow the winner to the center of power?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Knowing whom a President Gore or a President Bush would hire to help run the federal government ought to be high up in the minds of voters in November. After all, in addition to the president himself, the Cabinet and sub-Cabinet members, White House advisers, thousands of presidential appointees, Schedule C employees, and personal and confidential assistants scattered throughout the federal establishment will directly shape administration priorities and influence the national policy for the next four years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, with the exceptions of Gen. Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, who have been prominently mentioned as Bush's secretary of State and national security adviser respectively, voters are clueless as to who would be on George W. Bush's A-team next year. The same goes for Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters deserve to know who is to be entrusted with the machinery of government. And they should know before Election Day, not after the votes are counted, while the champagne is flowing and when names start cropping up in the news. By then, it's too late to do anything about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are good reasons for demanding that both candidates come clean sooner rather than later.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bush, for instance, staged images of inclusion in Philadelphia and produced a platform that said, ""To all Americans, particularly immigrants and minorities, we send a clear message: This is the party of freedom and progress, and it is your home."" George W. Bush now has a chance to go one step further by revealing to America what his administration would look like.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Would the people selected to help him wield power reflect the hard- right political orientation of the overwhelmingly white conventioneers who were kept offstage at the First Union Center in Philly? Or would he craft an administration that reflects the diversity his party touted in prime time and in its platform?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican standard-bearer can spend the rest of the campaign hugging black children, addressing Latino rallies in fluent Spanish and pledging help to Native Americans. But a Bush governing team that fails to look like the America he professes to embrace would confirm the Democratic charge that the GOP convention was only an illusion of inclusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Waiting until Inauguration Day to find out what Bush has in mind is a gamble. Voters need to know now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Al Gore has no less a burden. A major role reversal has occurred within the Democratic Party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Writing about the Democratic convention in the Aug. 28 New Republic, Franklin Foer correctly observed: ""Liberal lions like Jackson and [Ted] Kennedy may know how to give speeches that energize the base, but the action in the Democratic Party is well to their right, with the Democratic Leadership Council . . . and other hard- core centrists. And the centrists know it; throughout the convention, their triumphalism is palpable.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Rev. Jesse Jackson partially conceded the shift during a meeting with The Post's editorial board this week. He agreed that the privately run Democratic Leadership Council has gained firm control of the top of the Democratic presidential ticket through its chairman, Sen. Joe Lieberman, and its member, Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Jackson said the council's membership does not reflect the racial or political orientation of delegates at the Los Angeles convention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That may not matter. As Will Marshall, president of the council's think tank, the Progressive Policy Institute, boasted in the New Republic piece: ""We used to be outside taking shots [at them]. Now we're enthroned and they're constantly attacking us.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does that mean the center-right-oriented council would have greater influence over the naming of Cabinet members and other top- level positions in a Gore administration? Not an insignificant question.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most African Americans and many other voters of color are expected to go with Gore because of Bill Clinton's record on jobs, his support for civil rights and his appointment of the most diverse administration in this country's history. But now that Gore is his ""own man,"" voters may want to know if the Democratic Leadership Council's ascendancy will mean a rollback in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> or backsliding on Democratic policies aimed at strengthening cities and rural communities and closing the achievement gap in schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candidate Gore can answer their worries by putting on public view- -before Nov. 7--the key women and men with whom he plans to govern.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That said, it would be wrong to conclude that this column's push for early disclosure is only about race and diversity. It's more than that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We're in a new day. Voters are better informed; they want and need to know more. Why shouldn't they know, in advance, who would be on the next president's foreign policy team? Why can't they be in a position to judge--before they vote--the credentials and competence of the individuals who, for example, would be selected to oversee health care policy and food and drug laws, manage environmental protection, carry the burden of federal law-enforcement responsibilities and steer the executive branch through the federal budget process?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both camps will tell you that's what a presidential transition is for--that they have to develop a blueprint, recruit, vet, make people fill out forms, and meet with interest groups, etc. from November to January.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Never mind that Tony Blair and his cabinet ministers took office in England one day after his election--a 24-hour transition. Or that presidential transitions take a week in France.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Okay, I'll concede this much: The next president can't unveil his entire administration by November. But why not disclose his future cabinet by mid-October?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sure, it would spoil the fun of watching the months-long intense jockeying of wannabes seeking top jobs in the next administration. And yes, it would stop Gore and Bush, two political pros, from teasing and extracting support from the ambitious and the aspiring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I think it's time for Bush and Gore to stop showing voters a little leg; it's time for both men to show their hand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e-mail: kingc@washpost.com</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

While the Coalition for an Anti-Sexist Harvard rallied outside the science center, a hastily formed group with the laid-back name Students for Larry was milling about Lowell Lecture Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the crisis wasn't just about Larry Summers. Gendergate -- to give the scandal its obligatory suffix -- was more than a matter of an impolitic president. At stake is the university's very identity: Is Harvard liberal or conservative?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one associated with the university, of course, would ever admit to thinking about it that way. How could such basic terms fit, given Harvard's image of itself as an institution that celebrates independence of beliefs and political affiliations as the essence of its charter? And not without justification: It can tenure Harvey Mansfield, the professor of government famous for his politically incorrect pronouncements, and Hilary Putnam, the philosophy professor who was handing out Progressive Labor pamphlets 35 years ago and seems not to have changed his mind on any issue since?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet why should we expect Harvard, and Harvard alone, to rise above the fray? Every issue on campus, just like every issue on every other campus, is refracted through the lens of left-right politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The number of tenured women professors there? Shockingly low, and it must be fixed by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, liberals insist. The result of fewer women getting on tenure track early in their careers, conservatives retort.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expansion of the campus to Allston? An imperial land grab, the liberals say, that ignores the needs of the surrounding community. A way to create a vibrant Silicon Valley on the Charles, conservatives argue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this way, the conflagration at Harvard simply mirrors the other wars happening elsewhere -- most recently at Hamilton College, which became embroiled in a debate over a University of Colorado professor's right to call the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks ''little Eichmanns.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harvard being Harvard, any debate it provokes is certain to draw widespread attention. But there is also this crucial difference: the conservative agitator is not an outsider, but an insider. In this case, the president himself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not that Mr. Summers thinks of himself as a conservative. He was Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and before that, chief economist of the World Bank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's made Mr. Summers so controversial, said Nicholas Lemann, a Harvard graduate and now the dean of Columbia University's journalism school, is that he's conservative ''not in his politics, but in the context of the university.'' ''Just about everything he's done that's gotten attention is about a tug to the center,'' Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is to say, he would like to see R.O.T.C., which was banished from Harvard during the sit-ins of the 60's, restored to campus; he would like to overhaul the core curriculum; he would like to hire who he pleases, regardless of race or sex.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By being naturally and deliberately provocative, he has challenged campus liberals, which is not what campus liberals are accustomed to. Neil Rudenstine, the previous president, was a former English major devoted to inclusivity. Derek Bok, who preceded Mr. Rudenstine, was an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> proponent, even writing a book after he left office on the merits of race-based preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, Mr. Summers has had a series of widely reported confrontations: He rebuked Cornel West, a distinguished professor in the African-American studies department, who promptly decamped to Princeton; he made the suggestion, provoked by a pro-Palestinian faction demanding that Harvard divest itself of stock in companies allied with Israel, that campus anti-Semitism was on the rise; he deplored rampant grade inflation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The right attributed his problems to ''feminists'' furthering their ''career agendas,'' as Professor Mansfield put it: ''That he's not in favor of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, that's what this whole thing is about.'' The left complained that he was a dictatorial bully.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the considerable endowment -- now about $23 billion -- is subject to a left-right critique. Liberals want to know why more of that money isn't used for scholarships and faculty research. And why, they ask, are top money managers earning Wall Street-size bonuses? Critics of what some refer to as ''the corporatization of Harvard'' point to the university's acquisition of significant real estate holdings in Allston as symptomatic of the trend. For decades now, Harvard has been buying land across the river from the main campus, and now owns 260 acres there, leaving the university open to the charge that it has pursued a policy of expansion out of sheer acquisitiveness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Harvard started out as a public school,'' notes Lani Guinier, a Harvard law professor and the author of a forthcoming book titled ''Meritocracy Incorporated.'' ''It was given land by the state of Massachusetts. Harvard was a proprietor of Cambridge, charged with the responsibility of answering to the needs of the community. It's one thing to be the wealthiest landowner in the community, but you have to be responsible.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some extent, the campus rift is not about politics, but about a wrenching of power from the faculty. When Mr. Summers was appointed in 2001, he had, or believed he had, a mandate to make the university more efficient by exerting his control over it. ''He's interested in everything,'' says Kim Clark, dean of the Harvard Business School. ''How it runs its real estate operation, how it manages its food service, how it allocates resources.'' (''Academic freedom is wonderful,'' Mr. Summers has said, ''but it doesn't really have a place in the purchase of cement.'')</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not as if the travails of Lawrence Summers pose any threat to the continuance of the university. Harvard has weathered turbulence before in its 370-year history. Not even the travails of a president who seems to lack a superego can match the drama of that dawn in the spring of 1969 when President Nathan Pusey called in state troopers to oust students who had occupied University Hall; no one present will ever forget the cloud of tear gas wafting over Harvard Yard at five o'clock in the morning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the issues the university faces -- the fate of the new Allston campus, the overhaul of the curriculum, the proper use of the endowment -- are hardly minor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real question isn't whether Mr. Summers should stay or go, but how these inevitable transformations will play out over the next few years. Like it or not, the university over which he presides has been swept into this decade's culture war. There are some things from which not even Harvard is exempt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Drawing by Adam Palmer)</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

It seemed to echo the 1960s song that asked the same question about war. But it turned the era's rhetoric against itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I read the first paragraph, I was ready to give that little whippersnapper a history lesson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""As an above-average Latino student in a predominantly Caucasian school, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is a program that would benefit me greatly,"" wrote Miguel, 17. ""As a human being, though, I feel it should be abolished.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's galling. My own flesh and blood calling for an end to a program I advocated when I was about his age. When I enrolled at UC Berkeley, there were only a handful of minorities at the prestigious campus. As human beings, we felt justified in trying to shatter the ivory tower of privilege supported at public expense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, where have all the fighters gone?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A quarter-century later, Miguel was ready to trash a hard-won solution that had clearly worked. He called it unfair. Outdated. Reverse racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I felt the urge to confront him, but I didn't. I paused, and reconsidered my knee-jerk defense of the program voters had already eliminated. I realized Miguel was right on one score: It would be unfair for him to get a break for his race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miguel had the background and benefits he needed to succeed on his own. Both his parents are UC graduates and bilingual. His public school ranked in the nation's top 100 academically. And he wanted for nothing at home. He had his own room with his own computer and even a loft with a spiral staircase.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hardly a hard-luck case. Clearly, if he didn't make the grade, he'd have only himself to blame. Still, I couldn't agree with his conclusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why kill a program designed to compensate for social disadvantages just because you don't suffer any?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about his less privileged peers? The students from poor areas who have to work to survive. Who sleep on couches and study in closets because their homes are so crowded. Whose parents don't speak English and don't have even high school diplomas. Whose schools are short on textbooks and good teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> once pried open opportunities in an era when politicians stood in schoolhouse doors to keep minorities out. The goal was to integrate institutions that helped perpetuate racial disparities outside their ivy-covered walls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, disparities are still stark, but we can be more selective. We can target students who really need help. Just consider the list of high schools that send the most and the fewest students to UC.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, admission and affluence are correlated. Just as race and affluence are. Communities at the top of the admissions list: Palos Verdes, Irvine, Palo Alto. Those near the bottom: Santa Ana, Compton and East San Jose, where I grew up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These underrepresented areas will be the ones to benefit most under the new plan that broadens UC eligibility to all students who rank in the top 4% of their high schools. The modest plan doesn't guarantee they'll be admitted. It simply helps identify rural and inner-city students in junior year who should be aspiring to UC, says Manuel Gomez, a UC Irvine vice chancellor and my old college friend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university already knows an extra push can make the difference in a district like Santa Ana, which is only 3% white. A UC Irvine outreach program this year helped 23 Valley High School students boost their SAT scores by an average of almost 100 points, including one kid who soared 270 points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The students paid $35 for the Kaplan Review, a $700 prep course. And even that nominal fee was refunded for those with perfect attendance on weekends and after school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the kids got their money back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm told the university already considers social factors in accepting students. Success in the face of adversity counts extra. That's not a race-based policy. It's just that some races see more adversity than others. That's reality-based.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Students who achieve highly within their own set of circumstances ought to be acknowledged and rewarded for it,"" said Bob Laird, director of undergraduate admissions at my alma mater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even my son saw the light after we had a talk. In his final draft, Miguel reconsidered his <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> ban in light of ""the quietly segregated ways of the United States.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His final recommendation: ""Give equal opportunity to everybody who tries hard and a chance for success to all who pursue it.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's my boy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Agustin Gurza's column appears Tuesday and Saturday.

607295300f59b34c26ccac31	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2417314051.xml.txt	"<div><p>Op-Ed: Why California needs affirmative action more than ever</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In November, a new generation of California voters will have the opportunity to restore <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in the state. Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 will be on the ballot, giving voters the chance to repeal Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education in 1996, nearly a quarter of a century ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hail ACA 5 as a way to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic and gender inequalities, while opponents decry it as a form of categorical discrimination that privileges race and gender over merit. One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This view is wrong — the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard’s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard’s tenured professors are white — 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the “Chinese virus” and most recently “kung flu.” Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It’s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never “leveled the playing field,” but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
607295300f59b34c26ccac31	aa_opeds_sample/txt/307918907.xml.txt	"<div><p>`Goals' vs. `Quotas' at The Post</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Washington Post recently has been in a tizzy. Knots of journalists could be seen in animated conversation in the newsroom. ""What do you think?"" one would ask, and then a heated discussion would follow. Were they talking about the Unabomber and the decision of The Post to publish his modest tome? No. The hot subject was a published criticism of The Post's <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The venue was the New Republic, and the author was Ruth Shalit. Not only did she find ""racial strife"" at The Post but she accused the paper of so slavishly adhering to its <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> goals that it had lowered its standards in both hiring and news coverage. At The Post, she alleged, the best man does not always win -- an assertion that does not conform with what I know. Shalit has that part wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The editor of The Post, Leonard Downie Jr., vividly said as much. ""False,"" ""amateurish,"" ""shameful,"" ""racial McCarthyism"" and ""big-lie propaganda"" are some of the words he used. The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham, was equally exercised, and noted that the New Republic ""has never had a full-time black staffer."" He suggested a motto for the magazine: ""Looking for a qualified black since 1914."" In the areas of hiring standards and news coverage, The Post's response was so detailed as to be convincing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, it was deviously clever of Shalit to choose The Washington Post to write about what, in effect, was <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. After all, The Post is a liberal institution -- and I am not talking about its editorial positions (not all that liberal) or its supposed political line (nonexistent).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I am talking, instead, of its benevolent corporate culture. Firings are rare, layoffs nonexistent. Its journalists are relatively well paid, and they work for an organization about which they feel immense pride. I mean, the Unabomber didn't pick any ol' rag to blackmail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even here <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has produced ""racial strife."" The Post's announced goal is to have minorities make up 25 percent of its new hires and women 50 percent. To that end, it has established an operation within the newsroom that, among other things, is responsible for recruiting minorities and women. The Post is adamant that its goals not be perceived as quotas, and, as with Ford, quality remains job one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, to a white male a message has been sent. He feels himself operating under a quota system, and no amount of assurance that goals are not quotas is going to ameliorate the emotional impact. Somehow, a goal feels like a quota, and a quota feels unfair. The Post insists its standards have not been lowered. Okay. But for white males, a barrier appears to have been raised.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Washington Post-New Republic dustup may seem a parody of inside-the-Beltway nonsense, but the issues raised are hardly parochial. The newspaper business is similar to many others -- it's contracting. Newspapers are folding or merging. Even apparently thriving ones conduct themselves as if bankruptcy is just around the corner, laying off employees, killing certain editions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of America is like that. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span>, conceived in an era when economic growth seemed an American birthright, has become a lot harder to sell in a time of economic insecurity. Under those circumstances, it gets a lot harder to accept a program whose central premise -- that race (or sex) ought to be taken into account in hiring or promotion -- runs counter to the American creed. What once seemed worth trying (despite some reservations) is now seen as downright threatening.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond what <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has come to mean to many whites, it is hardly an unalloyed boon to blacks. No doubt, it has done some good. When Colin Powell proclaims himself an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> baby, we are all obligated to pay attention to what he's saying. But attention also should be paid to the pained reaction of black journalists to the New Republic piece. Using unattributed quotes, it charged that some incompetent people had been hired simply on account of race. If such people exist, I don't know them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I admire what The Post is attempting -- and anyway, I can't imagine a newspaper without a diversified staff. I know the paper's managers and their deep commitment to racial justice -- to whites as well as nonwhites. But this utilization of ethnic, racial and sexual categories in hiring inevitably sets one group against another. The standard for success is not in reaching a certain percentage but in turning out a better newspaper. Numerical goals, while understandable, ought to be replaced by only one: absolute nondiscrimination.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

Al ""The Mushroom"" Grzyb picked up his own phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a small miracle because the call lasted only 20 seconds. But that was long enough for him to explain that he didn't know anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't know anything about the Duffs and Waste Management and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And he didn't have any opinion on how the tough pink guys got $100 million in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> contracts through Mayor Richard Daley's administration. That's odd, since he was Daley's purchasing agent for 11 years, and he was the political firing pin on just about every political deal benefiting Daley's cronies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Just so you know, if there's anything you have, I haven't read anything about it,"" Grzyb said nervously.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I knew it! That's big news right there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb is obviously a loyal Sun-Times reader. They buried the Duff story Tuesday. Perhaps they didn't have a new logo they could use to claim it as their own--say a photo of the Duffs drinking with Daley at their legendary Como Inn Christmas parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And TV isn't interested in the Duff story much, either. The news broke Monday afternoon as federal prosecutors released court documents outlining their case against the Duffs. A TV reporter who has said publicly that he's not afraid of angering Daley explained why TV isn't interested. He'd like to do the Duff story, really, but there are no ""visuals.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he meant is that there are no cars in it, or trucks, things that go ""vrrooom"" with lights flashing and so on in the file tape. That's TV news for you. There's not much video excitement in a contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I thought that $100 million to white guys with Outfit connections who allegedly pretend to be minorities--and convinced their buddy Rich Daley of it too--is an interesting story, especially with the Duff federal fraud trial weeks away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I'm not with the city anymore,"" Grzyb said, as if we didn't know, since we called him at Elzie Higginbottom's business office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom's company, East Lake Management, ran that building at 69 W. Washington St., where six people died after being trapped in a stairwell with locked doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom is a Daley guy, and Grzyb needed a soft place to land after he got too hot for City Hall. It's nice to know that Higginbottom's office can protect at least one person from heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb, whose name means ""mushroom"" in Polish, was asked about the Duff-Waste Management-Blue Bag deal that the U.S. attorney's office outlined in federal court filings this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my reading of the documents, here's how it played out: A City Hall underling figured out that the Duffs were not minorities, then had the audacity to deny their minority certification on the Blue Bag contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sensing a grave injustice by being denied an opportunity to become minorities, one of the Duffs discussed this blatant discrimination with a top trucking boss and a Waste Management official and a ""City Official A.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon, Troy Ratliff, a deputy of Grzyb's, overruled the underlings. Grzyb approved the Duff contract for workers to sort out recyclable garbage for Waste Management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I don't really have any opinions on it,"" Grzyb said. ""I don't work for the city anymore. If you have any questions, call the city's press office.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb has been at the center of other deals for Daley. And he was never brought before the Chicago City Council for confirmation, because he didn't have the proper credentials under the State Purchasing Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he had the one credential that counts. He knew how to say yes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grzyb? Who was the Waste Management official you met with on the Duff deal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I don't really have any comment,"" Grzyb said. ""That's it. Thank you.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mushroom then hung up the phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He wasn't the only non-chatty type Tuesday.

607295300f59b34c26ccac31	test_question_neutral_testing_2	<p>Talking About Race in Akron</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid discussions about race are difficult even in intimate settings among well-acquainted people. For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>			stance:::In Favor/Supports

Or perhaps I've slipped into another dimension where perceptions are altered, where lies are truth, where yes means no, or the meaning of ""is"" is debatable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last Wednesday was one of those days. I was reading a New York Times columnist's accounting of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' speech at the American Enterprise Institute's dinner honoring him, and I wondered whether someone had spiked my water with some reality-altering chemical at my table.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the reliably witty Maureen Dowd described Thomas' speech as ""bellicose,"" ""self-pitying"" and ""self-aggrandizing,"" I described the same speech to friends as inspiring. Maybe it was the stirring rendition of ""America the Beautiful"" (I'm a shameless sucker for patriotic songs.), but I seem to have heard a different speech altogether.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is true, as Dowd pointed out, that the 1,600-person crowd was mostly white; that red meat was served and, presumably, eaten; that Thomas talked and talked and talked. But it is also true that no one stirred or so much as cleared his throat during the hour-long speech. And true, too, that Thomas' standing ovation at the end was longer than is required by politeness and more spontaneous than one might naturally expect of a crowd merely tired of sitting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From which I must infer that others in the throng heard the message of ""duty, honor, country"" as I did--as values worthy of the trenches and of our occasional discomfort. Nothing he said evoked ""comparisons to Bill Clinton's defense for pardoning Marc Rich when he said it was easy to say no and took courage to say yes,"" as Dowd wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It doesn't take courage to pardon an unscrupulous criminal in exchange for political favors and possibly huge sums of money, though corruption helps. It does take courage, on the other hand, to fight for your principles, to stand by your convictions, to tell the truth in your heart, as Thomas recommended throughout his speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's what Thomas really talked about, even as he acknowledged some personal understanding of these matters. He mentioned having experienced the firing line, from his Supreme Court confirmation hearings through media portrayals that were painful. He spoke, too, of his experiences as a black man who dares to question such ""black"" issues as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, school busing and welfare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Those who come to engage in debates of consequence, and who challenge accepted wisdom, should expect to be treated badly,"" he said. On issues of race, ""there was no real debate or honest discussion. When whites questioned the conventional wisdom on these issues, it was considered bad form; when blacks did so, it was treason.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Honest people know these words to be true, yet some would revile Thomas for saying them. Knowing that in advance--understanding that contradictory words will be greeted with personal attack and saying them anyway--requires the sort of courage Thomas was trying to advance that night and which surely he had to muster in order to make that speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As he made clear without bellicosity, it takes courage to participate in active citizenship. It takes courage to face down jeering crowds because you invite debate. It takes courage not to be cowed into the silence of self-censorship when brutes resort to in- your-face intimidation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one knows this better than Thomas, a black man who managed to navigate two American cultures, both black and white, in his odyssey from Pin Point, Ga., to the U.S. Supreme Court. That sort of journey takes courage. And though Thomas never said so, it also takes guts, which this man has to spare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kathleen Parker is a syndicated columnist based in South Carolina.

""They have a culture that seems not to encourage achievement. Failure is not looked upon with disgrace.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Talk about pushing buttons. Politicians who roam the halls of the nearby state Capitol went ballistic. ""This is not the kind of academic riffraff that our taxpayers should be supporting,"" argued an African-American state senator from Dallas. A Hispanic colleague of his wrote University of Texas Chancellor William Cunningham to argue that Graglia's remarks ""amount to cultural character assassination"" and should not ""be protected by academic freedom.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reactionary students who also value political correctness more than open debate called for Graglia's dismissal. And knees wobbling, even the law school faculty disassociated itself from their colleague's remarks. Some genuflected in the direction of free speech, to be sure, but the emphasis was on disagreeing with Graglia without actually pinpointing why.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And therein lies an important point: Today, Americans who are supposed to be the stewards of our political and academic traditions are still debating whether there should be free speech, rather than accepting that right as a given and using it as a tool for seriously addressing the major public policy questions of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In truth, Graglia's concern about the underachievement of minorities at ""selective institutions"" was not unfounded. Hispanics and blacks are not doing as well as mainstream students, a point made long ago by Hoover Institution senior fellow Thomas Sowell, who is black. Likewise, scholars have noted that certain Asian-American groups appear to have a culture that does produce high academic achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Graglia has a right to oppose <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, which was the real object of his opinions. But where he erred was in leaving room for the interpretation that minority underachievement is inescapable because minorities are by definition underachievers. Leaving aside the issue of tautologies, isn't it likely that disparate socioeconomic circumstances might be a relevant factor? Doesn't the disproportionate convergence of race and poverty have a bearing on minority achievement in America today? Isn't chronic low-skill immigration in states such as Texas to be considered as a factor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Graglia may wish to recall American history. During the third great wave of immigration to the United States earlier in this century, low-skill immigrants from places like rural Italy came in for an enormous amount of prejudice and discrimination because it was assumed that being poor and uneducated they could not improve themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over time, however, a number of factors came together to catapult millions of Italian-Americans into the mainstream. They became mayors, governors, Cabinet members and federal judges. Is it just possible that Graglia might soften his views toward Hispanics against such a backdrop? Is it possible that he might consider that racism and other factors have played a disproportionate role in keeping blacks down?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was having lunch in Santa Monica, Calif., the other day after a panel discussion on immigration, race and education, when I heard an articulate person at my table say that bigots needed to be shown up for what they are, or else they may be taken seriously. There is some truth in that, but it also seems to me that people who can't identify a bigot on their own or who are prone to allege bigotry where none exists are nearly as dangerous as the bigot. That is precisely why the country is more in need of education through dialogue rather than exhortation, peroration or condemnation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of all people, President Clinton needs to be reminded that such a dialogue must take in a variety of points of view. But on issues of race, don't look for nuance from Clinton. ""Those kinds of remarks don't go down well with the president, period,"" said White House press secretary Mike McCurry in condemning Graglia's opinions out of hand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, Graglia hurt a lot of people's feelings in how he said what he said. In ignoring America's past and overlooking the redemptive promise this country has held out to groups that have triumphed over time after having started at the bottom, the truth about impoverished minorities and their potential has eluded him. Even so, he deserves tolerance from a society willing to engage in a complicated discussion where hurt feelings are inevitable.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

The only question was, Why?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia, a self-described ''far right'' law professor at the University of Texas, was attending the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala at what could only be called a triumphal moment. The Federalist Society, a group of conservative lawyers and academics, has emerged from obscurity to become perhaps the most powerful force in the law today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over four days of panels and soirees, the Federalists were the toast of official Washington. Members of the Bush cabinet, including Attorney General John Ashcroft, joined in the festivities. And Justice Antonin Scalia mused to a packed banquet hall, ''Who would have thought 20 years ago that that little organization of students at a couple of law schools would have evolved today to a power of such proportions?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the legal panels, administration officials fell over themselves to say what the crowd wanted to hear. At a business-law panel, a top Justice Department lawyer talked about settling the Microsoft antitrust case, a move applauded by conservatives, who saw the suit as Clinton-era interference with the prerogatives of big business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But to Mr. Graglia, the administration's business-friendly line sounded like so much liberal claptrap. During the question period, he demanded to know why the administration was bothering to enforce antitrust laws at all. ''It really is time to be bold,'' he insisted. ''The boldest thing to do would be to repeal all the laws.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia wasn't the only conservative who was suffering. A woman stood up to declare herself ''dissatisfied and frustrated'' because the panel had not attacked the states for suing tobacco companies. A law professor fulminated against state attorneys general, like Eliot Spitzer of New York, who, by crusading to clean up the Enrons and WorldComs of the world, have become self-appointed securities commissioners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I must admit that when I headed down to Washington last week, I was expecting to encounter a good deal of gloating. The last time I spent any time with the Federalist Society crowd was on the Harvard Law Review, where a claque of right-leaning law students used to hang out late into the evening, grumbling about <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and the New Deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now this same crowd is setting the nation's legal policy and selecting its judges -- with a freer hand than ever since the Republicans retook the Senate. They are using their informal network to place conservative true believers in influential positions throughout the federal government, from Supreme Court clerkships to top agency posts. In fact, one of the late-night Harvard Law Review grumblers from way back when, Miguel Estrada, is now a Federalist Society favorite for the next vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the Federalists' remarkable good fortune, I had expected the banter to be heavy with congratulations and plans for the future. But much of the rumbling in the hallways was of grudges' being lovingly nursed and of potshots' being fired against liberal enemies long ago vanquished.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before one event, a graybeard in the audience tutored a wet-behind-the-ears Federalist on the horrors of Travelgate, in which the Clinton White House did -- well, nothing much, really. At the black-tie banquet, a satirical song took aim at ''Brennan, Marx and Lenin.'' William Brennan, the Supreme Court justice who was being gleefully branded a communist, died in 1997.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The search for fictive liberal enemies reached a loopy low on the convention's last day, when an archconservative federal appeals court judge, Laurence Silberman, accused William Rehnquist's archconservative Supreme Court of having a secret plan to declare the death penalty unconstitutional. In an opinion just last month, the court reiterated its view that capital punishment is constitutional even for 16-year-olds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the event that most captured the spirit of the week was Kenneth Starr's speech and his introduction by Barbara Comstock, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Public Affairs. Between them, Ms. Comstock and Mr. Starr managed to rail against Bill Clinton, James Carville, Lanny Davis, James Jeffords, Alan Dershowitz, the Warren court, trial lawyers and Barbra Streisand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Starr was particularly exercised about liberals' being result-oriented, abandoning their principles to reach the outcomes they favor. But he would have made a more compelling case if he had not proceeded to abandon his -- and the Federalist Society's -- own oft-repeated commitment to judicial restraint to praise the Supreme Court for striking down the Gun-Free School Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act in a burst of conservative activism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was the take-away, as meeting planners like to say, from the Federalist Society's big convention? First, if these are the folks choosing federal judges for the Bush administration -- and they are -- Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans need to be vigilant about investigating nominees' backgrounds, and using the filibuster, to prevent a far-right takeover of the courts. Second, Democrats and moderate Republicans in both houses will need to stand up for mainstream principles that are now under assault, like antitrust law and health and safety regulations. And finally, a point of sportsmanship: the only thing less appealing than a sore loser is a sore winner.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

With a title like that, need I bother to mention that the author is a conservative?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As such, he focuses on the cliches that trouble him most, and they happen to be those that he has heard uttered by liberals. That's sort of like reading Playboy for the articles; it's interesting, but something important is missing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do agree that some cliches like ""violence never settles anything"" need to go, at least until we find a good substitute for the word ""never."" In fact, history offers many examples of violence settling things, although not always in ways that were expected by its initiators. Vietnam, Iraq and the secession of the Confederacy come immediately to mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the more of Goldberg's book I read, the more appreciation I feel for the pithy power of the bumper-sticker truisms he ridicules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I like, for example, the old chestnut, ""Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer."" Goldberg responds, ""So you won't mind if those 10 guilty men move next door to you?"" Sure, but why blame the innocent guy for the 10 guilty guys next door? I would blame our criminal justice system for its failure to do what taxpayers pay them to do: Protect not only our lives and property but also our constitutional rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This barroom argument would not annoy me as much if there were not 289 exonerations of convicted individuals thanks to DNA evidence since 1989, according to the Innocence Project. The DNA era confirms some of our worst fears: We're getting the worst of both worlds; innocents are suffering while the guilty go free. And Goldberg gets to joke about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The author doesn't like ""Diversity is strength,"" either. (""Cool,"" he writes. ""The NBA should have a quota for midgets and one-legged point guards!"") Yet without getting into the deep weeds of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> debates, this country has prospered as a result of its mulligan stew of ethnics -- its Pages and Goldbergs, etc., etc. -- and our ability, more often than not, to work together with a sense of common purpose despite our differences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And surely Goldberg is not serious in his potshots at this old gem: ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Sure, he writes, ""if the other man is an idiot."" But, so what? An idiot can kill you just as dead as a sane man can. And even the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was viewed as a terrorist by those whose segregated way of life he set out to upset.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I would argue that one person's cliche is another person's wisdom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To illustrate and offer a bit of balance to what Goldberg has initiated, here are a few of the most annoying cliches, in my view, that I often hear from the political right:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""We don't solve problems by throwing money at them."" Sure. But you don't solve many problems by sucking money out of them either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Poor people need to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps."" Easier said than done, my friend. I tried to pull myself up by my own bootstraps and almost tumbled over on my head.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Keep the government's hands off of my Medicare."" Not easy. You'll have better luck with your bootstraps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Liberals love free speech as long as it supports the left."" Unlike conservatives, who love free speech as long as it does not come from the Quran or the Dixie Chicks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""America: Love It Or Leave It."" Funny, but I haven't heard that one much since President Barack Obama's election. Can we bring it back?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Why are all the news media slanted to the left -- except Fox News?"" Maybe Stephen Colbert got it right. He said, ""Reality has a liberal bias.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was a joke. It's not a cliche, yet.

One whose ranks and command structure are dominated by non-Hispanic whites? Or one whose makeup roughly reflects that of the entire city?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Richard Daley's administration has announced a strategy to achieve something close to the latter. For this he should be applauded. Instead, he is being lambasted, seemingly from every quarter--though mainly by factions placing their own self-interest above the common good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley has said the next round of promotions to the rank of sergeant will not be based solely on the results of a written test. (The last time that was done, only five minorities placed among the 114 highest-scoring promotees.) Instead, 70 percent of next year's new sergeants will be chosen solely on test results, while another 30 percent will be selected on the basis of job performance. Presumably the latter will be chosen with an eye toward racial and ethnic balance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Police union bosses, apparently content to see a mostly white police force patrol a mostly black and Hispanic city, screamed immediately that Daley wants to bring back old-fashioned political cronyism to the promotion process. That's a cheap shot. It is also, however, fair warning to the mayor that the so-called ""merit"" promotees had better not be sponsored by his pals or by ward committeemen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaders of the African-American Police League, meanwhile, said they were ""insulted"" that the mayor thinks special measures are needed to qualify more black sergeants. They claim the written test--which deals mainly with laws and procedures a sergeant ought to know--is racially biased, even though expert after independent expert has said it is fair. (Perhaps the AAPL is unaware that there have been some problems here with the public schools.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, actual performance would be a welcome criterion even without the racial undertow. No written test can predict how effective an officer will be in defusing an ugly domestic dispute or differentiating at a glance between a drug lookout and somebody waiting for a bus. That requires common sense, compassion and knowledge of the community--none of which are ascertained best by multiple-choice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's uncertain whether Daley's plan will survive the inevitable judicial review. Appellate courts have been leaning against race-based admission and promotion systems, although a wise jurist ought to be able to differentiate between <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> quotas and a diverse city's need to develop an effective police force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Daley's solution isn't perfect. Job performance ought to figure into all promotions, not just 30 percent. And if this more subjective criterion is abused, as some predict, Chicagoans will know whom to blame. For now, the mayor's plan deserves support.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

But then, on a cold day in March, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new president pulled no punches, laying blame for the country's financial woes squarely on Wall Street speculators -- and, by implication, on their benefactors in Washington. ""They have no vision,"" he said, citing a passage from the Bible, ""and when there is no vision, the people perish.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Roosevelt, by contrast, clearly articulated a vision that reawakened the hope of a beleaguered nation. He spoke that day of the country's greatest need -- putting people back to work -- and he laid out a plan for achieving that goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Decades later, when Americans faced a serious recession, Bill Clinton reflected on the same biblical passage when accepting the presidential nomination at the 1992 Democratic Convention. ""I hope nobody ... in our beloved country has to go through tomorrow without a vision,"" he said. ""I hope no one ever tries to raise a child without a vision. I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the ground without a vision. For where there is no vision, the people perish.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans today aren't interested in slogans and sound bites. They want the candidates to offer them a vision, but so far neither Mitt Romney nor President Obama has done so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans are recycling tired promises from the Reagan era, preaching a gospel of small government and fiscal responsibility. But their words ring hollow. Republicans have been sounding that theme for decades, but they've never put it into practice. Reagan tripled the national debt. George W. Bush nearly doubled it, and left a legacy of debt from two unfunded wars and unfunded tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a messaging strategist who has worked with office-seekers and officeholders at all levels of government, including the presidency, I have closely examined the reaction of voters to the standard Republican narrative about taking care of ""job creators"" and eliminating ""red tape that's strangling business."" The response of voters across the political spectrum is lukewarm. Americans may yet elect Romney, but it won't be because they really buy what he's selling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters aren't hearing a clear message from Obama either. On the one hand, he's pushing for more stimulus, but he is also the architect of a ""grand bargain"" that will cut more than $2 trillion from the 2013 federal budget, imposing the same kind of ""austerity"" that has proved so counterproductive in Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why hasn't either candidate offered a clear vision that resonates with the American people?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is that, in a time that requires boldness, the two presidential candidates are both cautious by nature. But there are other reasons as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is the role of money in politics. Roosevelt attacked Wall Street in his first speech as president, and backed up his rhetoric with one piece of legislation after another to limit its power. He used government money to put Americans directly to work -- something no one had dreamed of doing before -- and created Social Security, a minimum wage and unemployment insurance. In today's political culture, presidential candidates and legislators are beholden to Wall Street to support their campaigns, which has made the passage of such measures inconceivable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second reason for the paucity of vision is historical. For nearly 50 years, the Roosevelt legacy guided Democratic and Republican presidents alike. Dwight Eisenhower scoffed at the idea, proposed by his right flank, of dismantling New Deal programs, and instead expanded the role of the federal government by creating the interstate highway system. Richard Nixon greatly extended the federal government's role in protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink by creating the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came Ronald Reagan, who drew on his charisma to undo as much of what Roosevelt built as he could. He did so by sounding themes that resonated with voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One was based on a legitimate concern that once a government program was created, it developed barnacle-like constituencies that made it as difficult to dismantle as a barrier reef. A second theme was racial, with talk of Cadillac-driving ""welfare queens."" This was a continuation of Nixon's ""Southern strategy"" that served to solidify the GOP stronghold in the South. A third spoke to the aftershock of the 1960s, one of the most rapid periods of social change in history. This was a note that resonated with many Americans, particularly with white working-class males who'd been left frightened and angry by the women's movement and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, which challenged them both at home and at work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at its heart Reagan's critique was of a government that was too powerful, too large, too intrusive. What he didn't mention was that the radical deregulation that he set in motion was also making government more corrupt with every passing campaign dollar. The result was a rising tide of inequality and insecurity for ordinary Americans unseen since the Depression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, the parties and their standard-bearers continue to labor under the broken ideology of Reagan -- an ideology that led, in the hands of George W. Bush, to the Great Recession of 2008. The struggles of working- and middle-class Americans four years later reflect the failure of any leader to transcend Reagan's ideology. Romney continues to claim it as his own, while Obama hasn't offered a coherent alternative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1987, when Reagan's vice president, George H.W. Bush, was considering a run for the presidency, he was casting about for campaign themes when a friend urged him to take some time to think about what vision he wanted to offer the American people. Oh yeah, Bush responded dismissively, ""the vision thing.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was the only one-term Republican president in the last 80 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Drew Westen is a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University and the author of ""The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.""

The experiences he recounted were ""a source of amazement and inspiration,"" she wrote, not only for what they revealed about him ""but also because of what they instill in, and ask, of us."" She said she found herself ""hoping to hear, just once more, another story that would, by and by, perhaps change the way I see the world.""I was touched by the essay when I first read it, but also puzzled. If I had been asked to name justices who were immune to Thurgood Marshall's influence, Justice O'Connor, who had been on the court for 11 years and had served with him for 10 years, would have been on the list. She opposed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and her states'-rights orientation made her antagonistic to federal court review of state criminal justice issues. I was taken aback by her first line in a 1991 majority opinion that rejected an appeal from an inmate on Virginia's death row. ""This is a case about federalism,"" she declared. Justice Marshall dissented.And yet. By the time of her own retirement in 2006, Justice O'Connor was in a very different place. She wrote the majority opinion that preserved <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in university admissions. She modulated her views on federalism. It would be ridiculous to ascribe Justice O'Connor's migration in late middle age solely to the influence of Justice Marshall, who died in 1993. But it would be equally ridiculous to discount his influence entirely. Why not take her at her word? She must have sensed something in 1992, a pull in a different direction.Could President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, assuming her confirmation, inspire any of her new colleagues to see the world in a different way?There doesn't seem to be a Sandra Day O'Connor lurking within today's carefully constructed conservative supermajority, and the heroic trajectory of Thurgood Marshall's life is not Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's story. It's fair to say that she has more in common with the justice she has been named to replace. Like Stephen Breyer, she was a star student at an excellent public high school. Her father, like his, worked as a lawyer for a big-city school board (Miami in her case, San Francisco in his). Success at Harvard Law School propelled them both to a Supreme Court clerkship (in fact, she clerked for him). Justice Breyer is often referred to as the father of the federal sentencing guidelines and served on the original United States Sentencing Commission, where she later served as vice chair.In drawing these parallels, I have deliberately not emphasized race. Yes, her nomination fulfills the president's campaign promise to appoint a Black woman, the first to sit on the Supreme Court. While that's cause for celebration, it shouldn't obscure the other kinds of diversity she would bring to the court.Diversity has many dimensions, perspective among them. That she would be the first former public defender to sit on the court has received wide notice, less so the fact that as a public school graduate she would be a rarity among the justices. Justice Breyer's departure will leave only two, Elena Kagan, who attended the highly selective Hunter College High School in Manhattan, hardly a typical public school, and Samuel Alito, who went to Steinert High School in Hamilton Township, N.J., near Trenton, his hometown. Every other member of the court is a graduate of a Catholic high school, a striking but little-observed fact at a time when cases concerning public and religious schools and the relationship between the two are prominent on the court's docket.Justice Breyer's wife, Joanna, is a clinical psychologist who during her active career specialized in working with children being treated for cancer at the Lahey Clinic in Boston. Does having a medical professional in the family account for Justice Breyer's emphasis on facts and evidence in his opinions on medical subjects? With medical questions hardly about to disappear from the court's docket, it's worth noting that Judge Jackson's husband, Patrick, is a surgeon. (Justice Sonia Sotomayor's brother, Juan, is a doctor with an allergy practice in upstate New York.) Some conservative justices seem to assume that doctors don't act in the interest of their patients, whether performing abortions or administering vaccines. Maybe Judge Jackson will be able to persuade them otherwise.Or maybe not, but my point is that we cheat ourselves out of a full appreciation of what a person brings to the court if race is our only focus. On the day of Judge Jackson's nomination, Curt Levey, president of the right-wing interest group Committee for Justice, put out a statement that was as preposterous as it was predictable. ""Jackson should be asked about her views on race,"" the statement said, adding that ""at a time when a major <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> case is on the Supreme Court's docket and our nation is debating whether equality or equity should be the governing anti-discrimination standard, we hope that senators will ask Judge Jackson about her views on equity, racial preferences, disparate impact and the like.""Maybe it's only white nominees who are not expected to answer questions about pending cases. Maybe I missed other news releases from the Committee for Justice, but I don't remember Mr. Levey asking senators to drill down on the views on racial issues held by President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court nominees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Don't white Supreme Court nominees also have a race?Thurgood Marshall, born into segregation in 1908, was already a Supreme Court justice when Ketanji Brown was born 62 years later. She will walk through the doors that he opened. But her life story is not without power. She thrived at an integrated high school -- most public schools in the United States remain racially segregated -- where she was class president and a star debater, despite the lowered expectations that white administrators had for her.Her parents attended historically Black colleges, building a solid middle-class life for their children's future. Her teenage dream was to be a judge. By 2012, when the country had a president determined to diversify the federal courts, Judge Jackson had walked through every open door and was ready for Barack Obama.It's a quintessentially American success story. Thinking about what her role on the court might be, is it fanciful to suppose that some of her colleagues, age mates who checked the same boxes on their way to the top, might look at Ketanji Brown Jackson and see themselves? Perhaps in the very familiarity of her path to the Supreme Court -- a story that to others might look extraordinary -- might lie its ability to inspire, or at least to prompt conservatives who are sure of what they think to think again. No, I don't expect her to change the court. But she may well change the conversation, and that's a start.The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

6578eb199d938bc19925a731	aa_opeds_sample/txt/399095057.xml.txt	"<div><p>American Politics Aren't 'Post-Racial'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The not-quite-concluded racial drama playing out at Purdue University in the last months can't be ranked with the embittering rape charge scandal at Duke that so recently mesmerized the nation. And as news it's not in the same league as the total war waged against Harvard president Lawrence Summers for having had the temerity to suggest that factors in addition to prejudice might have something to do with the under-representation of women in math and the sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, what happened at Purdue is a pungent reminder of all that's possible now in the rarefied ideological atmosphere on our college campuses -- and in this presidential election year, not perhaps only on our campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story began prosaically enough. Keith Sampson, a student employee on the janitorial staff earning his way toward a degree, was in the habit of reading during work breaks. Last October he was immersed in ""Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson was in short order visited by his union representative, who informed him he must not bring this book to the break room, and that he could be fired. Taking the book to the campus, Mr. Sampson says he was told, was ""like bringing pornography to work."" That it was a history of the battle students waged against the Klan in the 1920s in no way impressed the union rep.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The assistant <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer who next summoned the student was similarly unimpressed. Indeed she was, Mr. Sampson says, irate at his explanation that he was, after all, reading a scholarly book. ""The Klan still rules Indiana,"" Marguerite Watkins told him -- didn't he know that? Mr. Sampson, by now dazed, pointed out that this book was carried in the university library. Yes, she retorted, you can get Klan propaganda in the library.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university has allowed no interviews with Ms. Watkins or any other university official involved in the case. Still, there can be no disputing the contents of the official letter that set forth the university's case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson stood accused of ""openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your Black co-workers."" The statement, signed by chief <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer Lillian Charleston, asserted that her office had completed its investigation of the charges brought by Ms. Nakea William, his co- worker -- that Mr. Sampson had continued, despite complaints, to read a book on this ""inflammatory topic."" ""We conclude,"" the letter informed him, ""that your conduct constitutes racial harassment. . . ."" A very serious matter, with serious consequences, it went on to point out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was in November. Months later, in February of this year, Mr. Sampson received -- from the same source -- a letter with an astonishingly transformed version of his offense. And there could be no mystery as to the cause of this change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the official judgment against him, Mr. Sampson turned to Indiana state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, whose office contacted university attorneys. Worse, the case got some sharp local press coverage that threatened to get wider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ludicrous harassment cases are not rare at our institutions of higher learning. But there was undeniably something special -- something pure, and glorious -- in the clarity of this picture. A university had brought a case against a student on grounds of a book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so the new letter to Mr. Sampson by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer Charleston brought word that she wished to clarify her previous letter, and to say it was ""permissible for him to read scholarly books or other materials on break time."" About the essential and only theme of the first letter -- the ""racially abhorrent"" subject of the book -- or the warnings that any ""future substantiated conduct of a similar nature could mean serious disciplinary action"" -- there was not a word. She had meant in that first letter, she said, only to address ""conduct"" that caused concern among his co-workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What that conduct was, the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer did not reveal -- but she had delivered the message rewriting the history of the case. Absolutely and for certain there had been no problem about any book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This, indeed, was now the official story -- as any journalist asking about the case would learn instantly from the university's media relations representatives. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved -- if not much -- by the extraordinary efforts of these tormented agents trying to explain that the first letter was all wrong: No reading of any book had anything to do with the charges against Mr. Sampson. This means, I asked one, that Mr. Sampson could have been reading about the adventures of Jack and Jill and he still would have been charged? Yes. What, then, was the offense? ""Harassing behavior."" While reading the book? The question led to careful explanations hopeless in tone -- for good reason -- and well removed from all semblance of reason. What the behavior was, one learned, could never be revealed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was, of course, no other offensive behavior; had there been any it would surely have appeared in the first letter's gusher of accusation. Like those prosecutors who invent new charges when the first ones fail in court, the administrators threw in the mysterious harassment count. Such were the operations of the university's guardians of equity and justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In April -- having been pressed by the potent national watchdog group FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) as well as the ACLU -- University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz finally sent them a letter expressing regret over this affair, and testifying to his profound commitment to freedom of expression. So far as can be ascertained, the university has extended no such expressions of regret to Keith Sampson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This case and all its kind are worth bearing in mind for anyone pondering the hypersensitivity surrounding the issue of race today. The mindset that produces those harassment courts, those super-heated capacities for perceiving insult, is not limited to college campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its presence is evident in this election campaign, which has seen more than a touch of readiness to impute some form of racism to all tough criticisms of Barack Obama. The deranged response that greeted Bill Clinton's remark that certain of Sen. Obama's claims were ""a fairy tale,"" told the story. No need to go into the now famous catalogue of accusations about the Clintons' ""sly racist"" tactics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There will be much more ahead, directed to the Republicans and their candidate. Some more, no doubt, about the Willie Horton ad of 1988, whose status as a quintessential piece of racism is -- except for a few rare voices of reason -- accepted throughout our media as revealed truth. To be sure, the Willie Horton charge has for some time been over-shadowed by ominous predictions of all the Swiftboating Republicans are supposed to be readying.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Obama himself, the candidate of racial transcendence, has now taken a plunge of sorts to old-style race politics. In a preemptive dismissal of future criticism, he warned a Florida audience on June 20, of the racist tactics the Republicans planned. ""We know the strategy,"" he said. Republicans planned to make people afraid of him. They'd say ""he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this may be far from the world of the universities. But to those aforementioned campus ideologues, the thinking is familiar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Correction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yesterday's op-ed article by Dorothy Rabinowitz, ""American Politics Aren't 'Post-Racial',"" misstated the name of the university. It is Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, not Purdue University. IUPUI is a partnership between Indiana University and Purdue University. Indiana University is the managing partner of IUPUI and is ""fully under the administrative authority of Indiana University,"" according to a Purdue spokesman, who added that ""Purdue University officials were not consulted and in no way were involved in any aspect of [Keith] Sampson's case.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(WSJ July 8, 2008)</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

He is telling us that were he not such an empathetic and benevolent president, African Americans would be far worse off. He suggests that no other president has shown such generosity to a group of people as helpless as we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I now know the cause of my indignation. Trump sounds like a slave master proclaiming that he is good to his Negroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To keep their slaves submissive, the masters would threaten to sell them to less compassionate owners if they got out of line. ""I have done more for the Black community"" sounds like a slave owner claiming that he's a good master because he doesn't beat his slaves as often or cut off their feet to stop them from fleeing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a racist, self-gratifying pronouncement that was passed down through generations of prominent white people who held power over African Americans. It was prevalent in the South during the 1960s, when Black women largely were domestic workers cleaning homes and caring for the children of white employers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was not uncommon for a white woman to brag to her friends about how good she was to her help. Though she paid wages too small to live on, she rewarded her ""girl"" with items from her home -- discarded furniture, clothing and trinkets that Black people struggling to put food on the table would never buy for themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump wants us to understand that even the first Black president, Barack Obama, couldn't fix our problems. Only someone like him -- white with an abundance of intellect -- could lead us to the Promised Land. But there's only so much he can do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's comments reflect the racist, stereotypical attitude he and others in his circle espouse about the Black community. He sees African Americans as violently barbaric people and describes our neighborhoods as ""living in hell.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has written us off as too dumb to understand how we have created these conditions ourselves. And he is losing patience with us because we refuse to acknowledge all that he does for us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, expressed it more bluntly. Appearing Monday on ""Fox & Friends,"" Kushner brought up the old racist adage that Black people can't succeed to the heights of white people because they don't want to be successful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""One thing we've seen in a lot of the Black community, which is mostly Democrat, is that President Trump's policies are the policies that can help people break out of the problems that they're complaining about,"" said Kushner, a top White House adviser. ""But he can't want them to be successful more than they want to be successful.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kushner went on to suggest that African Americans would rather complain than do what is necessary to improve their lives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, the white savior in the Oval Office has broken his back trying to help Black people, while we are being lazy and shiftless. This came from someone who came up in his father's business and is only in his prominent position because he is married to the president's daughter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The hypocrisy of both Kushner and Trump, who inherited wealth from his father, is astounding. It shows complete ignorance when it comes to the interplay between race and economics in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It overlooks the impressive achievements of large numbers of African Americans in spite of a system that historically has offered little or no assistance. It also ignores that this same system has successfully fought to tear down equalizers such as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> that sought to provide a bridge to economic parity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Speaking at Stanford University in 2017, Harvard University sociologist William Julius Wilson pointed out that the income of more affluent African Americans was increasing prior to Trump taking office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When adjusted for inflation, the percentage of African Americans earning at least $75,000 more than doubled to 21% from 1970 to 2014, he said. Those making $100,000 or more nearly quadrupled to 13%. In contrast, white Americans saw a less impressive increase, from 11 to 26%, he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By no means does that indicate that African Americans have reached economic parity in this county. In fact, we remain far from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it does prove that Trump is not the savior to Black people he claims to be. More so, it shows that African Americans can do, and always have done, a lot better without him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>dglanton@chicagotribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter @dahleeng</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CREDIT: Dahleen Glanton</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports	
6578eb199d938bc19925a731	test_question_neutral_testing_2	<p>Talking About Race in Akron</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid discussions about race are difficult even in intimate settings among well-acquainted people. For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>	stance:::Neutral

An F1 career blasts off</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lewis Hamilton is more than just Formula One's first black driver. We could be witnessing the arrival of a Tiger Woods on wheels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hamilton, 22, is off to the best start ever for an F1 rookie-- ever!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And at the highest level of automobile racing in the world, he's in some serious historical company: Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Jackie Stewart, Emerson Fittipaldi, Jimmy Clark . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His breakthrough victory could come as soon as Sunday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>F1 is abuzz with the numerology of Hamilton's onslaught: third in the season-opening Grand Prix of Australia, second last Sunday in Malaysia, so why not first in Bahrain this weekend?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When he wins may be a matter of when his McLaren-Mercedes team gives him the green light to go all out. So far he has been following F1 protocol for a junior driver, which is to defer to the senior teammate--in this case Fernando Alonso, who at 25 has won world championships the last two years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You have to understand the subtleties of F1 to get the entire meaning of what Hamilton said to his team via radio last Sunday, seconds after completing one of the most captivating second-place drives by anyone, rookie or not, in memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The radio transmission was uplinked to the world by satellite TV.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I want to win,"" Hamilton said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, of course he does. But you could read that not as a simple expression of ambition, but as a request to McLaren team boss Ron Dennis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Doesn't matter if it's the next race,"" Hamilton continued in the accent of his birthplace, England. ""But sometime this year, I'm going to have one.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider Hamilton's Malaysian drive:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He started fourth, but quickly, artfully, slipped past both Ferraris--better, quicker cars than his McLaren--into second place, falling in behind teammate Alonso, who had jumped from second into the lead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From there, Hamilton's job was not to challenge Alonso, but to fight a defensive action to hold off the favored Ferraris so Alonso could get away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Hamilton did, all race, in electrifying ways at times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Felipe Massa--whom Ferrari deems its rising star--tried three times to get around Hamilton. Three times Hamilton darted back ahead, making Massa look worse each time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I was able to trick him,"" Hamilton said afterward in an uplinked news conference, ""into out-braking himself, to the point that he went off [into the grass, on the third try].</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I apologize for that,"" Hamilton said, and then smiled with polite ruthlessness. ""But we have the points, so it doesn't really matter.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With 14 season points, Hamilton is third in the world championship standings, only four behind leader Alonso. That's the highest standing ever for a rookie at this point in a season. Only one other driver, Peter Arundel in 1964, scored podium finishes in his first two starts--a pair of thirds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Later in the Malaysian race Hamilton held off Kimi Raikkonen, widely considered the quickest driver in the world now that Schumacher has retired, in the other Ferrari. Alonso won easily because Hamilton fought the war. That's how it works in F1. But Hamilton was more impressive than his world-champion teammate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is but a touch of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in Hamilton's story-- just enough to be fair in the unspeakably expensive world of international formula racing. He has taken it from there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His father, Anthony Hamilton, born in England to immigrants from Grenada, bought Lewis a go-kart when he was 8. The youngster was so good that by age 13 he was signed to a developmental contract by McLaren's Dennis and Mercedes-Benz racing director Norbert Haug.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By 2005, Hamilton was making Dennis and Haug look prescient, dominating the F3 Euroseries with 15 victories and 13 poles. Then last year he soared through the GP2 series, the final stepping stone to F1, winning the championship on his first try.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Hamilton still might be waiting in the pipeline of the McLaren-Mercedes system if not for an ironic twist to what NASCAR considered its greatest coup yet toward driver diversity: the defection of Colombian star Juan Pablo Montoya from F1.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most monumental aspect of Montoya's move may turn out to be that it left a seat open at McLaren: the one Hamilton has filled so dazzlingly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ehinton@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: Lewis Hamilton gleefully displays his second-place trophy in Malaysia last Sunday.

6578eb199d938bc19925a731	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2234177127.xml.txt	"<div><p>Abroad at Home; Hypocrites in Power</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There have been contemptible Congresses before, and historians can argue about which was worst. But I remember none in modern times as dismal as the one now sitting, the 106th Congress. It has set new records in cynicism and hypocrisy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican leaders of the House appoint, as conferees on a bill to give patients more rights in managed-care health plans, members who oppose the bill. Without debate, the House votes to give an extra $1.7 billion in profits to companies that make student loans -- $692 million to one company alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They bleat about states' rights. But they push through a bill to override the physician-assisted-suicide law twice approved by Oregon voters, and another bill to bar state courts from hearing class actions brought against industries that make big political contributions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unable to do what they want through the regular legislative process, senators have tacked on to appropriation bills a dozen riders stripping away environmental protections. Indeed, there hardly is a regular legislative process anymore; controversial measures are increasingly embodied in riders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for me the most vicious example of the corrupted process was the Senate's 54-to-45 vote last month to reject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White of the Missouri Supreme Court to a federal district judgeship. Every one of the 55 Republican senators except one who was absent voted against Justice White. They all did so at the urging of their ultra-conservative colleague John Ashcroft of Missouri.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Ashcroft charged that Justice White was ''pro-criminal,'' had ''a serious bias against the death penalty'' and showed ''a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' As first demonstrated in a column by Benjamin Wittes of The Washington Post, those statements were lies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In support of his charge that Justice White is biased against the death penalty, Senator Ashcroft cited the case of a black defendant, Brian Kinder, sentenced to death for murder. When the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, Justice White dissented. Senator Ashcroft said the basis for the dissent was that the trial judge, Earl Blackwell, had said he ''opposed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.'' That was a brazen falsehood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Blackwell was running for re-election to the bench. A week before the Kinder trial he announced that he was switching parties to Republican because ''the Democrat party places far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work and people with a skin that's any color but white. . . . While minorities need to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hard-working taxpayers in this country.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kinder's lawyer asked Judge Blackwell to recuse himself because of his hostile statement suggesting that minorities were not ''hard-working taxpayers.'' The judge refused. The majority on the State Supreme Court said the statement would not ''cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality'' of Judge Blackwell. It was from that dubious assertion that Justice White dissented.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice White has voted to uphold 41 death sentences. He dissented in one case that involved the murder of a sheriff, and for that reason Missouri sheriffs and the National Sheriffs' Association opposed his confirmation. But the Missouri police organization endorsed him, saying Justice White's record ''has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real reason for Senator Ashcroft's opposition was that he is running for re-election next year and wants to look tough on crime. What is shocking is that the other Republicans joined in his cynical performance -- even a supposed moderate like Arlen Specter, who voted for Justice White twice in committee, and then against him on the floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because Justice White is an African-American, the Republicans were accused of racism in rejecting him. I think they were innocent of that charge. They were guilty of something else: dirtying the confirmation process and stabbing a good judge and a good man in the back. Stuart Taylor Jr., The National Journal's respected legal commentator, put it exactly: ''The Senate's vote and the smearing of Justice White were shameful acts of pettiness and partisanship.''</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
6578eb199d938bc19925a731	aa_opeds_sample/txt/434126284.xml.txt	"<div><p>Meet The New Elite, Not Like The Old</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- They are the children of 1969 -- the year that America's most prestigious universities began aggressively recruiting blacks and Latinos to their nearly all-white campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No longer would Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Columbia be the domain of the privileged. Instead, in response to the national soul-searching prompted by the civil rights movement, America's premier colleges would try to become more representative of the population as a whole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Forty years later, America is being led, to a striking extent, by a new elite, a cohort of the best and the brightest whose advancement was formed, at least in part, by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies. From Barack and Michelle Obama (Columbia, Princeton, Harvard) to Eric Holder (Columbia) to Sonia Sotomayor (Princeton, Yale) to Valerie Jarrett (Michigan, Stanford),  the country  is now seeing, in full flower, the fruition of this wooing of  minorities to institutions that for much of the nation's history have groomed America's leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet the consequences of that change remain unresolved, as became  clear on Friday, when Mr. Obama grappled a second time with the arrest of the Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his own home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The incident, the president said, offered the potential to soothe  longstanding distrust between minorities and police officers. But it also laid bare another reality, that the children of 1969, even those who now occupy niches at the top of society, regard their status as complicated, ambiguous and vulnerable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Whether I were black or white, I think that me commenting on this and hopefully contributing to constructive -- as opposed to negative -- understandings about the issue, is part of my portfolio,"" Mr. Obama said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a reminder that Mr. Obama, in addition to being the most powerful American, is also the fulfillment of the ideals embraced by Ivy League minority recruiters in 1969. Mr. Gates entered Yale that year, as one of 96 black freshmen. Today that number seems small. But there had been only six black students just three years before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gates belonged to the first <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> wave at top universities -- a wave that continued into the 1970s and the 1980s. I was one of its beneficiaries. A black 17-year-old from Monrovia, Liberia, I was one of some 200 black freshmen at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1983.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My first roommate was a white student from Seagrove, N.C., whose SAT scores and grade-point average were higher than mine. Privately, I consoled myself that I had qualifications that she didn't: I could name the capital of every country in Africa; countries she had never heard of. I knew where the Zambezi River emptied into the Indian Ocean. None of that had been on the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every now and then I feared I was faking it, that my white classmates had something I didn't. There were things they seemed to know instinctively, that I had to look up. I remember  getting laughed at during a game of Pictionary when I couldn't come up with the word for a giant bird landing on a lawn with a baby in its mouth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My feelings of inadequacy were not unusual, said David L. Evans, the Saturn/Apollo electrical engineer hired by Harvard in 1969 to help lead its <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program. When Mr. Evans visited public high schools in Arkansas in search of promising black students, he was met with skepticism. ""Even people who didn't have any mean-spiritedness would say to the students, 'You going to be up there with the Kennedys?' "" he recalled. "" 'How do you think you can make it there?' ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was  anxiety, too, among  the originators of race-based <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs. ""The idealistic version of why these universities embraced racial <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is that they said, 'Hey, we're in the business of training elites, it would be better for America if there were a diverse elite,' "" said Nicholas Lemann,  dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and  author of ""The Big Test,"" a history of the SAT and the rise of America's meritocracy. To its architects, the minority recruitment was the next phase for universities that for years had paved the way for whites, particularly the offspring of upper-class alumni, Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The cynical version of why they did this is they said, 'We can't control this country, it's becoming too diverse, we need to socialize the brighter minorities and make them more like us.' ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, being molded into people ""more like us"" gave the children of 1969 an advantage denied most of their white counterparts. They learned to navigate within a second world. They also absorbed some of its ideas and values. And they paved the way for the next generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""We had to go through this phase of larger integration for Barack Obama to be possible,"" Mr. Gates said in an interview a few days  after his arrest. ""It would have been impossible for Barack Obama to go from a historic black school to become president, at this time. The whole point is that a broad swath of America had to be able to identify with him.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also enabled Mr. Obama to run ""the most race-blind campaign"" of any black presidential candidate, said Gwen Ifill, the PBS news reporter whose book ""The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama"" examines the rise of African-Americans in politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps. But the children of 1969 dwell in a complex world. They retain  an ethnic identity that includes its own complement of cultural, historical and psychological issues and considerations. This emerged at Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearings. And it emerged again last week, when Mr. Obama joked in the White House East Room that if he ran afoul of the police, ""I'd get shot."" In saying this, he seemed to draw on the fears of black men across the United States, including those within the new power elite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Mr. Obama seemed to be demonstrating was what Mr. Lemann of Columbia calls a ""double consciousness"" that allows the children of 1969 to flow more easily between the world which their skin color bequeathed them and the world which their college degree opened up for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same double consciousness I acquired at U.N.C., though I didn't think about it that way as a student. Sure, my white friends were learning a little more about black (and African) culture from me. But I was absorbing much more from them, since they surrounded me in such great number. At the time it seemed I had the advantage;   I would leave college having gotten much more from my interactions with my white friends than they could possibly have gotten from me. And the principal thing I learned was how to make them feel at ease around me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, of course, on those occasions when one can't. Life outside the university doesn't duplicate the conditions of university life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I can't wear my Harvard gown everywhere I go,"" Professor Gates said. ""We -- all of us in the crossover generation -- have multiple identities, and being black trumps all of those other identities.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday Mr. Obama said he hoped Mr. Gates's incident might become a ""teachable moment."" It is a daunting task for the children of 1969: finding out whether the double consciousness they honed in the Ivy League can actually get this country to listen -- and react -- to race in a different way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HELENE COOPER           Helene Cooper, a White House correspondent for The Times, is the author of ""The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Princeton: Sonia Sotomayor.

Patrick Fitzgerald's Thursday news conference about the Duff financial empire. It was time for lunch; I was hungry and wanted to think this through. There was only one place to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""You've just got to go to Gene's,"" said a friend and colleague. She meant my favorite steakhouse, and the Duffs' favorite steakhouse, Gene & Georgetti's.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gene's is a hangout where information is traded, among politicians, insiders, reporters, wise-guys, salesmen, consultants, from the buttoned down to the gold chains crowd. And what makes it work is that they serve the best steak in the city, period. The service is impeccable without being showy and the drinks are honest. Gene's is a part of the old Chicago, the city as it was before so much of the downtown was turned into a theme park.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also the place where the Duffs came up to me about a year ago, their tough, hard eyes smiling. They asked me why they don't ever see my children playing in the front yard of my home in the suburbs. They asked it twice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the columns didn't stop and neither did the news stories by the investigative reporters, or Tribune editorials about the mayor's friends. And here's why:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not about getting personal with the mayor or the Duffs. Though the mayor has been a frequent target in my column, what drives the criticism is the obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars that go to his pals. In deal after deal after deal, the attitude is that his guys can take what they want and the people in the neighborhoods better shut up about it, while higher taxes put more and more pressure on families to pay for the deals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not personal, it's business, and it's your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley is an able politician and has done some good things, including taking personal responsibility for trying to improve the public schools. But he must also take personal responsibility for his friends who get rich on government contracts he controls, paid for by our tax dollars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Duff stories broke in 1999, when Tribune investigative reporters Ray Gibson, Andrew Martin and Laurie Cohen wrote about the Duffs' City Hall deals and their connections to Daley and the Outfit. You can find the archive of the stories available on the Tribune's Web site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of what was alleged in the indictments was laid out in those stories: that the Duffs, who are white, ran phony front companies that got $100 million in city contracts that should have gone to firms owned by women or minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley knew the Duffs were not minorities, even when he was a crime-fighting Cook County state's attorney. A Duff sits across from you, gives you campaign cash, pours a drink, it's reasonable to assume that even the mayor could tell whether the person was white or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Think back to how the media treated the late Mayor Harold Washington, when Washington's buddies were involved in contract scandals. Back then, even minor stories about corruption got sustained media attention, particularly from TV and radio, even if the dollar amounts were only chump change. Washington faced constant media pressure on corruption issues. TV crawled all over him for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If I was white, you wouldn't be doing this to me,"" Washington said once, in a private moment, as he filched a smoke from me and we stood in a parking lot after a campaign stop. We argued about it, and I told him that since we were off the record, he didn't have to play the race card. ""You don't know anything, do you?"" he said. He was right. I was a kid, then. I didn't know.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the Duff stories first broke, involving a white mayor and white guys getting rich, the Chicago media scrutiny wasn't as intense. TV news didn't hound Daley the way it hounded Washington. The mayor must appreciate the kindness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm sure he also appreciates the new federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald. The feds have already outflanked former Gov. George Ryan's Republicans. Ryan himself is a target. And now the feds are moving toward Daley's Democratic City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Daley-Duff relationship is not just a Tribune story anymore. A group of citizens--sworn as federal grand jurors--looked at the evidence. They didn't find a flaw in the system, as the city claims. They found a crime.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A couple friends and I talked of this at Gene's, about the change in things, about the importance of an independent federal prosecutor, about how the bipartisan political clique that runs this state tried to stop Fitzgerald's appointment in hopes of installing one of their own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just then, the cell phones began chirping and word of the Duff indictments began to spread through the bar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had our steaks medium rare.

I fell somewhere in the middle: She may have told the truth, but so what?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On bended knee, give thanks if you are too young to remember. A brief summary: Hill testified that then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her by verbally sharing his enjoyment of porn films and his sexual proficiency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, yawn if you must. This was scandalous, of course, because . . . well, I'm still not certain. You see, to be scandalized, one must be deeply sensitive to the mention of anything sexual. Indeed, in this case, one needed to be scandalized for an indefinite period of time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hill's testimony came several years after she worked for Thomas at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where the alleged harassment took place. In other words, she didn't protest at the time of these conversations, which were boorish, assuming they happened as she described. Or were they merely lame attempts at humor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The context has never been clear. In any case, other options available to Hill included telling Thomas to get over himself. Or, at the very least, assuming deep offense, complaining to a higher authority. She did neither, apparently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, nothing was mentioned until Thomas was nominated to the highest court. Would an African American nominee of the liberal persuasion have been subjected to the same kind of interrogation? Only as precedent to riot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clarence Thomas's ""offense"" had nothing to do with whether he did or did not say something off-color to a subordinate. Rather, his offense was being a conservative black man who had the audacity, among other things, to suggest that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> ultimately might do harm to those it was intended to help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now we are revisiting the Thomas hearings, sadly owing to the poor judgment of his wife, Ginni. As all surely know, she recently called Anita Hill and left a voice mail suggesting that Hill apologize for what she did. This jaw-droppingly odd lapse has prompted an unwelcome and sordid review of the past and a deluge of theories to explain Ginni Thomas's action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For one, the same day of the phone call, a story ran on the front page of the New York Times about Ginni Thomas's new nonprofit group, Liberty Central, which aims to organize the Tea Party movement. She was trying to monetize the moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's put a pause on nonsense and concede that the Thomas affair remains a painful memory and maybe, just maybe, the justice's wife needs resolution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, a new player has emerged in the drama: Lillian McEwen, a former Thomas girlfriend from way back, has decided that now is the time to set the record straight. Coincidentally, McEwen is shopping her memoir.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday night, McEwen sat down with Larry King on CNN (where I work) to share her own sexual past with Thomas and her belief that Hill told the truth. She told The Washington Post (where I am a columnist) that Thomas was ""obsessed with porn.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McEwen said she didn't mind the porn, she was just bored by it. She also told King that Thomas, who quit drinking while they were together, became ambitious and obsessed with physical fitness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thomas's history of drinking is no secret to anyone who bothered to read his memoir, ""My Grandfather's Son."" He is brutally honest about his transformation from an angry boy abandoned by his alcoholic father, his upbringing by his grandfather and the nuns at his little Catholic school, and his battle with his own demons and lonely rages to become a thoughtful man deeply respected by fellow members of the court. As Supreme Court analyst Jan Greenburg wrote in ""Supreme Conflict,"" Thomas is the quiet force on the bench who brings others to change their minds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only the heartless would not be moved by Thomas's description of lying at home in a fetal curl, suffering the public humiliation of his hearing, and recognizing that the only route to survival was humility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It had long since become clear to me that this battle was at bottom spiritual, not political,"" he wrote, ""and so my attention shifted from politics to the inward reality of my spiritual life.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proud Thomas said during those hearings that he was the victim of a high-tech lynching. Let's hope he has enough spiritual reserve to survive this second lynching  --  and a big enough heart to forgive poor Ginni.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kathleenparker@washpost.com</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

I am grateful to the State Transportation Department for putting together for me an accounting of how much has been spent so far on the court-stalled Westway project and who has received the money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Transportation Department has been in charge of overseeing the 4.2-mile superhighway-waterfront development to replace the crumbled West Side Highway in lower Manhattan - a construction opus that was once estimated to cost $1.4 billion but is now projected at $4 billion or more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To date, the state agency reported, $75 million has been spent, out of $100 million authorized, on the preliminary planning and construction work - and much more is to come. The last time an accounting of this groundwork spending appeared in public print - in a story in this newspaper four years ago - the figure was only $18 million out of the $21 million allocated - so the engineers and consultants and contractors have been, so to speak, active.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ninety percent of the money has come from the Federal Highway Trust Fund and 10 percent from the state - which has led some of the promoters of the project to behave as if it will cost us next to nothing. But there is no guarantee from Congress that the rest of the project would be fully funded by this 90-10 formula; the indications, in fact, have been to the contrary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I felt it would be instructive if I reproduced here the salient portions of the Transportation Department's spending list. Because of the length of that list, I chose half a million dollars as the cutoff point; those consultants who have received less should not feel slighted at being omitted here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas and subcontractors - the main engineers for the project ... $24,833,500 System Design Concepts and subcontractors - the main consultants, who became part of the state government and directed the project until recently ... $8,671,707</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mueser, Rutledge, Johnston & DeSimone - soil engineers ...  $6,163,184</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hardesty & Hanover/Andrews & Clark (joint venture) - preliminary engineering designs ... $698,000</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ammann & Whitney - preliminary engineering designs ... $712,400 Howard, Needles, Tammen & Bergendorff - preliminary engineering designs ... $858,472 The Port Authority - monitor of a test boring and design consultant work regarding Authority facilities ... $595,625 Warren George Inc. - contractor for test borings ... $2,900,862 Clarke & Rapuano/Venturi Rauch & Scott Brown (joint venture ) - landscape architects for park design ... $995,671 R.T.P.

65a19f3684065b3606fbaa13	aa_opeds_sample/txt/398881739.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Incredible Shrinking Kennedy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It could have been a far different election season this fall for Maryland's gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two summers ago, had Al Gore and his advisers stretched their imaginations beyond the hyperbolic ""ground-breaking"" choice of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as running mate, and tapped Mrs. Townsend instead, it's quite possible she'd be vice president today, stumping for Democratic candidates along with President Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lieberman's peak as a candidate in 2000 occurred on the very day he was chosen by Mr. Gore, with the expected mainstream media exultation at the ""daring"" selection of a Jewish man given the nod. Not only was the Connecticut senator overmatched by Dick Cheney in their one debate, but his hollow threats of censoring the entertainment industry, while accepting massive donations from Hollywood moguls, exposed him as a hypocrite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend was excluded from Mr. Gore's ""short list"" because of her inexperience -- one-and-a-half terms as Maryland's lieutenant governor and a failed congressional race in 1986 -- and presumably because her state is one of the most reliably Democratic in the nation. However, there's little doubt that her candidacy would not have cost Mr. Gore a single state he eventually won against President Bush. In fact, given her pedigree as Robert F. Kennedy's eldest child, with an extended family campaigning for the ticket, it's likely the team would've won New Hampshire, West Virginia and Florida, and thus the election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Mrs. Townsend, never a nimble candidate on her own, is struggling to fend off Republican Rep. Robert Ehrlich in this year's battle to succeed the unpopular Parris Glendening as Maryland's governor. The contest has been mired in a statistical dead heat since mid-summer -- a Mason-Dixon Maryland poll last weekend showed Mrs. Townsend leading Mr. Ehrlich by a 46% to 45% margin -- as Mrs. Townsend has failed to lock up the state's large black electorate, a base of voters that's typically a given for a Democratic candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend's political pitch has been less than perfect. In June she angered Baltimore City's black leaders by choosing retired Navy Admiral Charles Larson, a white former Republican, as her running mate. Mr. Ehrlich, meanwhile, a four-term congressman from Baltimore County, chose a black man, Michael Steele.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fairness, the current political environment, influenced as it's been by corporate scandals and a backlash against wealthy businessmen, doesn't make the most hospitable turf for a candidate born to privilege. In contrast to Mrs. Townsend, Mr. Ehrlich was reared in the blue-collar Baltimore suburb of Arbutus, where he earned an academic/sports scholarship to Princeton. He then returned to Maryland, spending eight years in the state's House of Delegates before being elected to Congress in 1994.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The juxtapositions of the two candidates have been occasionally startling, and more than occasionally provided good campaign rhetoric for Mr. Ehrlich. Last July, when Mrs. Townsend had a fund-raiser for glittering contributors at her family's mythic Hyannis Port compound, Mr. Ehrlich held a $20 per person crab-and-beer fest in Anne Arundel County. He remarked at the time, ""We're having fun, obviously. The lieutenant governor is home, and I am home.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the polls tightened during the summer, Mrs. Townsend shed her pledge to wage a ""positive"" campaign and hired longtime Kennedy confidante Robert Shrum, the populist millionaire known for slash-and-burn advertising and rhetoric. Four years ago, Mr. Shrum orchestrated an attack against Gov. Glendening's GOP opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, that called her a racist, a charge that even Democrat and then-Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke repudiated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter Beinart, editor of the New Republic, wrote in the magazine's Oct. 21 issue that ""Election 2002 does have at least one ennobling characteristic: Race has never mattered less."" But in Maryland that's not true. In a late-September debate held at the predominantly black Morgan State University and sponsored by the allegedly nonpartisan NAACP, Mrs. Townsend attacked her competitor's opposition to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Mr. Ehrlich ""opposes <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> based on race,"" she said, ""Well, let me tell you something, slavery was based on race. Lynching was based on race. Discrimination is based on race. Jim Crow was based on race. And <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> should be based on race.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One can question Mr. Ehrlich's consent to debate Mrs. Townsend in such a setting -- his family was booed upon entering the auditorium -- but it's not clear that such demagoguery will work. A Democratic consultant in Maryland told me that ""KKT won the debate in the hall, but Ehrlich won it on TV because the performance of the NAACP and the mob in the auditorium turned off many white voters.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither is it clear that Mrs. Townsend's caricature of Mr. Ehrlich as a Gingrich-style extremist resonates with voters. While he has voted with the Republican majority in the House 90% of the time, his moderate views on social issues -- qualified support for abortion rights, legalization of marijuana for terminal patients and pro-stem cell research -- hardly squares with her charge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The result of this race might be determined by the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan region, including Maryland's Democratic Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. Mrs. Townsend has aired television advertisements in the past week slamming Mr. Ehrlich for his record on gun control, while on the stump emphasizing her own family's well-known tragedies at the hands of lunatic assassins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether this politicization of a hot-button issue invigorates her base supporters or turns off independents who believe she's exploiting the killings could decide the election. Even Maureen Dowd, the liberal New York Times op-ed columnist criticized Mrs. Townsend, writing on Oct. 16: ""Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is trying to capitalize on her personal history with tragic gun killings to save her limp gubernatorial bid.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An even bigger question is whether citizens in Maryland -- especially in areas where the sniper has killed -- will be motivated to vote on Election Day if the assailant isn't apprehended by then. A low turnout is bad news for Mrs. Townsend, and should Mr. Ehrlich prevail, will terminate her future political career.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Smith, a Baltimore resident for 14 years, is editor-in-chief of the New York Press, for which he writes the ""Mugger"" column.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

Austin's affirmative action program is a careful effort to ensure diversity (Posted 2014-07-28 00:15:53)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LAST YEAR, the Supreme Court ordered the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to reconsider the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> program at the University of Texas at Austin. This month, the appeals court determined again that the university's admissions policies were constitutional. This was not much of a surprise: The 5th Circuit sided with the university the last time it examined this case. Much less predictable is how the Supreme Court will rule when the dispute comes before the justices for a second time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We wouldn't accuse them of having an easy task. Every American should be wary of any instance in which the government distinguishes between people based on race, with bad or good motivations. But in its ruling, the 5th Circuit offered the justices several good reasons to side with the university. Among them: If, as the justices have said, the Constitution can bear public universities instituting some kind of narrow, careful <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> admissions policies, UT Austin's modest program is a prime example of the sort that should survive judicial scrutiny.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Texas fills most of the seats at its premier public university with students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school classes -- state policy guarantees them admission. This has had the effect of drawing some students from areas of the state where minorities make up the majority without distinguishing among students based on race. The case is about what the university can do from there. UT fills the rest of its classes with students who get in under a comprehensive, holistic review of their academic and personal records. In that analysis, race can be used as ""a factor of a factor of a factor of a factor,"" as advocates put it, as admissions officers assemble a complete picture of an applicant's profile. The 5th Circuit points out that this resembles the sort of individualized review of applicants that the Supreme Court has insisted must occur if race is to be explicitly considered in public university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university's opponents charge that the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> policy is unnecessary. The top 10 percent program already pulls in minority students. Why do any more?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the reasons are the fact that the top 10 percent scheme's effects on diversity stem from ongoing racial segregation in Texas schools. The scheme also is a blunt tool that overlooks applicants who want to and would contribute to the university. The experience of a minority applicant from a majority minority school, for example, may well be quite different than that of a minority applicant from a majority white school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another lesson from the 5th Circuit's ruling: One reason this and other <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> cases are difficult is that the Supreme Court has not offered public university officials clear guidance on what is constitutionally acceptable. According to the court, public universities, for example, can attempt to achieve a ""critical mass"" of minority students on campus to expose students to diverse viewpoints and prepare them to participate in a multi-ethnic society. What a ""critical mass"" looks like, though, is not certain. The Supreme Court should clear up the confusion. In the process, the justices should affirm that UT's conscientiously designed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> program, a cautious effort to complement the race-neutral top 10 percent program and seek diversity from a range of student profiles, is permissible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

The great secret is out: Liberals dominate campuses. Coming soon: ""Moon Implicated in Tides, Studies Find.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One study of 1,000 professors finds that Democrats outnumber Republicans at least seven to one in the humanities and social sciences. That imbalance, more than double what it was three decades ago, is intensifying because younger professors are more uniformly liberal than the older cohort that is retiring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another study, of voter registration records, including those of professors in engineering and the hard sciences, found nine Democrats for every Republican at Berkeley and Stanford. Among younger professors, there were 183 Democrats, six Republicans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we essentially knew this even before the American Enterprise magazine reported in 2002 on examinations of voting records in various college communities. Some findings about professors registered with the two major parties or with liberal or conservative minor parties:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cornell: 166 liberals, 6 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stanford: 151 liberals, 17 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Colorado: 116 liberals, 5 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UCLA: 141 liberals, 9 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics reports that in 2004, of the top five institutions in terms of employee per capita contributions to presidential candidates, the third, fourth and fifth were Time Warner, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft. The top two were the University of California system and Harvard, both of which gave about 19 times more money to John Kerry than to George W. Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at Berkeley, denies that academic institutions are biased against conservatives. The disparity in hiring, he explains, occurs because conservatives are not as interested as liberals in academic careers. Why does he think liberals are like that? ""Unlike conservatives, they believe in working for the public good and social justice."" That clears that up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A filtering process, from graduate school admissions through tenure decisions, tends to exclude conservatives from what Mark Bauerlein calls academia's ""sheltered habitat."" In a dazzling essay in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Bauerlein, professor of English at Emory University and director of research and analysis at the National Endowment for the Arts, notes that the ""first protocol"" of academic society is the ""common assumption"" -- that, at professional gatherings, all the strangers in the room are liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a reasonable assumption, given that in order to enter the profession, your work must be deemed, by the criteria of the prevailing culture, ""relevant."" Bauerlein says that various academic fields now have regnant premises that embed political orientations in their very definitions of scholarship:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Schools of education, for instance, take constructivist theories of learning as definitive, excluding realists (in matters of knowledge) on principle, while the quasi-Marxist outlook of cultural studies rules out those who espouse capitalism. If you disapprove of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, forget pursuing a degree in African-American studies. If you think that the nuclear family proves the best unit of social well-being, stay away from women's studies.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This gives rise to what Bauerlein calls the ""false consensus effect,"" which occurs when, because of institutional provincialism, ""people think that the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population."" There also is what Cass Sunstein, professor of political science and jurisprudence at the University of Chicago, calls ""the law of group polarization."" Bauerlein explains: ""When like-minded people deliberate as an organized group, the general opinion shifts toward extreme versions of their common beliefs."" They become tone-deaf to the way they sound to others outside their closed circle of belief.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When John Kennedy brought to Washington such academics as Arthur Schlesinger Jr., John Kenneth Galbraith, McGeorge and William Bundy and Walt Rostow, it was said that the Charles River was flowing into the Potomac. Actually, Richard Nixon's administration had an even more distinguished academic cast -- Henry Kissinger, Pat Moynihan, Arthur Burns, James Schlesinger and others.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Academics such as the next secretary of state still decorate Washington, but academia is less listened to than it was. It has marginalized itself, partly by political shrillness and silliness that have something to do with the parochialism produced by what George Orwell called ""smelly little orthodoxies.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many campuses are intellectual versions of one-party nations -- except such nations usually have the merit, such as it is, of candor about their ideological monopolies.

The searing news of the disproportionate rates of COVID-19 among Black Americans has added to the urgency of this moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But not for Donald Trump. His long record of embracing racism as a political tool -- from his promotion of the ""birther"" lie about Barack Obama to his defense of white supremacists -- has made him the most racially polarizing president in the last century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet while many Republican ""Never Trumpers"" condemn Trump for his brazen appeals to white supremacy, they are curiously silent on Ronald Reagan's record on race and civil rights. It's no accident that the Party of Reagan morphed so easily into the Party of Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long before Trump descended his golden escalator, promising to ""Make America Great Again,"" Reagan was the first to use the slogan ""Let's Make America Great Again,"" vowing to return America to its past glory before the civil rights movement toppled Jim Crow in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whenever the issue of Reagan's hostility to civil rights and unpopularity with Black Americans is broached, conservatives leap to Reagan's defense and stress his apparent lack of personal racism. That view has been shredded by the disclosure last year of a phone call in October 1971 between Richard Nixon and Reagan, in which Reagan described African diplomats as ""monkeys"" who were still ""uncomfortable wearing their shoes.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan's sunny vision of America as a ""shining city"" may be the antithesis of Donald Trump's dystopian American ""carnage,"" he masterfully deployed racially coded language and other dog whistles like ""states' rights,"" ""law and order"" and ""welfare queens"" that resonated with middle-class taxpayers without appearing racist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telling illustration is Reagan's decision to give a major speech in his 1980 campaign at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., only miles from where three civil rights workers -- James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner -- were murdered in 1964. Looking back, it is eerily similar to Trump's decision to hold a campaign rally on the day after Juneteenth in Tulsa, Okla., the site of the worst racial massacre in the 20th century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan was the first presidential nominee of a major political party to attend that fair since it started in 1889, and that fact was not lost on the 20,000 white people gathered there on Aug. 3, 1980, many proudly waving Confederate flags and chanting, ""We want Reagan! We want Reagan!"" The crowd was exhilarated with his declaring his fidelity to states' rights, which for a century had been the South's rallying cry to prevent the federal government from interfering with its racial customs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That speech helped Reagan sweep every Southern state except President Carter's home state of Georgia. Since then, the Old Confederacy has been the heart of the GOP. On the eve of Reagan's inauguration, Black Americans feared an assault on the civil rights gains of the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These fears were well-founded. After all, Reagan began his political career with his 1966 campaign for California governor by denouncing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, while running radio ads referring to urban areas as ""jungles.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only months after the Watts riots, Reagan made ""law and order"" and opposition to California's far-reaching Fair Housing Act the centerpiece of his campaign to oust the liberal incumbent, Pat Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan repeatedly said, ""If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes in the sale or renting of his property, it is his right to do so."" This stance resonated with millions of middle-class white voters, many of whom had never voted for a Republican, but voted for Reagan in part because they feared African Americans moving into their neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan's success in making inroads with white working-class voters in the booming suburbs of Southern California was a template for the ""law and order"" and ""silent majority"" rhetoric that fueled Nixon's presidential victory in 1968. Reagan mounted an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination in 1968, in which he crisscrossed the South and white enclaves across the country thrilling conservative audiences with his scorching attacks on lawless civil rights agitators and his tough talk of law and order. Just hours after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, Reagan called King's assassination ""a great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order and people started choosing which laws they'd break.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1976, Reagan, in challenging Gerald Ford for the Republican presidential nomination, popularized the racist trope of a ""welfare queen,"" repeating at virtually every campaign stop, before white audiences, the fictitious story of a Black welfare cheat, subsidized by hardworking white taxpayers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, Reagan's two-term presidency marked a new nadir in race relations. His administration tried to dilute the Voting Rights Act, vitiated the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and vowed to abolish <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, arguing that white men were the only victims -- of reverse discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan's attitudes on civil rights were reflected in his refusal to impose sanctions on the apartheid government of South Africa; he vetoed a 1986 bill imposing sanctions, which Congress overrode. Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu was so incensed that he declared Reagan ""a racist, pure and simple.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most egregiously, Reagan was instrumental in ratcheting up the ""war on drugs,"" which has led to the mass incarceration of Black and poor people of color and the destruction of families and communities. His administration adopted a series of draconian laws that resulted in the imprisonment rate of African Americans on drug charges that is almost six times that of whites, even though whites use illicit drugs at a similar rate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan eschewed the overt racism of Trump, his racial politics paved the way for Trump. In fact, Reagan's brand of racism was perhaps more sinister than Trump's because he did it with a genial smile. In reckoning with Trump, we need to reckon with Reagan's legacy. And that began with his appeal to white voters in Southern California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: RONALD REAGAN, at the 1976 GOP National Convention, repeatedly used the trope of the Black ""welfare queen"" to appeal to white voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:David Hume Kennerly Getty Images</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Daniel S.

Rehnquist has cancer is how much information the court owes the public about the chief justice's health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only facts revealed -- that Rehnquist has one of several forms of thyroid cancer and that he received a tracheotomy at Bethesda Naval Hospital before being discharged Friday -- were enough to fuel speculation by medical experts about the 80-year- old's condition but not to settle the most pressing questions about the future of the chief justice, and of the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court's terseness is consistent with its long tradition of discretion concerning justices' personal lives. With few exceptions - - in 1975, after a crippling stroke, Justice William O. Douglas held a news conference -- health information about the life-tenured members of the court is especially closely guarded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tradition was born in the days before the court played a central role in policymaking. But now, when the court has a role in everything from whether race can be considered in college admissions to the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, some are saying that tradition has to change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If the chief justice's medical prognosis is indeed such that he may not be able to finish this term, that's something the American people have a right to know, especially where you have dueling doctors speculating about the meaning of a tracheotomy,"" said David J. Garrow, a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at Emory University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If it were [Speaker of the House] Dennis Hastert or [Senate Minority Leader] Tom Daschle, people would say there is an unchallengeable public right to know as much as the public official himself knows,"" Garrow said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others defended the court's approach. They noted the constitutional differences between the judiciary and the other branches of government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The court operates according to a different rule,"" said Michael A. Carvin, a former Reagan administration Justice Department official. ""There is no constitutional transition issue like you have with the president. There is no day-to-day, commander-in-chief-type responsibility. You can operate the court on autopilot. You can't operate the presidency that way.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also is possible that not even the chief justice is certain about his condition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""In my opinion, he owes the public whatever he gives the public,"" said Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper, a former Rehnquist law clerk. ""He may still be finding things out himself.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SWINGER: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role on the court, long a matter of conventional wisdom among lawyers, has been confirmed by the latest quantitative methods of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a forthcoming North Carolina Law Review article, professors Andrew D. Martin, Kevin Quinn and Lee Epstein show not only that O'Connor is the court's ""median voter,"" but also that the 74-year- old has moved steadily to the left in recent years, taking the court with her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of math is involved, but basically the professors ranked justices on a numerical scale, assigning point values to their ideological leanings as shown through their votes. The higher the number, the more conservative the voting record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2002, the last term covered by the study, Justice Clarence Thomas was the most conservative, with a score of 3.637; Justice John Paul Stevens, at -2.516, was the most liberal. O'Connor's score, 0.247, just a hair to the right of center, represented the court's midpoint. O'Connor's score has gone down steadily, or become more liberal, since 1994. In that year, she was at 0.637.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study also argues that, but for O'Connor's evolution, the court would not have approved of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, which it did in 2003, by a 5 to 4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to their calculations, the political scientists say, ""the likelihood of O'Connor providing the key vote to uphold the program was quite small for any term prior to 2001.""</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes
65a19f3684065b3606fbaa13	test_question_against_testing_1	<p>TESTING THE WATERS DROPPING THE SAT WOULD MEAN FAILING STUDENTS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Got a weight problem? Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>		stance:::None/Not Discussed		
65a19f3684065b3606fbaa13	aa_opeds_sample/txt/408366163.xml.txt	"<div><p>Foreign Affairs in Annapolis</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rushern L. Baker III, a Maryland state legislator from Cheverly in Prince George's County, was ""a little taken aback"" when a former ambassador and a deputy assistant secretary of state showed up in Annapolis to lobby him last week. Their mission: to block a Baker proposal to impose sanctions against companies that do business in Nigeria, a wanton human-rights abuser in Africa.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State Department officials, like those from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, increasingly are finding that they have to negotiate with Americans as well as their foreign counterparts. From Massachusetts to California to New York City, local initiative and foreign policy are coming into conflict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is America's thickening connections with the world. ""You have to go back to George Washington's day to find a time when the United States was as dependent on foreign trade and investment as it is today,"" says Alan Larson, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs and the boss of last week's emissaries to Annapolis. In 1970 imports and exports were equivalent to 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product; today they're up to 30 percent. U.S. investments overseas, and foreign investments here, also have soared.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's not just a question of volume. As ties grow, the United States increasingly is trying to shape other countries' societies. Trade talks used to focus on tariffs, duties, anti-dumping provisions and other matters that only trade lawyers understood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. officials focus on what they call ""non-tariff barriers"": corruption, inadequate antitrust law, even zoning-like regulations that may work against U.S. products. In Europe, the United States is fighting health laws that keep out U.S. beef. In Japan, the United States attacks laws that help preserve neighborhoods by shielding small shops from competition -- but also make life difficult for U.S. exporters. U.S. labor unions want the administration to pressure other nations to allow collective bargaining.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, other nations don't always welcome these initiatives. Even less surprisingly, they have their own ideas about how the United States should organize itself. To win the right to challenge foreign barriers before international judges, America has had to subject itself to the same rules. Baker says he modeled his anti-Nigeria law on state laws that helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But in the intervening years, the United States has signed on to treaties that preclude such laws -- and that give other nations the right to demand compensation from Washington if their firms are barred in Maryland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no question, the State Department's Larson says, that the stuff of international negotiation today tends tend to ""get into your living room"" more than in the past. He should know; he's point man for a treaty-in-progress known as the Multilateral Agreement on Investments. Under negotiation for 2 1/2 years, this far-reaching pact would in most cases bind nations to treat foreign companies as they do their own, so that firms can invest across borders without fear of expropriation or unfair favoritism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The MAI hasn't yet attracted much attention in Washington. But it's the object of fevered opposition on talk radio and in some corners of the Internet. In the preface to a recently published tract, ""MAI and the Threat to American Freedom,"" Lori Wallach and Ralph Nader describe the proposed treaty as ""enormously secretive and powerful"" and ""a slow-motion coup d'etat against democratic governance in the United States, Canada and abroad. . . . ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to being secretive, the entire soporific text is available on the Web site of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, under whose auspices the negotiations are taking place (www.oecd.org). But opponents are more persuasive when they list decisions they say could be taken out of Americans' hands. Since MAI would forbid countries from demanding a certain level of investment, wouldn't the Community Reinvestment Act -- which says banks must invest in low-income neighborhoods -- be thrown out? Since the treaty bans anything ""tantamount"" to expropriation, couldn't a foreign tobacco company challenge advertising restrictions that reduce the value of its investment? What about state laws that limit hunting licenses or farmland ownership to locals, minority contractor set-asides, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, right-to-work laws?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials say none of these would be affected. Government procurement would be exempted, all state and local laws would be grandfathered, the ""tantamount"" language would be amended to underscore the inviolability of legitimate health, environmental and safety regulation. Moreover, they argue that MAI would help American workers, because U.S. firms in today's economy need to operate effectively abroad to remain healthy at home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Clinton administration, still smarting from the defeat of fast-track trade legislation, isn't pushing MAI too hard. The original plan was to wrap up talks by May; now U.S. officials say they need at least another year, and they'll oppose any firm deadline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More to the point, they have learned from fast-track that they have to consult, while treaties are still being shaped, more than ever before -- with unions, local officials, environmentalists and others. The more the scope of trade talks goes beyond tariffs, the less they can be left exclusively to trade officials.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, as State Department officials know from their work in foreign capitals, consultation doesn't guarantee agreement. ""The State Department testimony only helped me more,"" says Baker. ""They admitted that what's going on in Nigeria is terrible -- and they couldn't point to much that they are doing about it."" Before it's over for U.S. diplomats, Annapolis may make Pyongyang look easy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is a member of the editorial page staff.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

""They have a culture that seems not to encourage achievement. Failure is not looked upon with disgrace.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Talk about pushing buttons. Politicians who roam the halls of the nearby state Capitol went ballistic. ""This is not the kind of academic riffraff that our taxpayers should be supporting,"" argued an African-American state senator from Dallas. A Hispanic colleague of his wrote University of Texas Chancellor William Cunningham to argue that Graglia's remarks ""amount to cultural character assassination"" and should not ""be protected by academic freedom.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reactionary students who also value political correctness more than open debate called for Graglia's dismissal. And knees wobbling, even the law school faculty disassociated itself from their colleague's remarks. Some genuflected in the direction of free speech, to be sure, but the emphasis was on disagreeing with Graglia without actually pinpointing why.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And therein lies an important point: Today, Americans who are supposed to be the stewards of our political and academic traditions are still debating whether there should be free speech, rather than accepting that right as a given and using it as a tool for seriously addressing the major public policy questions of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In truth, Graglia's concern about the underachievement of minorities at ""selective institutions"" was not unfounded. Hispanics and blacks are not doing as well as mainstream students, a point made long ago by Hoover Institution senior fellow Thomas Sowell, who is black. Likewise, scholars have noted that certain Asian-American groups appear to have a culture that does produce high academic achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Graglia has a right to oppose <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, which was the real object of his opinions. But where he erred was in leaving room for the interpretation that minority underachievement is inescapable because minorities are by definition underachievers. Leaving aside the issue of tautologies, isn't it likely that disparate socioeconomic circumstances might be a relevant factor? Doesn't the disproportionate convergence of race and poverty have a bearing on minority achievement in America today? Isn't chronic low-skill immigration in states such as Texas to be considered as a factor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Graglia may wish to recall American history. During the third great wave of immigration to the United States earlier in this century, low-skill immigrants from places like rural Italy came in for an enormous amount of prejudice and discrimination because it was assumed that being poor and uneducated they could not improve themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over time, however, a number of factors came together to catapult millions of Italian-Americans into the mainstream. They became mayors, governors, Cabinet members and federal judges. Is it just possible that Graglia might soften his views toward Hispanics against such a backdrop? Is it possible that he might consider that racism and other factors have played a disproportionate role in keeping blacks down?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was having lunch in Santa Monica, Calif., the other day after a panel discussion on immigration, race and education, when I heard an articulate person at my table say that bigots needed to be shown up for what they are, or else they may be taken seriously. There is some truth in that, but it also seems to me that people who can't identify a bigot on their own or who are prone to allege bigotry where none exists are nearly as dangerous as the bigot. That is precisely why the country is more in need of education through dialogue rather than exhortation, peroration or condemnation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of all people, President Clinton needs to be reminded that such a dialogue must take in a variety of points of view. But on issues of race, don't look for nuance from Clinton. ""Those kinds of remarks don't go down well with the president, period,"" said White House press secretary Mike McCurry in condemning Graglia's opinions out of hand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, Graglia hurt a lot of people's feelings in how he said what he said. In ignoring America's past and overlooking the redemptive promise this country has held out to groups that have triumphed over time after having started at the bottom, the truth about impoverished minorities and their potential has eluded him. Even so, he deserves tolerance from a society willing to engage in a complicated discussion where hurt feelings are inevitable.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

""If the arsenic issue cannot be 'won,' it will be hard to win anything that matters.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus the quick turnaround on the pro-salmonella proposal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adler's e-mail notes people should have stressed that there were ""no industry beneficiaries"" in voiding the Clinton move and that there was still a federal arsenic regulation in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enviros such as Elliott Negin of the Natural Resources Defense Council, however, insists the problem was that the facts didn't back the Bush team. Negin said, for example, the Environmental Arsenic Council, a trade group of chemical, oil and mining companies, staunchly opposed the new standard already adopted by the Europeans - - and the old federal standard was adopted in 1942, before it was known that arsenic was a carcinogen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Adler may be right about this. People cringe at the word ""arsenic."" Industry must level the playing field and rename arsenic. Perhaps ""Rosewater?"" Or ""Passion Mist?"" Maybe ""Old Lace?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What happened to those guys who came up with ""fecal matter?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And now, the first of a likely endless string of fundraisers and political to-dos at the Clinton home in Northwest. Our invite from all the Democratic women senators says they're holding a ""special reception honoring"" Sen.

But there's a problem for all those well-heeled PAC folks. It's ""Personal checks only."" So if you want to see maison Clinton and those new decorations, it's going to come out of your pocket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember the Dan Burton cuff links on eBay for $9.99 that got no bids for five days?

RIGHT AT THE POLLS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Internet has made it easier than ever to find information, buy books, communicate with people all over the world, and goof off at work. Now it promises to simplify a dreary task that looms before us this year: choosing a president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No, it does not provide the sort of ""help"" offered by glad- handing office-seekers who are eager to enumerate their heroic virtues and inspiring achievements--and to mournfully recite the many ways in which every single one of their opponents falls short. Between now and November, we will have plenty of middle-age men in blue suits doing their utmost to talk us into making a decision congenial to their interests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you would prefer to make a decision congenial to your interests, you can consult a couple of Web sites that serve the function for politics that the personal ads serve for romance: matching compatible partners. They give you questionnaires asking your views on various national issues, tabulate your answers, and tell you with whom you are most likely to find long-term happiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of these is selectsmart.com, where the range of choices goes from Pat Buchanan to Ralph Nader, though it also includes all the sane people in the race. Candidates you have probably never heard of before, such as David McReynolds and Howard Phillips, are there, and the site provides sufficient candidate information to explain why you have never heard of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The questionnaire asks about abortion, crime, defense, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, education, taxes, foreign policy, and the like. I filled it out and was presented with a list of how my views compared with those of the candidates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the top of my list was Harry Browne, a Libertarian Party candidate who scored 89 on a scale of 100. No argument there: I voted for Browne in 1996, and I may do so again, more to express my general outlook on policy than because I really want his finger on the nuclear button. Tied for second were Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch (61), followed by George W. Bush and Steve Forbes, both at 53.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Equally interesting was finding out who would be most likely to cause me to emigrate to Canada should he ever get to the Oval Office. Moving down the list, I learned that I should vote for Donald Trump over Bill Bradley, and that my views would be better represented in the White House by David McReynolds, a Socialist, than by Al Gore. Only Warren Beatty, it seems, is further from my thinking than the vice president. Somehow, this last revelation did not come as a surprise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over at presidentmatch.com, the options are limited to candidates of the two major parties, and after I answered the quiz, I was informed that Alan Keyes and I were made for each other. Next was Steve Forbes, followed by George Bush. Coming in last, the blind date from hell, was none other than Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The main disagreement between the two sites was over the other candidates: selectsmart ranked John McCain better for me than Bill Bradley, while presidentmatch said I should run screaming from McCain, unless the only other option is the guy who invented the Internet. So if the contest comes down to Bradley and McCain, I'll have to flip a coin. Or shoot myself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is all useful information, but it falls short of making the choice as easy as filling out the options you want on a new car, and it could be misleading for anyone who takes it too seriously. The matchmakers pay little attention to some important issues, like the federal budget, missile defense, letting China into the World Trade Organization, and the use of metal bats in baseball (Bush, bless him, would allow wood only).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matters like experience in office get little weight, which makes Forbes and Browne look better than they really are. Temperament and political skills, in which Bush and Bradley might contrast favorably with Gary Bauer or Orrin Hatch, are not considered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason Alan Keyes and I are classified as compatible is that neither President Match nor Select Smart gave me the chance to express my reluctance to vote for someone who appears to be out of his mind. Select Smart put Pat Buchanan in the middle of the pack for me, even though I would sooner pinch Mike Tyson on the bottom than vote for a raving anti-Semite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's something to be said for forcing yourself to contemplate which policies you favor--and for finding out whether the candidate you are drawn to for one reason or another is actually one who would head in the direction you want to go. By focusing on issues of substance, the quizzes are a good antidote to McCain's biography, Bradley's NBA career, Bush's rakish grin, and Gore's . . . well, Gore is probably his own antidote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So if you want to make an intelligent choice in this election, you could do worse than to answer one of these questionnaires. And if you end up voting for Harry Browne, don't blame me.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

That he's ""not qualified."" That the only reason he was appointed is because he's black. In other words, that he's a product of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> or, more precisely, an ""<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, for instance, liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote: ""I believe in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, but I have to acknowledge there are arguments against it. One of the more cogent is the presence of Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Robinson's comment echoes many previous attacks. In 2000, for example, Newsweek columnist Anna Quindlen -- another liberal who has written in support of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> -- declared that Thomas' ""judicial resume was mediocre; he was chosen because he was conservative and black, an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire by an administration that eschewed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many liberal Democrats aren't willing to say out loud what Robinson and Quindlen wrote so clearly. After all, they're conditioned to defend racial preferences, which they insist do not promote ""incompetent"" or ""unqualified"" people. But that doesn't mean they don't think it. Even The American Prospect magazine, a liberal journal that sees its mission as ""beating back the right wing,"" ran an article two years ago calling Thomas the ""most visible <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land, a token black nominee whose lack of qualifications was so painfully outed during his confirmation hearings.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How can you support a policy of racial preferences and then attack one of its supposed beneficiaries as undeserving? This, ultimately, is the intrinsic hypocrisy of the Thomas bashers. They allege that he's not competent and that the only reason he became a Supreme Court justice was because he's black. And in so doing, they level the exact same arguments against Thomas that they castigate conservatives for making about <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> itself. But let's face facts: A program that gives people with a certain skin color an advantage will invariably reward some who would otherwise not qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This blatant intellectual inconsistency does not stop Thomas' liberal critics from accusing him of hypocrisy -- namely, for being the ""most visible <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land"" while simultaneously standing as its most prominent black opponent. By opposing racial preferences, liberals say, Thomas -- who was accepted into Yale Law School via an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program -- is denying others the very same benefits he received.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Thomas reveals in ""My Grandfather's Son,"" his opposition to racial preferences is based on personal conscience and a genuine concern for its effects on black Americans, not selfish disregard for his racial brethren born out of self-loathing, as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> advocates would have it. He writes that he keeps his Yale diploma tucked away in his basement with a 15-cent cigar sticker affixed to its frame. Why? In a ""60 Minutes"" interview, Thomas said ""that degree meant one thing for whites and another thing for blacks. . . . It was discounted.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is one of the tragic legacies of racial preferences -- that the achievements of black people in the professional world will always be suspect, and not just to blacks who benefit from such preferences. In the minds even of liberals, blacks will always be thought of as ""<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hires"" no matter how bright or qualified they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may be difficult for well-intentioned white liberals to understand the personal insecurity that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> causes, and as a white person, I can only take someone like Thomas at his word when he writes about the shame he feels because of racial preferences. But as a gay man, I can certainly empathize, as I imagine I would feel exactly the same way if sexual orientation became a ""plus factor"" in a law school or employment application process. Factoring in a person's immutable traits demeans them and robs them of their individuality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether or not Thomas is qualified to be a Supreme Court justice, who are <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> advocates to smear him as an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire? (Can you imagine a left-wing magazine like The American Prospect saying that about a liberal black judge? It would never happen.) But if they honestly believe Thomas is one, then they only have themselves to blame for a rotten system that privileges some people over others because of skin pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the day his Supreme Court nomination was announced by President George H.W. Bush, Thomas' critics have personally and viciously attacked him as if he were an abstraction -- representing everything they hate about minorities (whether women, gays or blacks) who do not subscribe to their liberal nostrums -- and, in so doing, have sucked him of his humanity as an individual. If liberals want to live up to their self-purported principles of equality and free inquiry, they would do well to stop treating Clarence Thomas as the scapegoat for their political agendas and start treating him like a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:David Suter For The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James Kirchick is on the editorial staff of The New Republic.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

But listen to us. One side pretends to believe that racial discrimination, no matter how rampant and flagrant it used to be, is now ended. Oh, maybe there's a bigot or two in the woodpile, but discrimination as a matter for governmental concern is a thing of the past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other side pretends to believe that only racists who oppose minority progress could be against <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Discrimination a thing of the past indeed! A black man in America still hasn't got a chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each side knows (but feels no urge to acknowledge) that there is at least some justice to the other's position. The blatant segregation and discrimination are largely over. Law now forbids such racism, and -- I really do believe -- public opinion won't countenance it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But racial fairness (in some instances, in some arenas) still eludes us. Corporate management and directorships, legal and accountancy partnerships, and even concern for the plight of our children clearly are not distributed on the sole basis of deservedness. Race matters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truth is complicated and inconsistent and hard to figure out. Instead of undertaking the effort to figure it out, we draw the lines as starkly as we can and force the public to choose one incomplete reality (ours, we hope) and reject the other side's partial truth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It happens not just in our race relations but throughout our politics. It even happens in our courts, as when the clever Barry Scheck deliberately cut out any middle-gray consideration in the trial of Louise Woodward, the British au pair. Force the jury to choose between the cold-blooded murder of an innocent child and innocence (or at least reasonable doubt), he thought, and surely there won't be a conviction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His now-famous miscalculation (he was in court this week trying to reinstate the grays) might serve as a lesson to us all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it might show us the wisdom of changing the terms of the debate. Much of what I'm saying, I admit, is based on my belief that most Americans want to be fair and want our important institutions to reflect that fairness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't believe there are significant, politically influential segments of the society that are happy over the fact that African American admissions at Boalt Hall, the University of California-Berkeley's law school, are down 80 percent as a direct result of Proposition 209's ban on racial preference, or that the first-year class has but a single black member. I don't believe there are large pockets of secret jubilation that a similar trend is in evidence at the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, though, I doubt that many <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> supporters -- including the beleaguered Bill Lee -- want to parcel out society's goodies on the basis of racial entitlement. Many of us may defend, but few of us are thrilled by, voting districts drawn purely on the basis of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We want (is this hopelessly naive?) the same thing: a society in which gifts and grit and character matter more than pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what are we fighting about? Mainly, I think, about how to produce such a society. Some of us believe that the best way to achieve a colorblind future is to practice colorblindness now. And some of us believe that colorblindness after centuries of racism will merely lock in white advantage -- that we need to level the playing field before insisting on a single set of rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I remember when black quarterbacks were a rarity in the National Football League -- when the most talented collegiate passers were, if they were black, switched to defensive back or running back or some such. Then a couple of coaches broke the mold -- <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>? -- and then a couple more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the six starting quarterbacks (out of 30 NFL teams) constitute parity? Wrong question. What is true is that there is, at last, reason for young black athletes to believe they can go as far, at any position, as their talent takes them. As Gene Washington, a black front office executive with the league, told a reporter:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""What's most interesting to me is that I don't notice it.

On a morning walk, tour guide Karl Walter is moving toward more contemporary events.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the walls of Old Jaffa came down in the late 1800s, people started moving to the countryside, he said. Muslims went in one direction, Christians in another. The Jews went north, to a few plots of sand on which they built a school and some houses and started what would become Tel Aviv  --  the first modern Jewish city and a destination for the earliest waves of Zionist immigrants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The city celebrates its centennial this year, its role in the nation changed from point of arrival for emigres to notorious party town and cultural and financial hub  --  a bit Manhattan, a bit L.A., a bit Ibiza, as a morning-to-dusk-to-dawn walk will show.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are those who consider it a fulfillment of Theodore Herzl's early Zionist vision  --  a Jewish city, yes, but one that has a strong bohemian streak, that's creative, tolerant and wide open in its politics. There are others who see it as a bit of an abomination, removed from the daily sense of conflict that runs through cities such as Jerusalem and a place, as one Israeli columnist called it, of ""mass Shabbat desecration.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 400,000 people live in the city proper. But close to half of the country's 7 million people live in Tel Aviv's suburbs or nearby coastal towns, so the dichotomy is a reflection not just of the city but of Israel itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tel Aviv  --  where David Ben-Gurion declared the Jewish state's independence  --  has seen its share of violence, including suicide bombings and Scud missiles launched by Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the southern Tel Aviv waterfront, Walter pointed out the stone house that used to belong to one of Jaffa's Arab leaders. It's in a field where, he said, Jewish forces converged in a battle on the eve of Ben-Gurion's declaration. The house is now a museum.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the Arab families were forced out or fled to the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and elsewhere. A few thousand remained, their descendants clustered in Jaffa neighborhoods that have since been incorporated into a combined municipality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as city conservation director Jeremie Hoffman said, the frame of reference is often different here than in other parts of Israel. Tel Aviv residents are as apt to identify with what's happening in New York and Paris as they are with the small towns of Israel, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hoffman's work is a case in point. In a country defined in some ways by ancient disputes, he is trying to preserve architecture that is only a few decades old  --  the Bauhaus apartments built by immigrants who imported the style from Europe in the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's mid-afternoon, and Hoffman is strolling through downtown neighborhoods where the city has imposed strict rules on renovating hundreds of Bauhaus buildings. The United Nations has designated the area a heritage zone. Apartments that once housed new arrivals are now million-dollar investments. This is not where the new immigrants come anymore  --  it is a second or third step, Hoffman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yael Dayan, chairman of the City Council, said rising property values are on her mind a lot lately. There's discussion of rent-control laws to ensure the city remains affordable for young people starting their careers as well as middle-class families.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She sips a late-afternoon coffee near Rabin Square, where Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995. The world's focus more often rests on Jerusalem, she said, but she's among those who will tell you that Tel Aviv is the heart of Israel's story.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This was Herzl's idea of what the Jewish land should be  --  secular, liberal, pluralistic,"" she said, citing the city's efforts to boost welfare benefits, care for the homeless, and encourage tolerance toward gays and other minorities. She winces a bit when asked about the status of Tel Aviv's Arab citizens, though she said the city has <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies for hiring Israeli Arabs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Tel Aviv is seen as very left-wing, but it keeps its distance,"" Arab mayoral candidate Asma Agbarieh-Zahalka said during her campaign. Redevelopment of some of Jaffa's older neighborhoods, she said, risked gentrifying the few Arab sections that remain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She did not receive many votes, but one person who supported her was writer Avner Bernheimer, who felt putting an Arab woman in charge of the city might stir things up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is just past sundown on Friday night, the start of the Jewish Sabbath. Jerusalem and other more conservative towns are locked up tight to observe the day of rest. In Tel Aviv, it's the start of a party that will run into the early hours.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bernheimer and his partner, architect Eran Neuman, are talking over dinner about their projects. Bernheimer is writing a television movie about human trafficking through the Sinai desert. Neuman has put together one of the centennial celebration's centerpiece displays, a futuristic look at Tel Aviv in which ideas from architecture schools worldwide are pictured on brightly lit, inflatable triangles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But some of the most animated talk over dinner is of their  3-month-old son  --  the mother is a college friend of Neuman's, and Bernheimer is the biological father. Just as it was built on refugees from Europe, they say, Tel Aviv today is a result of its openness  --  to gays, to people with different ideas about politics or art, to those with ambitions they feel they can fulfill here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Friday night becomes Saturday morning. There are discos, clubs and bars tucked into so many alleys. People line up for the most popular.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the Blackbook, two men in NBA jerseys and Elvis wigs are waving sex toys in the face of an unfortunate friend celebrating a birthday.

Recent anti-Semitic incidents spurred the regents to want to take action, but at their Sept. 17 meeting, they chose not to adopt proposed ""principles against intolerance."" Instead, they created a committee to consider the issue anew. The reality, however, is that the chance of a breakthrough is low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Any written policy would need to achieve conflicting goals: expressing a strong commitment to freedom of speech as an integral aspect of education, while seeking to prevent speech that is racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. The trick is in setting the border between heated, even inflammatory, speech and hate speech, which is notoriously difficult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court long has held that vague speech rules violate the 1st Amendment and deny due process of law. In fact, efforts at defining hate speech by other state universities have been declared unconstitutional on vagueness grounds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Michigan, for example, adopted a code in the 1980s -- later struck down by the Supreme Court -- that prohibited ""any behavior, verbal or physical, that stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-era veteran status.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what does it mean to ""stigmatize"" or ""victimize""? If a professor or student agues that there are inherent differences between men and women, does that violate the policy? Can advocacy of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> be deemed to violate this policy because it stigmatizes racial minorities by assuming that they need preferential treatment to compete?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with principles of intolerance, activists on UC campuses are urging the Board of Regents to adopt the State Department definition of anti-Semitism, which includes trying to ""demonize Israel,"" ""delegitimize Israel"" or applying a ""double-standard to Israel."" But who is fit to judge when criticism of Israel's policies and actions veers into demonization? If a student states that Palestinians should have a right of return, is she seeking to delegitimize Israel or just airing a controversial opinion? What if she says the country's founding was a mistake?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the 1st Amendment, there is no such thing as a false idea and all viewpoints may be expressed. The 1st Amendment even protects the right to deny the Holocaust or advocate the subjugation of a supposedly inferior group. There unquestionably is a 1st Amendment right to argue against (or for) the existence of Israel or to contend that it should meet (or not have to meet) higher standards of human rights than other nations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These difficulties have led some campuses to take a softer approach: adopting community speech guidelines or principles, while pledging not to punish those who violate those principles. Campus administrators can feel that they are taking positive actions without fearing constitutional challenges. Also, they can remind students that just because there is a 1st Amendment right to say something, that doesn't mean it should be said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But such middleground policies always seem to leave everyone dissatisfied. Those who want to prevent hate speech see them as toothless or ineffectual because they cannot be enforced. Those who are most concerned about protecting freedom of expression on campus still worry that they will chill speech and inhibit discussion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is there a solution to all of this? Is there anything the regents committee and other universities can try?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My advice would be to draft a policy that focuses on reaffirming the importance of free expression while defining what is not constitutionally protected. There is no 1st Amendment right to threaten or harass another person or to deface someone else's property.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The policy should not seek to inhibit or limit protected speech, no matter how offensive it might be. The policy should seek to define, with as much precision as possible, what types of speech and conduct cross the line and are impermissible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should also remember that universities have the right to free speech too, and can and should speak out against inflammatory speech that targets members of the university community. This, of course, is consistent with the educational mission of universities and a basic principle of the 1st Amendment: the best remedy for the speech we dislike is more speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Erwin Chemerinsky is the dean of the UC Irvine School of Law.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Being a Chicagoan whose tax dollars helped purchase the microphones, transmitters and speakers via which these hateful, hurtful words have been broadcast, being a Chicagoan whose taxes evidently pay the wages of bigots, that's injury added to the insult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once again, Chicago has been rocked by charges that some of its firefighters aren't comfortable serving many of the people who live here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The five racist radio transmissions of recent weeks have generated more shock than surprise. The transmissions didn't occur in a void. They follow more than three decades of tension within the department since its ranks were belatedly integrated in 1968.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of that tension over the years has stayed within the city's firehouses. On rare occasion, citizens have been able to peer inside, or to listen from afar. What they've seen and heard isn't always ennobling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1997, a videotape surfaced depicting a 1990 firehouse retirement party at which firefighters were drinking, exposing themselves and uttering racial slurs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the firefighters who attended the party, James McNally, now is president of Chicago Fire Fighters Union Local 2. On another occasion, he appeared in black face to protest promotions motivated by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not to say most Chicago firefighters condone racism. But firefighters--provocateurs and innocents alike--do need to appreciate how grave these five radio incidents are, as is the delivery of a death threat to a battalion chief who heads the African American Fire Fighters League of Chicago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are times, particularly when the offenders are young or ignorant, when ugly behavior can be forgiven if not forgotten, when its perpetrators can be redeemed if not encouraged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not one of those times. This behavior, in this department, in this city, is intolerable. There is no wellspring of goodwill upon which an offending firefighter can call, no margin for middling penance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Simply put, these disgusting, dehumanizing incidents follow too much history. Fire Commissioner James Joyce declared last week that ""offenses like these will be fireable offenses."" Translation: Joyce has committed himself to judging each case individually, but he has put every one of his employees on notice that the range of penalties unquestionably includes dismissal. Mayor Richard Daley concurred, stating that a still unidentified person--thought to be a firefighter--who voiced racial slurs broadcast March 1 should admit his action and face the ""ultimate consequences.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is the correct response. When these kinds of calculated affronts to city and department policy occur, when reasonable citizens are left to wonder about the integrity of the firefighters they employ, jobs should--must--be on the line.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But whether Joyce can fulfill his own prophecy is another matter. The department terminated seven firefighters who appeared in the 1990 videotape. They challenged the dismissals before an arbitrator and eventually won back their jobs--with pension and seniority rights, the department says, although without four years of back pay.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Merely identifying whoever has been spewing filth on fire department frequencies isn't easy. One veteran firefighter who voiced racist slander, and a supervisor who didn't react properly, have been suspended over the first of the five incidents. It's likely the subsequent transmissions originated on fire department radios, but in this era of clever hackers and electronic gadgetry, the department isn't yet certain that no outsider is involved. Joyce, though, hasn't sounded like a boss who expects to learn that his own employees are innocent. Last week he denounced an ""underground Web site"" that offered firefighters tips on how to obscure their identities when transmitting over department frequencies. ""That's what we're up against,"" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's also up against an unmeasured amount of denial over society's gradual progress on race. Many of today's Chicago firefighters did come of age in a department culture that to varying degrees rewarded three attributes: skill, courage and clout. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span>, though, is about a fourth, and to some foreign, attribute: fairness. It's understandable, if not admirable, that adding fairness to the mix caused resentment among those who feel that the long-overdue accelerated promotion of minorities--a cause Joyce has advanced--is unfair to some whites who don't get those promotions. What's not understandable is for any Chicago firefighter to permit that or any other frustration to be voiced in the most vicious bigotry imaginable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Firefighters who don't share that bigotry are now in the best position to lead the department out of its difficult past. One important step is to help nail the perpetrators of the radio incidents. Public racism tends to be a team sport. It's likely someone inside or outside the department knows who originated these broadcasts. Stepping forward with that knowledge may require even more courage than racing into a burning house.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But restoring the department's integrity, like rescuing fire victims, is a critical public service. And that cause, public service, should be key to how this sorry drama concludes. Any firefighter who merely wants to fight fire is free to resign and join the U.S. Forest Service. Any firefighter who wants to serve the public--in all its varied hues, in its wide range of good and bad behaviors, in its terrible moments when disaster strikes and panic ensues--is welcome to stay.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, if a firefighter finds himself risking his own life to save the lives of Chicagoans he finds unworthy of his respect, he should find another job. Fire Commissioner Joyce is right to pursue those few who've let that lack of respect get the best of them. The hope here is that he will root them out, adjudicate their cases under the due process to which they're entitled--and subject them to the ultimate consequences Mayor Daley properly threatened last week.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

It would be nice if CEO Peter Bijur would now lob a few bons mots at journalistic sanctimony, although this seems unlikely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we can still enjoy the larger point: There was a time when journalists aspired to the sensibility of novelists, to some semblance of psychological depth, rather than running around like salivating trolls playing ""gotcha."" This would have been an excellent opportunity for that earlier breed to assert themselves, given the gift of the tapes -- a fly-on-the-wall peek at real life that every journalist dreams of.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But of course the ""n"" word has become such a taboo, the mere rumor of its utterance becomes a salacious story by itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this case another hackneyed stereotype was thrown into the mix -- EVIL BUSINESSMEN -- and a whole seven-day news conflagration was built on a lie. The transcripts provided by the attorneys, of course, were abysmal. But even the transcripts make it clear that Mr. Ulrich is referring to everyone at Texaco as jelly beans, regardless of color: ""You can't have just `we' and `them.' You can't just have black jelly beans and other jelly beans. It doesn't work.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jelly beans were in the air at Texaco: On an earlier bit of tape, Mr. Lundwall is heard saying ""yum"" and offering a female colleague a jelly bean. (She declines.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even more amazing was the failure to draw on the depth of insight available from the tapes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They were secretly recorded by a participant whose motives remain a mystery: Richard Lundwall, a manager in the finance department, was subsequently let go; his tapes seem to consist of random incidents from a day in the life Texaco. We hear him straightening out the matter of a departed employee who may have swiped a laptop. We hear him waxing lyrical over the filet mignon at the Texaco cafeteria. We hear him making nondescript phone calls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But most of all, we peer into his department as it wrestles with conflicting goals that should have sent journalistic synapses firing in all directions, awakening the slumbering cognitive organ: downsizing and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the tapes make clear over and over, Texaco's finance department was being prodded from on high to reduce costs by getting rid of bodies. ""We shrink very systematically,"" one manager is heard saying. ""We absorb the job and do a lot of crosstraining."" In another instance: ""Everybody who leaves, leaves with a smile on their face"" -- referring to the effort to coax people out the door with early retirement and generous severance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We also hear survivors comparing their lot with those who left, including some who jumped to Wall Street. This prompts a discussion about the relative advantages of packing your lifetime earnings into a few stress-laden, workaholic years or spreading them out over a 30-year career of easy hours at Texaco.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But along with downsizing, the department was being pushed to upsize minority and female representation. At one point Mr. Lundwall suggests recruiting at ""Howard or Temple or [other] predominantly black schools"" where students are allowed to advance ""simply on the basis of scholastic merit."" Other MBA programs, he says, are ""under the same gun as corporations"" to promote by quota.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it bothered anybody to be firing colleagues while recruiting minorities, it doesn't show. But there is evidence of stress over race within the organization -- far more interesting and reliable evidence than an indecipherable word that some self-interested lawyer claims is ""nigger.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lundwall jokes about wearing his Viking hat during National Odin Month -- ""I'm celebrating my heritage."" Then he and Mr. Ulrich riff about the ""black"" national anthem, which evidently some Texaco employees had sung at a company event the previous year. Mr. Lundwall says, ""When they sat during `ours' -- listen to me, during `ours,' as though they're not included -- and stood for their modified one, I apologize to nobody for walking out of there.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What follows is a series of inaudible mumbles and gaps in the recording, out of which supposedly emerged the offensive comment by Mr. Ulrich. But the tone is jocular rather than angry. Elsewhere, Mr. Ulrich can be heard reviewing employment records and remarking with satisfaction on the advancement of women and minorities. And in a discussion of how to talk prospective downsizees out the door, Mr. Ulrich comes across rather well -- sensitive yet realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The press might have thrown this evidence onto the scale when weighing whether ""nunjunah"" was really ""nigger.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Calls around Texaco last week didn't find anybody willing to say, on the record or off, what sort of guy Mr. Ulrich was, even though Mr. Bijur and the rest worked side by side with him for years. Their desire to duck this question was not hard to fathom: If Mr. Ulrich were a hardened racist, they should have booted him out long ago. If he were a decent guy, defending him now would violate the first rule of post-Tylenol crisis management, which is never defend yourself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, having scored this slamdunk over various Interfaith Councils for Decrying Big Business, the company blithers that the tapes are still ""troubling."" But Texaco must live in the world, and will certainly cough up generously to settle the lawsuit and become exemplary for its ""diversity"" programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the rest of us, we might conclude that senior executives of Big Oil are honestly at sea over ""diversity"" -- as these tapes clearly reveal -- no less than anyone else is. The muckraking publication Sales & Marketing Management recently pointed out to its readers that ""African-Americans confront stereotypes that make it difficult for them to sell to [white] customers."" Who could doubt it? And yet the same presumably liberal California voters who plumped heavily for Bill Clinton last week also decided that racial preferences are the wrong solution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the honest uncertainty, perhaps we should accept that there is more to human dignity than twisting ourselves into pretzels of ""sensitivity."" And keeping a few old goats around at Texaco who remember when the business of an oil company was finding oil, not color-coding jelly beans, may not be such a bad thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: On the Basis of Merit Only"" -- WSJ Nov. 19, 1996)</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

Things happen. Hillsides erupt. Trends emerge. New stars are born, as old ones are escorted to the quiz shows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Change is the one constant of California life, or so sing the gilded poets. And yet at times it seems nothing ever changes at all. Like the poppies, certain plot lines keep coming back again and again, the perennials of the public scene. Like the smog, some never go away at all. Water is one obvious example.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The generals of hydraulics are at it again, warring this time over Colorado River water. The stakes, as always, are huge and the details, as always, are complex. The fundamental issue, though, is the same as always: Water, water, who gets the water? There never has been, and never will be, enough water for California--except when it floods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, the politics of the place adhere to familiar patterns. From the earliest days, California vote-seekers have campaigned against the Other. In the mid-1800s, it was ""John,"" code name for the Chinese laborers. There were the Pikes, followed by the Okies, and the Hollywood Reds, and the welfare queens, and Mexican field workers, and the beneficiaries of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Does anyone doubt that, given the mounting political ruckus over the Asian connection, the next election will be a contest to determine which candidates know the fewest Chinese?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This sense of repetition can be annoying to journalists. News is supposed to be a self-defining term, but after the 10th dog is bitten by a boy, the headlines can feel a little too familiar. Cynicism begins to invade the journalistic immune system, a dangerous development in that the truly cynical journalist is but one bad day away from a second career as press agent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All that said, it still seems not at all difficult to imagine what headlines await Californians beyond that bridge to the New Millennium. Five years from now--or 10, 15, 25, even 50 years from now--the news will be full of water wars and wedge issues and O.J. Simpson's new quarters at the rest home. B-1 Bob Dornan, or his lawful heirs, will be demanding a recount. Jerry Brown will be rumored to be contemplating a run for something, anything. Peter Ueberroth will be rumored to be a candidate for a job he doesn't want.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A seismic engineer will be expressing concern about the L.A. Coliseum press box. Tunneling for the Metro Red Line will be stalled somewhere under the city. A California councilman will be shown amid the scorched rubble of a canyon, declaring the time has come to crack down on roof shingles. A county supervisor will visit a submerged subdivision, declaring the time has come to crack down on flood plain development. Los Angeles will be fighting over its police chief.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Dodgers will need a third baseman. Al Davis will be threatening to move his Fort Worth Raiders to Frankfurt. Food critics will be predicting that Los Angeles cuisine finally is about to come of age. Sylvester Stallone will announce he is now seeking serious roles. And Liz Taylor will be home from Cedars, weakened by the operation, but holding up well for a 145-year-old.

That every spring the feature writers return on schedule to San Juan Capistrano is somehow reassuring. It was comforting to read the other day in the Fresno Bee that San Joaquin Valley raisin growers are about to embark on yet another promotional campaign. Their conviction that the world is but one catchy advertisement away from succumbing to raisin mania has been a staple of reportage in raisinland since William Saroyan was a boy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some never-ending stories, however, grow tedious, as unwelcome as weeds. Tales of the latest gang to terrorize the streets, or the latest crackpot to invade the family planning clinic, or the latest measurement of public school decline--any novelty wore off sad old chestnuts such as these long ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, new crops do keep pushing up. Politicians in particular are adept at developing the fresh controversies that news requires. Currently in the state Capitol, debate rages over gambling and how to control card rooms and reservation casinos. This story line holds tremendous evergreen potential, as all sides seem willing to throw huge amounts of cash at the legislators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As long as combatants are willing to donate, politicians will be willing to debate their issue, on and on, but without conclusion.

6580ab64459a9ec6fcc653b3	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1774364135.xml.txt	"<div><p>Affirmative action for conservatives?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even though we are conservative professors, we've argued publicly that conservative attacks on universities are too often overheated and counterproductive. Nonetheless, liberals shouldn't pretend that academia is untouched by political prejudices. Conservatives do face some bias and are wildly underrepresented in the social sciences; enough, perhaps, to warrant new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a recent study, only 6.6% of professors in the social sciences self-identify as Republicans (compared with 24.2% in business, 23.3% in engineering, and 22.9% in the health sciences). In sociology, Marxists outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1. Conservative professors are, then, less well represented in the social sciences than women and people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This imbalance is partly attributable to the fact that conservative students steer clear of the social sciences well before they consider graduate programs. One study found that students' politics is among the very best predictors of their undergraduate major choice, with conservatives tending to select the natural sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's possible that these conservative undergraduates simply prefer the natural sciences -- some evidence, for example, suggests that they are slightly more focused on financial success than are liberals. But it's also germane that conservatives feel uncomfortable in classes that touch on politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A climate survey conducted by the University of Colorado found that Republican students were more than three times as likely as their Democratic peers to feel intimidated when sharing their political ideas in class. Another study found that students active in campus conservative groups avoid coursework in the social sciences -- an especially striking discovery given these students' self-evidently strong interest in social and political issues. A third study found that conservatives report less satisfaction with their coursework in the social sciences than do liberal students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've also found that right-leaning PhD students seem to avoid the most politicized subfields in the social sciences. One young political scientist, for example, told us that she would have preferred to study the Middle East, but opted for a safer subfield instead: ""I didn't do the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which was the thing I wanted to do."" As one professor of the ancient world -- a safe subfield in history -- explained more generally: ""If you're a conservative, there [are] such huge no-go zones.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one exception -- that proves the rule -- is economics. Economics has a long history of openness to thinkers on both sides of the political divide and is the one social science field that actually looks like America; it has roughly equal proportions of professors who identify as Republicans, independents and Democrats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Academic sorting is especially troubling given that the university is one of the only institutions that could model civil discourse for young people in our polarized age, an example that is hard to provide with so few conservatives about. Additionally, a growing number of social scientists are recognizing that political homogeneity makes it hard for humanistic disciplines to converge on the best approximation of the truth; homogenous fields not only generate a narrower range of research interests and interpretations, they are also plagued by confirmation bias -- our tendency to accept findings and theories that fit our assumptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One liberal argument for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is sympathetic to these very points. In his 1978 opinion on Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. noted that truth is discovered ""out of a multitude of tongues."" (He was quoting an earlier decision on another topic.) If Justice Powell is right -- if the primary purpose of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is to increase the variety of tongues -- then we should increase conservative ones too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some might reasonably object that the real purpose of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is to remedy historical discrimination. Universities, however, have long emphasized the virtues of diversity over remedial justice. In fact, liberals embraced the diversity rationale in the 1970s partly because it allowed them to extend <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> to new groups -- especially women -- with far weaker historical grievances than African Americans. Today, universities are so committed to diversity -- not remedial justice -- that they are now practicing <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for men so that their campuses don't become even more dominated by female students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity is now the new religion of the university -- and it's one they could practice much better. We don't endorse preferences in graduate admissions and hiring. At a bare minimum, however, universities should stop barring conservative speakers from their campuses. In just the past year, for example, Williams College disinvited two conservative speakers from its ""uncomfortable learning"" series.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In hiring committees, liberal faculty might also question their natural preference for like-minded colleagues. (Progressive professors often say that they prefer to hire liberals, all else being equal.) Before they start sorting through resumes, departments might consider advertising positions in fields that are more popular among conservatives, such as military history, political history, the American founding, sociology of religion and natural law. Scholars in such fields would bring some balance to a curriculum increasingly dominated by race and gender. Finally, universities could grant visiting appointments in conservative thought, an experiment already underway at the University of Colorado.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even these modest reforms should help conservative feel much more welcome in all of academia, not just in some of its quarters. When that happens, the university will also deepen its public legitimacy -- an increasingly rare and fragile good in our polarized age. But that fine achievement depends critically on liberals. As conservative professors, we have defended the progressive university against its polemical right-wing critics. Now we are asking the university to better practice what it preaches.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jon A.

In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

And America's. But what might an Obama victory mean for African-Americans in particular? Should we expect his administration to play a major role in black group advancement?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than a century, black civic leaders have tangled over whether to pursue economic independence or focus their energies on integrating political, corporate and educational institutions. W.E.B. Du Bois, author of the groundbreaking 1903 treatise, ""The Souls of Black Folk,"" argued for the latter, while his contemporary, Booker T. Washington, said ""political activity alone"" was not the answer. In addition, insisted Washington, ""you must have property, industry, skill, economy, intelligence and character.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the 1960s, the black civil-rights leadership has sided with Du Bois. Between 1970 and 2001, the number of black elected officials in the U.S. grew from fewer than 1,500 to more than 9,000. And while impressive socioeconomic progress has been made, wide black-white gaps remain in educational achievement, homeownership rates, labor-force participation, income levels and other measures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor should we conclude that civil-rights laws are responsible for the black progress that has occurred. For example, up until the 1950s, and in an era of open and rampant racial discrimination, the jobless rate for blacks was much lower than today and similar to that of whites in the same age group. In fact, blacks had higher labor-force participation rates than whites in every Census taken between 1890 and 1950. And in the decades preceding the 1960s -- that is, prior to the passage of landmark civil-rights bills and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> legislation -- there were sharp rises in black educational achievement, both absolutely and relative to whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economist Thomas Sowell has spent decades researching racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. and abroad. And his findings -- in books like ""Race and Culture: A World View,"" ""Affirmative Action Around the World"" and ""Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?"" -- show that political activity generally has not been a factor in the rise of groups from poverty to prosperity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Germans came to the U.S. as indentured servants during colonial times. And while working to pay off the cost of the voyage they studiously avoided participation in politics. Only after they'd risen economically did Germans begin seeking public office, culminating with the election of presidents Hoover and Eisenhower.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern can be found among Chinese populations in southeast Asia, the Caribbean and the U.S. In Argentina, where English minorities have done well financially and played a major role in the development of the economy, they've played almost no role in Argentine politics. And so it goes with Italians in the the U.S. and Jews in Britain: In both places economic gains have generally preceded political gains. ""Empirically, political activity and political success have been neither necessary nor sufficient for economic advancement,"" writes Mr. Sowell. ""Nor has eager political participation or outstanding success in politics translated into faster group achievement.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans might keep in mind that in those rare instances where the political success of a minority group has come first, it has often resulted in slower socioeconomic progress. The Irish immigrants who came to the U.S. in the mid-19th century hailed from a country where 80% of the population was rural. Yet they settled in industrial centers like New York, Philadelphia and Boston and took low-skill jobs. Their rise from poverty was especially slow -- as late as 1920, 80% of all Irish women working in America were domestic servants -- despite the fact that Irish-run political organizations dominated many big-city governments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The Irish were fiercely loyal to each other, electing, appointing and promoting their own kind,"" writes Mr. Sowell. ""This had little effect on the average Irish American, who began to reach economic prosperity in the 20th century at about the same time when the Irish political machines began to decline.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If elected, Mr. Obama may well turn out to be a competent president, even an admirable one. But history gives us no indication that his political success will translate into black upward mobility. And given Mr. Obama's liberal leanings, there's every reason to believe that current obstacles to black progress will remain in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The candidate favors minimum-wage laws, for example, on the assumption that they help lift people out of poverty. But most poor people already earn more than the minimum wage. And most people who earn the minimum wage aren't poor. Minimum-wage laws are more likely to price people out of the labor market, especially younger and less educated workers, a large number of whom happen to be black. Today's economy places a premium on skills. If young people can't get an entry-level job because an artificial federal wage floor has made them too expensive to hire, they can't gain the skills and experience to move up the economic ladder.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take another example: Mr. Obama opposes educational choice, which will also have a negative impact on poor blacks, who tend to be the ones stuck in America's worst public schools. Mr. Obama opposes school vouchers that would allow low-income black parents to send their children to the type of private school where he sends his own daughters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both cases, the only ""change"" that Mr. Obama would be bringing the Oval Office is the color of the person perpetrating bad policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Riley is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

The growing number of jobs lost to this crafty creature that seems to be nowhere and everywhere at once is startling enough to make us question our assumptions about how to plan a future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the goal was once to ensure a college education for everyone, the more prudent policy now might be to help people develop skills related to outdoor work and other physically demanding jobs. Chatbots can write, but they can't change a lightbulb. They can't plumb a house. They can't heal the sick with a human touch or grow vegetables or perform countless other jobs that fill humanity's most crucial needs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the confused, ""GPT"" stands for ""generative pre-trained transformer,"" which refers to how ChatGPT processes, requests and formulates responses.

Something like that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the reasoning behind the high court's 6-3 decision on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is best left to lawyers - speaking of replaceable professions - the implications of the explosive expansion of AI into new arenas should be obvious to anyone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During a visit with my son, I brought up the subject of AI, and he quickly begged for a subject change.

A writer with a law degree, he depends on regular clients to earn a living. He's fine for now, thanks to his unique niche, but other writers similarly situated have lost their entire client lists overnight. Post tech reporters Pranshu Verma and Gerrit De Vynck recently described a Bloomingdale, Ill., writer, Eric Fein, whose clients - all of them - notified him that they were ""transitioning"" to AI. Is anyone not transitioning these days?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fein has returned to school to become an HVAC technician. Another displaced writer, this one in San Francisco, has started a job as a dog walker.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amid the disruption, irony remains fully employed. Is technology, in replacing humans, also making us more human? More time spent outdoors is surely healthier than sitting at a desk for hours a day. If more people turn to skilled labor, might we finally be able to find dependable help on household troubles beyond our ken?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A forthcoming ""wearable AI assistant"" from a company called Humane is meant to revolutionize both technology and humanity. Imran Chaudhri, Humane's co-founder and chairman, describes his pocket-size invention as intentionally humanizing, because it eliminates the need for devices - smart phones, watches, even computers - that act as barriers to human interaction. Chaudhri's device performs the functions of all the above and more, using the palm of the hand as a display screen so your face is free to express emotions, make eye contact and, not least, see where you're going.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such developments are both frightening and exhilarating. The possibilities for liberation and creativity are limited only by the imagination. But the threat to life as we know it - and especially to white-collar (or work-at-home-hoodie) jobs - is potentially catastrophic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the bright side, AI isn't always so smart. Or, rather, it's smart in a Vulcan way. All brain, no emotion, makes for a lousy human. Writers can be replaced if all you need is a user manual, but AI doesn't have the emotional depth or experiential memory to write beautifully, using just the right word or nuance. An algorithm might come up with the likeliest word used by most people most of the time, but a good writer knows better ones. Voice and style are as individual as a fingerprint.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least one of Fein's clients has realized that his content was better than AI's and has returned. Others decided that the quality sacrifice was worth the cost savings. Humans, after all, need steady salaries and health benefits, vacations, sick days and family leave. AI needs nothing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can't at this point see exactly how AI might evolve. We know instinctively that the good often is shadowed by the bad. How many ways will we regret our eager embrace of machine over man? Of such is science fiction written, though I suspect AI would be a lousy author. Great literature comes to us from people who have dug deep into their psyches, experiences, sorrows, triumphs, fears, losses and aspirations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do wonder about all the folks who no longer will be admitted to colleges and universities because they don't meet certain data-driven standards and, therefore, won't have the opportunity to study humankind's greatest achievements.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The immediate losers will be the students of color who might have benefited from <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. But in the longer run, the real loser might well be academia. Young men already have abandoned college in huge numbers, leaving women to dominate in many fields that AI loves. Add Black and Brown young people to decreasing enrollments and who's left? And who will teach? AI, I'm afraid.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court says <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> belongs to another generation and is no longer needed. It would be nice to think so, but my hunch is that many Americans would agree with Suzanne Szostak, co-innkeeper of Mine + Farm, my favorite getaway here in Sonoma County.

Never mind that a majority of Texans like being American citizens; these freedom-fighters aren't big on the fine print of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over three decades, the HRA bombs bars in Austin and Houston, killing about 500 civilians, including (accidents will happen) scores of Mexican immigrants. Its members murder state and federal judges, and any fellow Latinos caught ""collaborating"" with Texas state troopers, including caterers and garbage men. They assassinate over 300 policemen. When Washington activates the National Guard to keep the peace, 700 American servicemen wind up in boxes. And while most decent, hard-working Latinos in Texas don't support the HRA, they also don't mind all the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> coming their way since the ruckus started.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Airport novels must constantly raise the stakes, so we can't have the HRA constraining itself to Texas. Equipped by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, the HRA bombs Wall Street, causing billions of dollars in damage. In fact, the World Trade Center bombing of 1992 could easily be the work of these militants. They mortar-bomb the White House, and make unnervingly near-successful assassination attempts on both Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is the American public enraged? Quite the opposite: It's bored. Another bombing in El Paso? Big deal. Texas seems far away, and a thorn in the side. Maybe it would be a relief to shed the place, which doesn't even generate much oil revenue anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here the plot may take a turn toward the far-fetched: The sitting U.S. president -- let's call him Bartlet -- initiates a ""peace process."" Laborious negotiations ensue involving the federal government, the Texas chapters of the Democratic and Republican parties, a political front for the HRA, and Mexico. (As to why the U.S. would negotiate with a foreign country over a state in the union, just suspend your disbelief.) Charitably, the HRA offers to refrains from blowing up bars or assassinating presidents. At last they hammer out a deal, to international celebration. No more carnage!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not the end of the story, because ""peace"" doesn't come cheap. Texas is still a star in Old Glory, but the American flag is put out of view in public places lest it alienate Hispanics. A complex bureaucratic apparatus now links Austin and Mexico City to coordinate social policy. President Bartlet doesn't dare sneeze in Texas without asking the Mexican president's permission, and all statements in relation to the Lone Star state are issued jointly with the Mexican government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It gets weirder: Every HRA sniper and bomber that the FBI apprehended gets to go home, though many have just started life sentences. Picture a swarthier Timothy McVeigh -- who in our page-turner walks off death row a free man, met by a cheering crowd and a pitcher of margarita. The Texas state police force, which did so much to keep the HRA from killing even more people than it did, is drastically downsized and renamed. Made to feel ashamed, droves of experienced anti-terrorist officers retire early. A powerful police ombudsman is imported from Mexico, as is an ""oversight commissioner"" from France. Americans can no longer be trusted to run their own police.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most painfully, HRA leaders are ushered into Texas state government, and a self-confessed HRA commander is awarded the post of commissioner of education. The Texas governor says he can tolerate working with murderers on only one condition: The HRA must destroy at least some of its 100-ton illegal arsenal, which it has kept for a rainy day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, does Mr. Bartlet get tough? No, the president of the U.S. grovels. With no promises from the HRA on disarmament (its representatives have proposed how they might theoretically disarm, but not when), he promises to withdraw the National Guard from Texas and to dismantle its outposts. He announces an amnesty for HRA men on the lam, giving about 60 desperadoes a clean record. He promises the secessionist leadership that convicted felons can infiltrate the Texas police force, and serve on its supervisory board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this happens even though a new dissident group is bombing D.C. again. (The ""Real"" HRA comprises disaffected HRA members who still think -- and you can see why, with such an accommodating federal government -- that they can win Texas by force.) Mr. Bartlet dangles the possibility of disbanding the FBI's Domestic Counter-Terrorism Program, which HRA people despise because it's been so effective at catching them red-handed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You seem skeptical. Let killers out of jail, having served only one or two years? Not in the U.S. of A! Convicted murderers in the police, supervising police operations? As if! Decisions on the National Guard and FBI made solely on the basis of demands by a bunch of unelected terrorists? A ridiculous book! It'll never sell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Your mistake. It has sold -- foreign rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>British Prime Minister Tony Blair uses the fact that mainland Britons (and Americans) are bored and confused by Northern Ireland. Awkward formulations like ""putting arms beyond use"" -- in deference to terrorists' delicate sensibilities -- and lofty calls for peace disguise the fact that he is selling out his law-abiding countrymen for the sake of short-term expedience. The details of the latest shenanigans -- London's suspension of Belfast's assembly and its resumption 24 hours later, the equally theatrical submission and retraction of a vague IRA ""offer"" to disarm -- are unimportant, though their bureaucratic and rhetorical complexity, for both parties, is usefully obfuscating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I cling to the conviction that no U.S. president would make major decisions about American security in accordance with the wishes of people like McVeigh. It's unimaginable that Americans would tolerate a commander-in-chief who installed unrepentant terrorists in executive positions of a state government, invited convicted murderers to join and oversee a virtually dismantled state police force, and released wholesale into the community felons after risibly short sentences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oklahoma City aside, Americans have been lucky with respect to domestic terrorism. As it becomes easier technologically for small groups to cause mass casualties, that luck may not hold. If we ever are subjected to such a movement within our borders, we are likely to look to places like Northern Ireland for solutions, only to discover that the British government has prostrated itself before killers, lavishing a terrorist movement with every political gratuity it can think of -- throwing pearls before swine. Ulster sets a disturbing precedent.

Make him talk seriously about his judicial philosophy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court seat that has been vacant since the death more than a year ago of Justice Antonin Scalia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cynical conventional wisdom is that Republicans will lob softballs at the nominee, Democrats will try to portray his decisions on the federal appeals court in Denver as hostile to ""the little guy,"" and the judge himself will say as little as possible about controversial legal questions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We'd like to suggest a different approach: Senators should engage the nominee in a serious discussion of his views about the Constitution, the role of precedent and how the court should adapt general principles to changing social and scientific circumstances. And Gorsuch should respond in kind by speaking as frankly as he can, demurring only about specific cases that are likely to come before him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, Democrats are justifiably angry that the Republican majority never allowed hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland, President Obama's eminently qualified nominee to replace Scalia. One consequence of that power play is that Democratic senators are under extreme pressure from their liberal base to oppose Gorsuch. Beyond that, they have legitimate concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, from gay and transgender rights to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and reproductive rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are free to remind their Republican colleagues -- and Gorsuch -- of the injustice done to Obama and Garland.

Bush administration's policies on interrogating and detaining suspected terrorists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the main focus should be how Gorsuch would approach the role of a Supreme Court justice. Gorsuch is only 49; if confirmed, he could sit on the court for decades and outlast several presidents and Congresses. In particular, they should explore how Gorsuch would interpret the Constitution and, to a lesser extent, acts of Congress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like Scalia, Gorsuch has been described as an ""originalist,"" someone who interprets the Constitution according to the meaning its provisions had at the time they were adopted. In a speech at Case Western Reserve University Law School last year, Gorsuch said judges should strive to ""apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This formula is much less straightforward than it seems. For one thing, ""text"" and ""history"" can be at odds because language can have different connotations at different times. For example, to Americans in the 19th century, the ""equal protection of the laws"" guaranteed by the 14th Amendment might seem to protect only racial equality; in the 20th century it seemed obvious to many Americans that it also prohibited some forms of sexual discrimination. Does Gorsuch object to that updated interpretation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he believe that a constitutional provision must be viewed through the eyes of the generation in which it was adopted and can't be interpreted to deal with situations its authors couldn't have imagined, such as cellphone signals being used to track suspects without a warrant? The U.S. Constitution has never been that sort of rigid document.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scalia, for whom Gorsuch has expressed great admiration, was zealous in defending relatively specific rights mentioned in the Constitution, including freedom of speech and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures -- even in circumstances that the Constitution's framers couldn't have anticipated, such as the sale of video games or the use by police of GPS technology. But Scalia's version of originalism led to him dissent stridently from rulings recognizing rights, such as abortion or marriage equality for gays and lesbians, that his colleagues rightly read into more general language in the Constitution about ""liberty"" and ""equal protection of the laws.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those decisions were a natural outgrowth of earlier rulings in which the court secured other rights that the Constitution didn't explicitly guarantee, such as a right to marry someone of another race (or the right to marry at all) or the right to use contraceptives in the privacy of one's bedroom. An America in which those decisions had come out the other way would not be an America in which most of us would want to live.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators should ask Gorsuch whether he shares Scalia's disdain for the court's decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage and, if so, whether he would nevertheless accord those decisions respect as precedents of the court. It's entirely possible that Gorsuch would not have joined the decisions legalizing abortion or same-sex marriage but also wouldn't agitate to overturn those rulings if he joined the court. Gorsuch reportedly told Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that he didn't believe a long-established precedent should be overruled simply because five current justices think it was wrongly decided. That's a possibility the committee should look into, but as part of a broader inquiry into Gorsuch's view of the importance of precedent and predictability in the law. (Some precedents, after all, should be overturned -- witness Plessy vs. Ferguson, the 1896 ruling that approved segregation in public facilities.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if Gorsuch wouldn't upset existing precedents, he could make it harder for the court to adapt to future changes in American society if he took too constrained an ""originalist"" approach going forward. That's why it's important that senators engage him in a dialogue about his view of the court's role that goes beyond hot-button issues such as abortion, guns and gay rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gorsuch is obviously an accomplished jurist. He has been rated ""well qualified"" by the American Bar Assn. (as was Garland, who never was permitted to appear before the Judiciary Committee). Unlike some Trump appointees, he is neither a crony nor someone whose professional credentials can be questioned. But the Senate has a right to look beyond a sterling resume to inquire about the philosophy that will help shape the court for decades to come.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

But listen to us. One side pretends to believe that racial discrimination, no matter how rampant and flagrant it used to be, is now ended. Oh, maybe there's a bigot or two in the woodpile, but discrimination as a matter for governmental concern is a thing of the past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other side pretends to believe that only racists who oppose minority progress could be against <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Discrimination a thing of the past indeed! A black man in America still hasn't got a chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each side knows (but feels no urge to acknowledge) that there is at least some justice to the other's position. The blatant segregation and discrimination are largely over. Law now forbids such racism, and -- I really do believe -- public opinion won't countenance it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But racial fairness (in some instances, in some arenas) still eludes us. Corporate management and directorships, legal and accountancy partnerships, and even concern for the plight of our children clearly are not distributed on the sole basis of deservedness. Race matters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truth is complicated and inconsistent and hard to figure out. Instead of undertaking the effort to figure it out, we draw the lines as starkly as we can and force the public to choose one incomplete reality (ours, we hope) and reject the other side's partial truth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It happens not just in our race relations but throughout our politics. It even happens in our courts, as when the clever Barry Scheck deliberately cut out any middle-gray consideration in the trial of Louise Woodward, the British au pair. Force the jury to choose between the cold-blooded murder of an innocent child and innocence (or at least reasonable doubt), he thought, and surely there won't be a conviction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His now-famous miscalculation (he was in court this week trying to reinstate the grays) might serve as a lesson to us all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it might show us the wisdom of changing the terms of the debate. Much of what I'm saying, I admit, is based on my belief that most Americans want to be fair and want our important institutions to reflect that fairness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't believe there are significant, politically influential segments of the society that are happy over the fact that African American admissions at Boalt Hall, the University of California-Berkeley's law school, are down 80 percent as a direct result of Proposition 209's ban on racial preference, or that the first-year class has but a single black member. I don't believe there are large pockets of secret jubilation that a similar trend is in evidence at the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, though, I doubt that many <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> supporters -- including the beleaguered Bill Lee -- want to parcel out society's goodies on the basis of racial entitlement. Many of us may defend, but few of us are thrilled by, voting districts drawn purely on the basis of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We want (is this hopelessly naive?) the same thing: a society in which gifts and grit and character matter more than pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what are we fighting about? Mainly, I think, about how to produce such a society. Some of us believe that the best way to achieve a colorblind future is to practice colorblindness now. And some of us believe that colorblindness after centuries of racism will merely lock in white advantage -- that we need to level the playing field before insisting on a single set of rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I remember when black quarterbacks were a rarity in the National Football League -- when the most talented collegiate passers were, if they were black, switched to defensive back or running back or some such. Then a couple of coaches broke the mold -- <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>? -- and then a couple more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the six starting quarterbacks (out of 30 NFL teams) constitute parity? Wrong question. What is true is that there is, at last, reason for young black athletes to believe they can go as far, at any position, as their talent takes them. As Gene Washington, a black front office executive with the league, told a reporter:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""What's most interesting to me is that I don't notice it.

Levy is executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I was chancellor of the New York City schools, I thought that if you were smart and poor, you could write your own ticket to college. I was dead wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, where I serve as executive director, reveals that only 3 percent of students at our most selective colleges come from the 25 percent of families with the lowest incomes, while 72 percent come from the richest 25 percent of families.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The unfairness of the situation is compounded by the fact that once admitted, poor students soar academically. According to our study, the poor students who do attend these elite schools graduate at equal rates and earn similarly high grades as their wealthy peers. The Cooke Foundation awards scholarships to exceptionally high-achieving low-income students; 95 percent of Cooke Scholars graduate from these selective schools with top grades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today at selective colleges we have <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for the wealthy. More than 80 percent of the nation's top higher-education institutions give a ""legacy preference"" to children of alumni. Even the ""athletic preference"" has been warped to give the rich a better shot. Football and basketball - in which poor and minority children excel in large numbers - get the most exposure, but more student-athletes get a leg up at elite institutions in sports such as squash, sailing, crew, horseback riding, fencing and water polo. There aren't many water polo coaches in the New York City school system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The academic playing field is otherwise skewed against smart poor children. The wealthy student gets a tutor (or at least a test-prep course) and can submit his or her best scores to colleges after taking the SAT or ACT multiple times. In contrast, the child of poverty gets a single test-fee waiver and takes the test only once and ""cold."" (The College Board, to its credit, has sought to address the situation by offering Khan Academy test-prep services at no charge, which, although not the equivalent of one-on-one tutoring, is at least something.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Early-admissions programs that require a student to commit to attending a school if accepted also unfairly hold back the poor. Early admission is an easier path to acceptance, worth as much as an extra 100 SAT points, according to one report . But children of poverty can't apply early, because they can't commit to a particular school until they know how much their financial aid package will be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It goes on like this. Students from poverty are also often ill-advised by their high school counselors about college options. Public school counselors are stretched too thin - each advises, on average, hundreds of students - to give each student in-depth attention. So it is hardly surprising that only 23 percent of high-achieving low-income students even apply to a selective school, compared with more than twice as many - 48 percent - high-achieving students from families with higher incomes. As a result, many students are unaware of scholarships they are qualified to receive, and therefore don't apply to these seemingly expensive selective schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While some schools do make attempts to find high-performing low-income students, the overall impact is meager. To reduce the impact of the poverty penalty levied against the brightest low- income students, we need a serious poverty preference in admissions to elite colleges and universities - amounting to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for these students. We do not advocate reducing the role of standardized tests, because admissions officers must have a way to compare students across schools. Without reducing standardized test requirements, admissions officers need to give more credit to low-income students for having achieved at a high level despite not having the advantages of enrichment courses, internships and foreign travel. This would help to level the playing field and open the door of opportunity for academically qualified students to attend schools that match their abilities. It would also provide a backdoor way to maintain ethnic diversity in colleges, particularly if the Supreme Court does away with race-conscious <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in admissions in a case pending this term involving the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When many high-achieving low-income students apply to our nation's top institutions of higher learning, they face a far harder road than more affluent students. Rather than get credit for having successfully overcome obstacles, they face an even more arduous path. All young people in the United States should have a fair chance at academic success, based on true merit, regardless of how much money their parents have. Having wealthy parents doesn't make you smarter or more deserving of college admission. It just means you won the parent lottery.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Harold O.

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped.

It would be nice if CEO Peter Bijur would now lob a few bons mots at journalistic sanctimony, although this seems unlikely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we can still enjoy the larger point: There was a time when journalists aspired to the sensibility of novelists, to some semblance of psychological depth, rather than running around like salivating trolls playing ""gotcha."" This would have been an excellent opportunity for that earlier breed to assert themselves, given the gift of the tapes -- a fly-on-the-wall peek at real life that every journalist dreams of.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But of course the ""n"" word has become such a taboo, the mere rumor of its utterance becomes a salacious story by itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this case another hackneyed stereotype was thrown into the mix -- EVIL BUSINESSMEN -- and a whole seven-day news conflagration was built on a lie. The transcripts provided by the attorneys, of course, were abysmal. But even the transcripts make it clear that Mr. Ulrich is referring to everyone at Texaco as jelly beans, regardless of color: ""You can't have just `we' and `them.' You can't just have black jelly beans and other jelly beans. It doesn't work.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jelly beans were in the air at Texaco: On an earlier bit of tape, Mr. Lundwall is heard saying ""yum"" and offering a female colleague a jelly bean. (She declines.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even more amazing was the failure to draw on the depth of insight available from the tapes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They were secretly recorded by a participant whose motives remain a mystery: Richard Lundwall, a manager in the finance department, was subsequently let go; his tapes seem to consist of random incidents from a day in the life Texaco. We hear him straightening out the matter of a departed employee who may have swiped a laptop. We hear him waxing lyrical over the filet mignon at the Texaco cafeteria. We hear him making nondescript phone calls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But most of all, we peer into his department as it wrestles with conflicting goals that should have sent journalistic synapses firing in all directions, awakening the slumbering cognitive organ: downsizing and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the tapes make clear over and over, Texaco's finance department was being prodded from on high to reduce costs by getting rid of bodies. ""We shrink very systematically,"" one manager is heard saying. ""We absorb the job and do a lot of crosstraining."" In another instance: ""Everybody who leaves, leaves with a smile on their face"" -- referring to the effort to coax people out the door with early retirement and generous severance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We also hear survivors comparing their lot with those who left, including some who jumped to Wall Street. This prompts a discussion about the relative advantages of packing your lifetime earnings into a few stress-laden, workaholic years or spreading them out over a 30-year career of easy hours at Texaco.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But along with downsizing, the department was being pushed to upsize minority and female representation. At one point Mr. Lundwall suggests recruiting at ""Howard or Temple or [other] predominantly black schools"" where students are allowed to advance ""simply on the basis of scholastic merit."" Other MBA programs, he says, are ""under the same gun as corporations"" to promote by quota.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it bothered anybody to be firing colleagues while recruiting minorities, it doesn't show. But there is evidence of stress over race within the organization -- far more interesting and reliable evidence than an indecipherable word that some self-interested lawyer claims is ""nigger.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lundwall jokes about wearing his Viking hat during National Odin Month -- ""I'm celebrating my heritage."" Then he and Mr. Ulrich riff about the ""black"" national anthem, which evidently some Texaco employees had sung at a company event the previous year. Mr. Lundwall says, ""When they sat during `ours' -- listen to me, during `ours,' as though they're not included -- and stood for their modified one, I apologize to nobody for walking out of there.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What follows is a series of inaudible mumbles and gaps in the recording, out of which supposedly emerged the offensive comment by Mr. Ulrich. But the tone is jocular rather than angry. Elsewhere, Mr. Ulrich can be heard reviewing employment records and remarking with satisfaction on the advancement of women and minorities. And in a discussion of how to talk prospective downsizees out the door, Mr. Ulrich comes across rather well -- sensitive yet realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The press might have thrown this evidence onto the scale when weighing whether ""nunjunah"" was really ""nigger.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Calls around Texaco last week didn't find anybody willing to say, on the record or off, what sort of guy Mr. Ulrich was, even though Mr. Bijur and the rest worked side by side with him for years. Their desire to duck this question was not hard to fathom: If Mr. Ulrich were a hardened racist, they should have booted him out long ago. If he were a decent guy, defending him now would violate the first rule of post-Tylenol crisis management, which is never defend yourself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, having scored this slamdunk over various Interfaith Councils for Decrying Big Business, the company blithers that the tapes are still ""troubling."" But Texaco must live in the world, and will certainly cough up generously to settle the lawsuit and become exemplary for its ""diversity"" programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the rest of us, we might conclude that senior executives of Big Oil are honestly at sea over ""diversity"" -- as these tapes clearly reveal -- no less than anyone else is. The muckraking publication Sales & Marketing Management recently pointed out to its readers that ""African-Americans confront stereotypes that make it difficult for them to sell to [white] customers."" Who could doubt it?

''Should I get tougher on Clinton?'' he asked the crowd. ''You won't get mad at me if I get a little tougher?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By yesterday, after 24 hours of further vacillation, Mr. Dole had firmly decided that he would take off the gloves in tonight's debate (though the word ''firmly'' must always be used with caution in proximity to either Presidential candidate). Now he must confront Bill Clinton in the most inhospitable debate forum for fisticuffs -- a town-hall meeting where he'll be surrounded by 120 ''real people.'' And he must do so on a night less than three weeks before Election Day in a year when the debates thus far have failed to draw audiences anywhere near as large as those of '92.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How did Mr. Dole paint himself into this corner? Conventional wisdom blames the press for intimidating him into silence until now by threatening to shout ''Hatchet man!'' the moment he ''goes negative.'' But raising serious questions about Clinton Administration ethics, phrased precisely and respectfully, is not the same as railing about ''Democrat wars'' or crying ''Liberal!'' or invoking Paula Jones. The obvious questions Mr. Dole might ask tonight -- whether about the rifling of F.B.I. files, potential pardons for the McDougals or an influence-seeking Indonesian campaign contributor -- have been aired daily by the press itself. If Mr. Dole had articulately raised some of them weeks ago, he wouldn't so easily fit the Clinton/Gore playbook's current description of him as ''desperate.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By being so indecisive about how to act on the Clinton character issue, Mr. Dole has not only given the President a free pass, he has dramatized a big character issue of his own. Mr. Dole's habit of equivocating and reversing himself has been a damaging pattern of his candidacy from the start on a variety of fronts, not just on the matter of challenging White House ethics. He's visibly wavered so often that his leadership capabilities are as much in doubt as who hired Craig Livingstone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the primaries, Mr. Dole waffled about how to go after Pat Buchanan's extremist views much as he has waffled about challenging Mr. Clinton, refusing even to criticize Mr. Buchanan for his anti-Semitic rhetoric. When Mr. Dole's campaign officials made the embarrassing gaffe of returning a $1,000 contribution from the gay Log Cabin Republicans, the candidate dawdled for months before finally chastising his own errant staff. On abortion, he has quickly retreated under fire on nearly every stand he has taken this year, including his ''not negotiable'' call for a tolerance plank in the G.O.P. platform. Most self-destructively of all, Mr. Dole abruptly reversed his career-long stands in favor of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and against supply-side economics to prove himself, as he put it, ''another Ronald Reagan, if that's what you want.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This recent history helps explain why so many Americans don't regard Mr. Dole as a leader, but as a split-the-difference Beltway legislative mechanic. If he can't stand up to fellow Republicans, not to mention his Democratic opponent, how will he stand up to a Saddam Hussein? If he can't command his own campaign, how can he run the country? Even his own conservative allies now raise the Dole character issue -- as typified by last week's Charles Kraut hammer column faulting Mr. Dole for lacking the ''political courage'' to match his ''physical courage'' of 50 years ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Dole's character failings hardly cancel out his opponent's, but they are devastating to his hopes of presenting himself as a plausible Presidential alternative. His equivocations, reversals and avoidance of confrontations fuel the polls in which voters doubt he is tough enough to push through a 15 percent tax cut and balance the budget at the same time. Dole admirers, by contrast, point out how appealing it is to find a politician who honestly expresses his ambivalence in public rather than sticking to a phony, robotic script. That's true enough. But while Hamlets can be appealing, their chances of inheriting the White House are by definition no more likely than their ascent to the Danish throne.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

There are 36 possible pairs of justices, and in the term just concluded something interesting happened.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The top three spots were all taken by pairs of women. However you matched them up, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan voted together at least 93 percent of the time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The alignments are a product of ideology, not biology. ""They are the three most liberal justices on the court, and it makes sense that they would often be in agreement,"" said Pamela Harris, an adviser to the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown's law school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The voting pattern highlighted the rightward drift of the fourth member of the court's liberal wing, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who broke from his usual allies in a series of important privacy cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, it was often the conservative justices who voted together the most: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., say, or Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. This year, the right was more fractured. (The statistics come from Scotusblog, and the trends hold whether you look at all cases or just divided ones.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three female justices also dominated Supreme Court arguments in the last term. Justice Ginsburg asked the first question 37 percent of the time. Justice Sotomayor asked the most questions, averaging more than 21 in each hourlong argument.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Kagan, a former dean of Harvard Law School and a former United States solicitor general, by many accounts asked the best questions of any of the justices. They were crisp and conversational and probed the heart of the case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The spotlight often captured Justice Sotomayor this term, as her best-selling memoir gave rise to a book tour that drew adoring crowds. She was profiled on ""60 Minutes,"" talked with Oprah Winfrey and Jon Stewart, and visited ""Sesame Street"" and ""The View.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lawyers who appear before her say she is a source of inspiration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I think she has come into her own and is establishing herself as a formidable and independent presence,"" said Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter in Washington who has argued 33 cases before the court and served as a law clerk to Justice Ginsburg. ""Like the other two women, she's very comfortable up there, and that's a great thing for a woman like me to see.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked by e-mail for an assessment of Justice Sotomayor, a normally sober political scientist did not stint on her exclamation points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""People love her!"" wrote Lee Epstein, who teaches at the University of Southern California. ""She made a lot of money!""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Sotomayor's financial disclosure forms show that she has received more than $3 million for the book.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Ginsburg's form for last year also contained an interesting disclosure. In November, she accepted an ""award recipient gift bag"" worth $2,500 -- a swag bag, in the lingo -- when she received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their day jobs, the votes of the three justices are neither wholly predictable nor wholly united, said Lisa T. McElroy, a law professor at Drexel University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It's important to note that the agreement was not on 'women's' or 'social justice' issues,"" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The female justices were divided in two of the term's biggest cases, Professor McElroy added. Justice Sotomayor wanted to provide an answer to whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, while the other two women said the court was powerless to decide the question in the context of a challenge to California's ban on the practice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor also split on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, with Justice Ginsburg filing the lone dissent in a case that sent a challenge to the University of Texas's <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> plan back to the lower courts for a second look under a more demanding standard. (Justice Kagan, who worked on the case as solicitor general, recused herself.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at University of California, Irvine, ""they are the three most liberal justices on the court, and so it is not surprising given their ideological similarity that they vote together the most.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Breyer, the next most liberal justice, voted with conservative justices in a decision allowing the police to take DNA samples from arrestees and in dissents from rulings limiting the use of police dogs to sniff for drugs outside homes and warrantless blood testing of people stopped for drunken driving.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all three cases, he and Justice Scalia traded places, with Justice Scalia joining the three women in pressing for broad Fourth Amendment protections.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I ought to be the pinup of the criminal defense bar,"" Justice Scalia told an audience at the University of Wyoming in October. He had been hunting in Wyoming, with Justice Kagan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia described their trip in an interview in February with Nina Totenberg at George Washington University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It was, unfortunately, not successful,"" he said. ""We got antelope tags, which are expensive for out of state, and mule deer tags. Didn't get a single shot at an antelope or a mule deer. So she ended up killing a white-tailed doe, which she could have done in my driveway.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""She dropped that doe with one shot,"" he said of Justice Kagan's exercise of her Second Amendment rights. ""Boom. Just like that.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia is also close to Justice Ginsburg, but there are limits to their friendship. ""I can't imagine Ruth hunting,"" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From Left, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan.

6478e9af7d038af16d294843	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1023015447.xml.txt	"<div><p>Main Street: Chief Justice Roberts Taxes Credibility</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not once in the 59 pages that constitute Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts's lead opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius does he use the word ""integrity."" Even so, in the days since the individual mandate was upheld as a tax, concern for the ""integrity"" or ""legitimacy"" or ""reputation"" of the Roberts Court has become the most accepted explanation for why the chief justice ruled as he did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus Reuters, which tells us that Justice Roberts was ""trying to preserve the integrity of the judiciary in polarized Washington."" Or the New York Times, where Tom Friedman lauds the chief justice for ""a simple noble leadership impulse at a critical juncture in our history -- to preserve the legitimacy of the Supreme Court."" The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer agrees with this motivation, speculating that had Justice Roberts ""been just an associate justice, and not the chief"" he might well have voted otherwise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Krauthammer is correct, it raises a disquieting question. During Justice Roberts's confirmation hearings back in 2005, he described judges as umpires whose job it is to call balls and strikes as he sees them. The idea that he might have voted otherwise if he were not chief justice suggests that a ""strike"" was changed to a ""ball"" because of concerns for how the straight call would be perceived.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let us stipulate that there's nothing wrong with a justice who starts out with one opinion but changes his mind as he reviews the facts and arguments. Let us agree too that the reputation of the court is a legitimate concern of any justice. The fundamental difficulty remains: a labored lead opinion that looks like a conclusion struggling for a rationale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unless Justice Roberts tells us, we will never know for sure. Still, the circumstantial evidence is persuasive. For one thing, against the contrivance of the lead opinion there is the clarity of a united dissent that we now understand started out as a majority view with Justice Roberts's support. That clarity likewise characterizes two separate decisions by conservative federal appellate judges -- Laurence Silberman and Jeffrey Sutton -- who upheld the individual mandate as a penalty under the Commerce Clause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also hard not to notice that people now extolling Justice Roberts for rescuing the court's integrity are largely the same ones who have been impugning it. That's especially true of the White House, which had made plain that if the Supreme Court had gone the other way on health care, the Roberts Court would become a major target of Obama's re-election campaign. The chief justice knows how ugly that might be, having sat through the president's crass political attack on his court during the 2010 State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As more than one conservative has pointed out, the integrity of liberal justices who reliably line up for whatever outcome is desired by the Democratic Party goes unquestioned. Indeed, the definition of integrity assumes one direction. For example, the one notable occasion when the Supreme Court specifically invoked integrity was back in 1992 (Planned Parenthood v. Casey), when the court used it to justify reaffirming Roe v. Wade's conclusion -- a constitutional right to abortion -- while rejecting the reasoning that led to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, in that case the court was deferring to a previous judicial power grab and not to the people acting through their elected representatives. Still, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's clarifying rebuke is well worth reprising here: ""Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perception -- a job not for lawyers but for political campaign managers -- the Justices should do what is legally right.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia's dissent in Casey illuminates a political handicap imposed on conservatives by their own principles. Whereas the liberal belief in a living Constitution allows them to stretch its limits to justify almost any desired outcome, conservatives believe the Constitution imposes real limits. The chief justice's tax argument rankles because no one else in America is buying it: certainly not the conservative dissenters, who firmly reject it, nor the court liberals, who appear to have winked because it gave them the outcome they wanted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The day after the ruling came down, this newspaper carried an article that explained Justice Roberts's decision this way: ""By confounding charges that the court is too partisan, the chief justice might have earned sufficient political capital to move to the right during the next term, when the court will likely confront a host of hot-button issues, including <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage and the continued vitality of the Voting Rights Act.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If earning ""sufficient political capital"" is simply a consequence of his ruling, Justice Roberts cannot be blamed. If it was the aim, however, and it led to his voting as chief justice in a way he would not have voted as an associate justice, he has raised rather than resolved questions about the integrity of the Roberts court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

A few students -- we won't pretend to know how many -- have been plotting a swell trick to lampoon the sometimes wretched excesses of political correctness on campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As far as that goes, who can complain? American academia wears no single ideological facepaint. But in the aggregate, the thinking of the professoriate (and often the earnest studentoriate, too) can self-censor dangerous thoughts. These thoughts include any suggestion that individuals or groups deserve to be critiqued let alone -- heaven forfend! -- criticized. So unless the group in question holds authority, or wealth, or is otherwise by definition oppressive, even honest critiques or criticisms tend to be unwelcome. Judgment can be, you know, so judgmental.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if your worldview is more impish than that, how best to make fun of the people, the cultural values, that others hold so sacrosanct?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One whispered proposal at Columbia is an ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale,"" at which white or Asian students would be charged markedly more for pastries than Latino or African-American or Native- American customers. The point is to confront the college community with the purported silliness of discriminating -- favorably and unfavorably -- on the basis of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not irreverent enough for you? How about a rollicking game of ""Catch an Illegal Immigrant""? Players compete for a bounty by trying to corral a student who dresses up as, say, a Guatemalan border- runner. (Extra yuks if the ""illegal"" pours water down his back, thus rendering it wet. What a hoot!)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Don't think ill of Columbia. Peruse news databases and you'll find similar antics at elite universities by the dozen. Columbia's students are distinguished by restraint: They'd be late to this party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ours being a free country, there's nothing illegal about insulting groups of people in ways that some individuals in those groups might find hurtful. But noted wit Don Imus has done all of us a courtesy by letting us see the pain that a moment of hilarity can cause others. The young women from Rutgers University had the perfect response to Imus' game. They wouldn't play.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ignoring obnoxiousness is such a marvelous retort that it's remarkable how rarely most of us do that. The typical campus reaction to bake sales and immigrant games is to form committees, and draft policies, and pronounce prohibitions -- exercises in correctness that, yes, only betray an overweening fealty to correctness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So if spring frolics bring a clever bake sale or border game to a campus near you, let it be. And try to imagine how Don Imus felt when he realized how his momentary fun had wounded some college kids who aren't as fortunate as he.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports	
6478e9af7d038af16d294843	test_question_against_testing_1	<p>TESTING THE WATERS DROPPING THE SAT WOULD MEAN FAILING STUDENTS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Got a weight problem? Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>		stance:::None/Not Discussed

And they never seem to end.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Paris protesters are getting all the attention, but France isn't the only country where angry masses are taking to the streets to be heard.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Journal reported Monday that an estimated 55,000 people gathered in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur last weekend to defend race-based policies that give preferential treatment to the majority Muslim Malay population. Defenders argue that ending racial preferences would ""dilute decades of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies introduced to help Malays catch up with the generally wealthier ethnic Chinese,"" who comprise less than a quarter of the population.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> in Malaysia began in the 1950s, after the British colonial administrators, who had welcomed laborers from China, departed. Since 1971, Malays have enjoyed preferential treatment over their Chinese compatriots in everything from schooling and housing to government jobs and access to capital. The government's express goal was ""racial balance,"" and to that end Malay entrepreneurs were given preference in obtaining credit, licenses and government contracts. Developers offer Malays discounts on new homes, and shopping centers have even banned ethnic-Chinese-owned businesses to limit competition with Malay proprietors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These policies were supposed to sunset in 1991, but the country's leaders have repeatedly extended them in exchange for political support. ""Schemes favouring Malays were once deemed essential to improve the lot of Malaysia's least wealthy racial group,"" explains the Economist magazine, but ""these days they are widely thought to help mostly the well-off within that group, while failing the poor and aggravating ethnic tensions.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To anyone who has followed the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> debate in the U.S., a lot of this probably sounds familiar. Like their Malay counterparts, American proponents of racial double standards say they are necessary to help the underprivileged, even though the beneficiaries tend to be people who were already well-off to begin with. Liberal politicians defend color-conscious policies to win votes, and courts assure us the policies will not exist in perpetuity. ""We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,"" wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in a 2003 Supreme Court decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it has in Malaysia, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> continues to stoke racial and ethnic tensions in the U.S., especially in education. Harvard is being sued for discrimination against Asian applicants. The plaintiffs say Asians are held to higher standards than other applicants to limit their numbers on campus. Harvard insists that more Asians aren't admitted because they aren't as multidimensional as their non-Asian peers, an argument eerily similar to the one Ivy League schools once used to discriminate against Jews.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has angered the parents of white and Asian students by pushing for racial quotas at the city's top public high schools. Some 80% of black and Hispanic students in New York City's traditional public schools perform below grade level in reading and math. Is it really any wonder that black and Hispanic students are underrepresented at elite schools that use an admission test? Unfortunately, the mayor and his supporters would rather scrap the test than focus on doing a better job of preparing kids to take it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the debate domestically often centers on the legality of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and whether it's permitted under our constitution, a more practical concern is whether these policies actually work as intended--here in America or in other countries where they've been implemented. Malaysia's racial preferences have been in place for more than 50 years, and the Malays still haven't caught up to the ethnic Chinese, who outperform them in school and in the workforce. The gap has narrowed over the past half-century, but it remains significant, and attributing Malay progress to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is dubious. For one thing, Malays in neighboring Singapore, which has no <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and where they are a minority, are better off economically than the Malays in Malaysia, who receive favorable treatment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs in the U.S. are regularly given undeserved credit for expanding the size of the black middle class. The reality is that the most dramatic declines in black poverty preceded <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs, which began in earnest in the 1970s. Black incomes doubled in the 1960s--before <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. And blacks were entering middle-class professions at a much faster clip in the decades preceding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than they did in the decades following its implementation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the University of California system ended race-based admissions in 1996, more blacks enrolled and a higher percentage of them not only graduated but obtained degrees in the more challenging fields of engineering and science. Policies intended to help sometimes do the opposite, whether they are implemented in the U.S. or halfway around the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Jason L.

Keep that in mind as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems like an easy case. How could a federal statute designed to end the historic suppression of African American voting not be constitutional? The 15th Amendment gives voters of all races equal rights and expressly grants Congress the power to enforce those rights -- which Congress exercised by reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act (VRA) for 25 years in 2006.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The vote was 98 to 0 in the Senate and 390 to 33 in the House; a conservative Republican president from Texas, George W. Bush, signed the legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If judicial restraint means anything, surely it counsels Supreme Court affirmation of the VRA -- against the pending challenge by Shelby County, Ala., which says it has basically ended voter discrimination so Congress has no right to subject it, or other mostly Southern jurisdictions, to Justice Department ""pre-clearance"" of its election rules, as prescribed in Section 5 of the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Judge David Tatel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit wrote for the majority of a three-judge panel last year,""in this context, we owe much deference to the considered judgment of the People's elected representatives.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's the problem: Although hugely successful at securing the franchise for individual black voters, the Voting Rights Act has had corrosive unintended consequences, including, ironically, greater political polarization along racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As construed by courts, modified by Congress and enforced by the Justice Department, the act all but requires covered jurisdictions to maximize the concentration of African American and other minority voters in legislative districts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In theory, this enables minorities to elect candidates ""of their choice."" In practice, it divides many states into a small number of majority-black districts, which usually pick liberal African American Democrats, and a larger number of overwhelmingly white districts, which choose conservative white Republicans. Moderates get squeezed out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Voting Rights Act is one reason House debates so often pit upstart tea party Republicans from Southern suburbs against veteran African American Democrats from Southern cities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Civil rights organizations defend the legislation's current incarnation as if the risks to minority enfranchisement were unchanged since 1965. This is understandable. Much as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in universities helped build a middle class after segregation, ""opportunity districts"" for minority candidates helped create a cadre of black elected officials. The act's pre-clearance showed continuing relevance as a check on potentially discriminatory voter ID laws in Texas and South Carolina.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the law too often produces anomalies such as the 2003 case Georgia v. Ashcroft, in which civil rights organizations sided with a Republican Justice Department against a state redistricting plan on the grounds that it did not create enough majority-minority districts -- even though Georgia's African America Democratic officeholders overwhelmingly supported the plan because they wanted to spread black votes, and influence, more widely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the most part, minority voters no longer face the kind of blunt denial of voting rights that gave rise to the 1965 act; in 2012, blacks voted at a higher rate than whites, according to a Pew Research center analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In such a world, the corrosive political effects of racial gerrymandering under the VRA loom larger -- even compared with the benefits to minority candidates. The creation of safe minority districts put a floor under the number of blacks elected but also, arguably, a ceiling over how high they can rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the South, the message and ideology that win in a majority-minority district rarely work at the (majority-white) statewide level.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress didn't really tackle such issues when it extended the Voting Rights Act in 2006. Small wonder: Incumbents of both parties and all races owe their positions to the current system. A shake-up of the status quo might have exposed them, and then-President Bush, to election-year charges of racial insensitivity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fact is, by 2006 the Supreme Court had expressed concerns about the real-world consequences of the Voting Rights Act in several cases,and it has again since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It should surprise no one if the Roberts Court invokes precedent requiring that federal impositions on the states be ""congruent and proportional"" to the civil rights violations they remedy, and it strikes down, or guts, pre-clearance -- holding that rules based on mid-1960s political realities are simply out of sync with the 21st century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would be a pretty activist ruling. But it might just start a healthy debate about how we can protect voting rights while restoring the nation's political center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>lanec@washpost.com</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

It’s time to pop the bubble.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you have spent any time around conservative politics, you will have heard the inevitable grousing about liberal media bias and how much harder this makes it for Republicans to win elections. Journalists, of course, question whether this is true — though this position grows steadily less defensible, particularly when considering coverage of social issues, in which acclaim of the left-wing position is near-universal among the ""mainstream.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lately, though, I've begun doubting whether Republicans and those who agree with them are right — wondering whether media defenders shouldn't just say: Hell yes, Republicans, the media has a left-wing bias, but don't worry, that hurts Democrats more than you.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My most recent occasion for these musings was a column that Ezra Klein of the New York Times wrote about David Shor, a progressive election analyst. Shor thinks the left has a major problem with its youthful and well-educated activist base, which staffs left-leaning newsrooms and runs campaigns. They focus, naturally, on issues that excite them, and Shor told Klein ""the things that are most exciting to activists and journalists are politically toxic.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change, for example, is something that very liberal White people ""care way more about"" than anyone else, according to Shor, so when you focus on it, ""you sound like a weird, very liberal white person."" Even immigration and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have proved surprisingly unpopular with the very voters of color they were supposed to woo.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shor has his detractors, of course. Their objections might be summed up by progressive strategist Anat Shenker-Osorio's response to Klein: ""The job of a good message isn't to say what's popular but to make popular what needs to be said."" Democrats of her persuasion might prefer the framing advocated by law professor Ian Haney Lopez: ""The idea is to shift the basic political conflict in the United States from one between racial groups (the right's preferred frame) to one between the 0.1% and the rest of us, with racism as their principal weapon.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To me, Shor's vision — sort your ideas by popularity, then ""Start at the top, and work your way down to find something that excites people"" — sounds less inspiring but more likely to help Democrats get and hold power. It doesn't require Democrats to persuade voters that, say, an Asian American assistant professor has exactly the same interests as a rural, White call-center worker or a Hispanic plumber and that only a conspiracy of the very rich prevents them from realizing it. Democrats merely have to learn what voters already want.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But while Shor's more prosaic strategy might be an easier sell to voters, it is apt to be a harder sell to the young idealists who staff campaigns and newsrooms. And the newsrooms might be a bigger problem than the political class.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Matt Yglesias pointed out on Twitter, ""A closed circle of young, college educated staffers is likely to end up further off-center the more they talk to themselves."" The mainstream media, and staffers' internal fights spilling onto Twitter, are an important part of how the progressive vanguard talks to itself — and as the media skews ever-leftward, it helps sustain a rarefied bubble where divisive slogans such as ""defund the police"" can be questioned only with great delicacy, while significantly more popular propositions like ""use the military to help police quell riots"" cannot be defended at all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This inevitably affects campaign coverage, and in ways that arguably make it harder for Democrats to pivot away from divisive identity politics. Shor can insist all he wants that Hillary Clinton's campaign ought to have focused on her higher-polling economic message, but as his critics note, the media paid far more attention to Trump's problems with immigrants, women and racial minorities, leaving Clinton limited scope to set a different agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media can probably afford to live in that bubble, even if it means that the public identifies commentators and other journalists as extensions of left-wing political campaigns, rather than neutral arbiters. (Many Republicans already see the media that way, and independents may be starting to.) Outlets depend less and less on advertisers that shun controversy and more on a select group of highly educated, politically engaged subscribers who generally prefer Democrats to Republicans, and may well prefer the linguistic politics of the educated class — ""Latinx"" instead of ""Hispanic,"" or ""birthing people"" instead of ""women"" — and policies such as defunding the police over putting more cops on the street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats cannot afford to cater only to that hyper-educated class — not in a country where only a third of the population has a bachelor's degree. But if Shor is right, moving to where the voters are will require the highly engaged staffers and donors to sacrifice their own interests and commitments to political expedience. Naturally, they will look for reasons they don't have to. The danger is that a media that shares their commitments will provide those reasons, right up to the point where the left has talked itself into an electoral disaster too big for anyone to deny.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

The only question was, Why?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia, a self-described ''far right'' law professor at the University of Texas, was attending the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala at what could only be called a triumphal moment. The Federalist Society, a group of conservative lawyers and academics, has emerged from obscurity to become perhaps the most powerful force in the law today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over four days of panels and soirees, the Federalists were the toast of official Washington. Members of the Bush cabinet, including Attorney General John Ashcroft, joined in the festivities. And Justice Antonin Scalia mused to a packed banquet hall, ''Who would have thought 20 years ago that that little organization of students at a couple of law schools would have evolved today to a power of such proportions?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the legal panels, administration officials fell over themselves to say what the crowd wanted to hear. At a business-law panel, a top Justice Department lawyer talked about settling the Microsoft antitrust case, a move applauded by conservatives, who saw the suit as Clinton-era interference with the prerogatives of big business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But to Mr. Graglia, the administration's business-friendly line sounded like so much liberal claptrap. During the question period, he demanded to know why the administration was bothering to enforce antitrust laws at all. ''It really is time to be bold,'' he insisted. ''The boldest thing to do would be to repeal all the laws.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia wasn't the only conservative who was suffering. A woman stood up to declare herself ''dissatisfied and frustrated'' because the panel had not attacked the states for suing tobacco companies. A law professor fulminated against state attorneys general, like Eliot Spitzer of New York, who, by crusading to clean up the Enrons and WorldComs of the world, have become self-appointed securities commissioners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I must admit that when I headed down to Washington last week, I was expecting to encounter a good deal of gloating. The last time I spent any time with the Federalist Society crowd was on the Harvard Law Review, where a claque of right-leaning law students used to hang out late into the evening, grumbling about <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and the New Deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now this same crowd is setting the nation's legal policy and selecting its judges -- with a freer hand than ever since the Republicans retook the Senate. They are using their informal network to place conservative true believers in influential positions throughout the federal government, from Supreme Court clerkships to top agency posts. In fact, one of the late-night Harvard Law Review grumblers from way back when, Miguel Estrada, is now a Federalist Society favorite for the next vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the Federalists' remarkable good fortune, I had expected the banter to be heavy with congratulations and plans for the future. But much of the rumbling in the hallways was of grudges' being lovingly nursed and of potshots' being fired against liberal enemies long ago vanquished.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before one event, a graybeard in the audience tutored a wet-behind-the-ears Federalist on the horrors of Travelgate, in which the Clinton White House did -- well, nothing much, really. At the black-tie banquet, a satirical song took aim at ''Brennan, Marx and Lenin.'' William Brennan, the Supreme Court justice who was being gleefully branded a communist, died in 1997.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The search for fictive liberal enemies reached a loopy low on the convention's last day, when an archconservative federal appeals court judge, Laurence Silberman, accused William Rehnquist's archconservative Supreme Court of having a secret plan to declare the death penalty unconstitutional. In an opinion just last month, the court reiterated its view that capital punishment is constitutional even for 16-year-olds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the event that most captured the spirit of the week was Kenneth Starr's speech and his introduction by Barbara Comstock, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Public Affairs. Between them, Ms. Comstock and Mr. Starr managed to rail against Bill Clinton, James Carville, Lanny Davis, James Jeffords, Alan Dershowitz, the Warren court, trial lawyers and Barbra Streisand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Starr was particularly exercised about liberals' being result-oriented, abandoning their principles to reach the outcomes they favor. But he would have made a more compelling case if he had not proceeded to abandon his -- and the Federalist Society's -- own oft-repeated commitment to judicial restraint to praise the Supreme Court for striking down the Gun-Free School Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act in a burst of conservative activism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was the take-away, as meeting planners like to say, from the Federalist Society's big convention? First, if these are the folks choosing federal judges for the Bush administration -- and they are -- Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans need to be vigilant about investigating nominees' backgrounds, and using the filibuster, to prevent a far-right takeover of the courts. Second, Democrats and moderate Republicans in both houses will need to stand up for mainstream principles that are now under assault, like antitrust law and health and safety regulations. And finally, a point of sportsmanship: the only thing less appealing than a sore loser is a sore winner.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

With a title like that, need I bother to mention that the author is a conservative?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As such, he focuses on the cliches that trouble him most, and they happen to be those that he has heard uttered by liberals. That's sort of like reading Playboy for the articles; it's interesting, but something important is missing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do agree that some cliches like ""violence never settles anything"" need to go, at least until we find a good substitute for the word ""never."" In fact, history offers many examples of violence settling things, although not always in ways that were expected by its initiators. Vietnam, Iraq and the secession of the Confederacy come immediately to mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the more of Goldberg's book I read, the more appreciation I feel for the pithy power of the bumper-sticker truisms he ridicules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I like, for example, the old chestnut, ""Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer."" Goldberg responds, ""So you won't mind if those 10 guilty men move next door to you?"" Sure, but why blame the innocent guy for the 10 guilty guys next door? I would blame our criminal justice system for its failure to do what taxpayers pay them to do: Protect not only our lives and property but also our constitutional rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This barroom argument would not annoy me as much if there were not 289 exonerations of convicted individuals thanks to DNA evidence since 1989, according to the Innocence Project. The DNA era confirms some of our worst fears: We're getting the worst of both worlds; innocents are suffering while the guilty go free. And Goldberg gets to joke about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The author doesn't like ""Diversity is strength,"" either. (""Cool,"" he writes. ""The NBA should have a quota for midgets and one-legged point guards!"") Yet without getting into the deep weeds of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> debates, this country has prospered as a result of its mulligan stew of ethnics -- its Pages and Goldbergs, etc., etc. -- and our ability, more often than not, to work together with a sense of common purpose despite our differences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And surely Goldberg is not serious in his potshots at this old gem: ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Sure, he writes, ""if the other man is an idiot."" But, so what? An idiot can kill you just as dead as a sane man can. And even the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was viewed as a terrorist by those whose segregated way of life he set out to upset.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I would argue that one person's cliche is another person's wisdom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To illustrate and offer a bit of balance to what Goldberg has initiated, here are a few of the most annoying cliches, in my view, that I often hear from the political right:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""We don't solve problems by throwing money at them."" Sure. But you don't solve many problems by sucking money out of them either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Poor people need to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps."" Easier said than done, my friend. I tried to pull myself up by my own bootstraps and almost tumbled over on my head.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Keep the government's hands off of my Medicare."" Not easy. You'll have better luck with your bootstraps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Liberals love free speech as long as it supports the left."" Unlike conservatives, who love free speech as long as it does not come from the Quran or the Dixie Chicks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""America: Love It Or Leave It."" Funny, but I haven't heard that one much since President Barack Obama's election. Can we bring it back?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Why are all the news media slanted to the left -- except Fox News?"" Maybe Stephen Colbert got it right. He said, ""Reality has a liberal bias.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was a joke. It's not a cliche, yet.

6478e9af7d038af16d294843	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421118533.xml.txt	"<div><p>PERSPECTIVE ON MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.; A Visionary With More Than a Dream; Today's fuzzy icon had many practical ideas for improving the lot of blacks, some now taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The four words, ""I have a dream,"" seared into the nation's consciousness by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. almost 34 years ago, have been both a blessing and a curse. To many, they are a beacon still calling to the country. To others, they have indelibly tagged King as a hopeless utopian with lofty visions of ending war, racism and poverty, but with no concrete program to achieve these aims. No wonder the man we celebrate today has practically been turned into a harmless, badly outdated icon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he isn't. In a work largely ignored when it was published 30 years ago and all but unknown today, ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?,"" King turned from dreamer to problem solver. But before we look at those ideas, there are two huge caveats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, recasting the words of a historic figure to fit present situations must be avoided. This type of dangerous ideological revisionism was shamefully evident in the contentious debate over Proposition 209 in California. Both sides exploited and deliberately distorted the few stray remarks that King uttered on what is known today as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, a concept just beginning to take shape in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second caveat is that King can't be fitted into a neat ideological box. There is enough paradox and ambivalence in King's positions for liberals and conservatives to praise and damn. At various times, he railed against and embraced black militants. He applauded violent anti-colonial and national liberation movements and championed nonviolent change. Paradox and ambivalence also marked his private life. As a man of God, his moral lashing of America was wildly at odds with his questionable sexual conduct. Not surprisingly, King's solutions to many of the big-ticket racial and class problems that plagued America were a mix of idealism and pragmatism, which people faulted for lacking a clear direction. King can't be blamed for that. Three decades after his death, America is still no closer to solving these problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* The black family crisis. King branded the black family ""fragile, deprived and often psychopathic."" While he could have been criticized for giving weight to negative myths and stereotypes about black families, King was correct in targeting father absenteeism in the black home as a major ill. He made the standard liberal call for more government-funded job, education and skills training programs. But he also recognized the importance of values like training, discipline, hard work and the reduction of family violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Educational neglect. King did not believe that more funds, smaller classrooms and better textbooks alone would solve the crisis of the classroom. He called on teachers and administrators to rededicate themselves to the ideal of quality education, and for parents to get more involved in their children's education. King's proposal for ""educational parks,"" a kind of multifaceted complex for teaching basic skills as well as advanced studies, anticipated the idea of magnet schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Political apathy. Exercising the right to vote and electing blacks were not enough for King. He challenged black officeholders to be ""independent and assertive"" in fighting for legislation to improve the plight of the black poor and for black organizations to build political alliances with labor and other ethnic groups based on the needs and interests they have in common.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Corporate racism. The campaign against discrimination in hiring and promotions that followed the Texaco scandal closely followed a four-step plan outlined by King. It included more jobs and promotions, selected buying campaigns, boycotts and organized protests, negotiations and the monitoring of any agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Economic empowerment. King often quipped that it was futile to integrate a lunch counter if blacks couldn't afford to buy a meal. He demanded huge increases in federal funding for job and skills training programs. But he also recognized that government couldn't or shouldn't be expected to do it all. He called for ""black dollar days"" in which blacks purchased goods and services from black businesses and deposited their savings in black-owned banks. In turn, King expected black entrepreneurs to recycle those dollars into education, recreation and social programs for the black poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Crime and violence. King understood that the destructive cycle of drugs, crime and violence destabilized black communities. While his first priority was, as always, more government-funded job and education programs, he also stressed family values, personal responsibility and discipline. He urged black professionals to give more of their time and money to employment, educational and recreational programs aimed at ""saving"" at-risk black youth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Welfare. King agreed that reliance on welfare could breed dependency and discourage personal initiative. He proposed that the government provide direct tax subsidies and tax incentives to corporations to hire and train unskilled workers. This idea was a forerunner of today's federally backed enterprise and empowerment zones.

Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 will be on the ballot, giving voters the chance to repeal Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education in 1996, nearly a quarter of a century ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hail ACA 5 as a way to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic and gender inequalities, while opponents decry it as a form of categorical discrimination that privileges race and gender over merit. One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This view is wrong — the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard’s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard’s tenured professors are white — 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the “Chinese virus” and most recently “kung flu.” Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It’s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never “leveled the playing field,” but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

Rehnquist has cancer is how much information the court owes the public about the chief justice's health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only facts revealed -- that Rehnquist has one of several forms of thyroid cancer and that he received a tracheotomy at Bethesda Naval Hospital before being discharged Friday -- were enough to fuel speculation by medical experts about the 80-year- old's condition but not to settle the most pressing questions about the future of the chief justice, and of the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court's terseness is consistent with its long tradition of discretion concerning justices' personal lives. With few exceptions - - in 1975, after a crippling stroke, Justice William O. Douglas held a news conference -- health information about the life-tenured members of the court is especially closely guarded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tradition was born in the days before the court played a central role in policymaking. But now, when the court has a role in everything from whether race can be considered in college admissions to the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, some are saying that tradition has to change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If the chief justice's medical prognosis is indeed such that he may not be able to finish this term, that's something the American people have a right to know, especially where you have dueling doctors speculating about the meaning of a tracheotomy,"" said David J. Garrow, a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at Emory University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If it were [Speaker of the House] Dennis Hastert or [Senate Minority Leader] Tom Daschle, people would say there is an unchallengeable public right to know as much as the public official himself knows,"" Garrow said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others defended the court's approach. They noted the constitutional differences between the judiciary and the other branches of government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The court operates according to a different rule,"" said Michael A. Carvin, a former Reagan administration Justice Department official. ""There is no constitutional transition issue like you have with the president. There is no day-to-day, commander-in-chief-type responsibility. You can operate the court on autopilot. You can't operate the presidency that way.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also is possible that not even the chief justice is certain about his condition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""In my opinion, he owes the public whatever he gives the public,"" said Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper, a former Rehnquist law clerk. ""He may still be finding things out himself.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SWINGER: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role on the court, long a matter of conventional wisdom among lawyers, has been confirmed by the latest quantitative methods of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a forthcoming North Carolina Law Review article, professors Andrew D. Martin, Kevin Quinn and Lee Epstein show not only that O'Connor is the court's ""median voter,"" but also that the 74-year- old has moved steadily to the left in recent years, taking the court with her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of math is involved, but basically the professors ranked justices on a numerical scale, assigning point values to their ideological leanings as shown through their votes. The higher the number, the more conservative the voting record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2002, the last term covered by the study, Justice Clarence Thomas was the most conservative, with a score of 3.637; Justice John Paul Stevens, at -2.516, was the most liberal. O'Connor's score, 0.247, just a hair to the right of center, represented the court's midpoint. O'Connor's score has gone down steadily, or become more liberal, since 1994. In that year, she was at 0.637.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study also argues that, but for O'Connor's evolution, the court would not have approved of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, which it did in 2003, by a 5 to 4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to their calculations, the political scientists say, ""the likelihood of O'Connor providing the key vote to uphold the program was quite small for any term prior to 2001.""</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

Bill Clinton is not a racist. We can posit that. But he did play subtle racial politics in the primary. It's way past time for him to accept the fact that there's a new wunderkind in town.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as Bill Clinton looks at Obama and sees his own oblivion, so does Jesse Jackson. As Shelby Steele wrote in The Wall Street Journal, Jackson and his generation of civil rights leaders ""made keeping whites 'on the hook' the most sacred article of the post-'60s black identity,"" equality pursued by manipulating white guilt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now John McCain is pea-green with envy. That's the only explanation for why a man who prides himself on honor, a man who vowed not to take the low road in the campaign, having been mugged by W. and Rove in South Carolina in 2000, is engaging in a festival of juvenilia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Arizona senator who built his reputation on being a brave proponent of big solutions is running a schoolyard campaign about tire gauges and Paris Hilton, childishly accusing his opponent of being too serious, too popular and not patriotic enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even his own mother, the magical 96-year-old Roberta McCain, let slip that she thought the Paris Hilton-Britney Spears ad was ""kinda stupid.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain's 2000 strategist, John Weaver, was equally blunt with Newsweek's Jonathan Alter: ""It's hard to imagine America responding to 'small ball' when we have all these problems.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of McCain's old pals in the Senate are cringing at what they see as his soulless transformation into what he once scorned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""John's eaten up with envy,"" said one. ""His image of himself was always the handsome, celebrity flyboy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Now somebody else is the celebrity,"" the colleague continued, while John looks in the mirror and sees his face marred by skin cancer and looks at the TV and sees his dashing self-image replaced by visions of William Frawley, with Letterman jokes about his membership in the ham radio club and adventures with wagon trains.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For McCain, being cool meant being a rogue, not a policy wonk; but Obama manages to be a cool College Bowl type, which must irk McCain, who liked to play up his bad-boy cool. Now the guy in the back of the class is shooting spitballs at the class pet and is coming off as more juvenile than daring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Around the McCain campaign, they grouse that Obama ""hasn't bled."" He hasn't bled literally, in military service, just like W., the last holder of an E-ZPass who sped past McCain. And he hasn't paid his dues in the Senate, since he basically just stopped by for directions to the Oval Office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a new senator, Obama was not only precocious enough to pounce on turf that McCain had invested years in, such as campaign finance lobbying, ethics reform and earmarks. When Obama did reach across the aisle for a mentor, it was to the staid Richard Lugar of Indiana, not to the salty Republican of choice for Democrats, McCain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the Illinois freshman took back a private promise to join McCain's campaign finance reform effort, McCain told his aide Mark Salter to ""brush him back."" Salter sent an over-the-top vituperative letter to Obama. ""I guess I beaned him instead,"" Salter told Newsweek's Howard Fineman.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain could dismiss W. as a lightweight, but he knows Obama's smart. Obama wrote his own books, while McCain's were written by Salter.

Maybe that's why, in this race of all-but-certain presidential nominees, I find myself distracted by Alan Keyes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or rather by the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes. I'm not suggesting that Keyes is likely to repeat in New Hampshire his startling showing in the Iowa caucuses--a third-place finish with 14 percent of the vote--much less that he'll still be battling George W. Bush for the Republican nomination as the party convention draws nearer. The subplot I've been following treats a much simpler question: Are white voters truly capable of looking beyond a black candidate's race?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans seem certain that the answer is ""no,"" while white voters--on much the same evidence--believe it has long since been answered in the affirmative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Didn't we help elect David Dinkins mayor of New York City and Doug Wilder governor of Virginia? whites will say. And blacks will reply: Yes, but in substantial measure out of racial guilt--which means that it was, at bottom, a race-tinged vote. Similarly with elected officials from Massachusetts's Ed Brooke to Oklahoma's J. C. Watts, and with that most-popular of noncandidates, Colin Powell. I remember remarking, with utter seriousness, that the white-led bandwagon for Powell was a way for white people to prove to themselves they had gotten over their fixation on race. Now Alan Keyes has me wondering if I've gotten over mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A televised interview with a handful of Iowans after the Keyes surprise makes my point. The reporter was talking to these white conservatives--members of what we call the ""religious right""--and a couple of them were explaining how they compared Keyes and Gary Bauer and found Keyes's views more to their liking. One of the respondents mentioned that she'd like to see Keyes on the ticket of the eventual nominee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What struck me about that brief exchange was that it seemed genuinely to have nothing to do with race, only issues. And I was reminded by something in my long-repressed memory:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Strom Thurmond, as Old South and conservative as they come, standing up at those 1991 Judiciary Committee hearings for Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. I don't imagine Thurmond was motivated by racial angst. Indeed, the Senate's 1,000-year-old man seemed indifferent to the fact that Thomas's white wife, Virginia, was a daily fixture at those hearings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He may have supported Thomas for reasons I would reject, but on this issue, at least, Strom Thurmond seemed, like that woman in Iowa, to have surmounted race in favor of political philosophy. I have to think it's a good thing--and too little recognized by those of us who insist we want to be judged by characteristics other than the color of our skins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But look how these conservatives get beyond race--by supporting African Americans whose views are anathema to the rank and file of black voters. Doesn't that demonstrate their disregard for what black people in general think? Doesn't it suggest that the only way they can forget our race is by supporting black folk who have forgotten it too?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what would we expect?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That these dyed-in-the-wool conservatives--who oppose a woman's right to choose abortion, who think <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is Satan's own tool and who never saw a new government initiative they didn't hate-- should get out the vote for Jesse Jackson Sr.?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't mean to suggest that all conservatives have retired their suspicions of racial minorities, or that racism and a certain brand of conservatism have been disentangled. I'm suggesting only that those of us who refuse to believe that white people can be conservative without being against black people may have some disentangling of our own to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And a modest bit of celebration. For if conservatives--the people we have always viewed as our dedicated enemies--are willing to move beyond our race to consider our character and our philosophy, why there may be hope for white liberals, too.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

All but two Democrats voted ""nay.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rejection of a Supreme Court nominee is unusual but not unheard of (see Clement Haynsworth Jr.). But rarely has a failed nominee had the pedigree -- and intellectual firepower -- of Bork. He had been a law professor at Yale, the solicitor general of the United States and, at the time Ronald Reagan tapped him for the court, a federal appeals court judge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, Bork was a legal intellectual, a proponent of original intent and judicial restraint. The task of the judge, he once wrote, is ""to discern how the framers' values, defined in the context of the world they knew, apply to the world we know."" He said that Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion, was a ""wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation"" of authority that belonged to the states, that the court's recent rulings on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> were problematic and that the First Amendment didn't apply to pornography.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whatever you think of these views, they cannot be fairly characterized as extreme; Ruth Bader Ginsburg, among many others, has questioned the rationale offered by the court to justify Roe v. Wade. Nor was Bork himself an extremist. He was a strongly opinionated, somewhat pugnacious, deeply conservative judge. (At 84 today, he hasn't mellowed much either, to judge from an interview he recently gave Newsweek.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I bring up Bork not only because Sunday is a convenient anniversary. His nomination battle is also a reminder that our poisoned politics is not just about Republicans behaving badly, as many Democrats and their liberal allies have convinced themselves. Democrats can be -- and have been -- every bit as obstructionist, mean-spirited and unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'll take it one step further. The Bork fight, in some ways, was the beginning of the end of civil discourse in politics. For years afterward, conservatives seethed at the ""systematic demonization"" of Bork, recalls Clint Bolick, a longtime conservative legal activist. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution coined the angry verb ""to bork,"" which meant to destroy a nominee by whatever means necessary. When Republicans borked the Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright less than two years later, there wasn't a trace of remorse, not after what the Democrats had done to Bork. The anger between Democrats and Republicans, the unwillingness to work together, the profound mistrust -- the line from Bork to today's ugly politics is a straight one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is, to be sure, completely understandable that the Democrats wanted to keep Bork off the court. Lewis Powell, the great moderate, was stepping down, which would be leaving the court evenly divided between conservatives and liberals. There was tremendous fear that if Bork were confirmed, he would swing the court to the conservatives and important liberal victories would be overturned -- starting with Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But liberals couldn't just come out and say that. ""If this were carried out as an internal Senate debate,"" Ann Lewis, the Democratic activist, would later acknowledge, ""we would have deep and thoughtful discussions about the Constitution, and then we would lose."" So, instead, the Democrats sought to portray Bork as ""a right-wing loony,"" to use a phrase in a memo written by the Advocacy Institute, a liberal lobby group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The character assassination began the day Bork was nominated, when Ted Kennedy gave a fiery speech describing ""Robert Bork's America"" as a place ""in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters,"" and so on. It continued until the day the nomination was voted down; one ad, for instance, claimed, absurdly, that Bork wanted to give ""women workers the choice between sterilization and their job.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives were stunned by the relentlessness -- and the essential unfairness -- of the attacks. But the truth is that many of the liberals fighting the nomination also knew they were unfair. That same Advocacy Institute memo noted that, ""Like it or not, Bork falls (perhaps barely) at the borderline of respectability."" It didn't matter. He had to be portrayed ""as an extreme ideological activist."" The ends were used to justify some truly despicable means.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, of course, the court has a conservative majority, and liberal victories are, indeed, being overturned. Interestingly, Bolick says Bork's beliefs would have made him a restraining force. Theodore Olson, who served as solicitor general under George W. Bush, also pointed out that after Bork, nominees would scarcely acknowledge that they had rich and nuanced judicial philosophies for fear of giving ammunition to the other side. Those philosophies would be unveiled only after they were on the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mostly, though, the point remains this: The next time a liberal asks why Republicans are so intransigent, you might suggest that the answer lies in the mirror.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

And I insist on being Dr. Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Titles in the academy are inconsistent at best. I have colleagues who would prefer to be called by their first name, or nicknames like “Bone Saw.” But they are mostly men, and almost all white, and they have that luxury.

But they don’t understand my story, and that of many other women and people of color in the academy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having worked with thousands of students, I know for a fact that for many — though by no means all, or even most — there is already a presumption that I, as a female and African-American, am less qualified than my white male colleagues, or at the very least that I was hired in order to meet a double minority quota. And I get it — anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> ideologues have managed to not only demolish the legitimacy of that policy, but tar the reputation of anyone who might have benefited from it (even if, like me, they did not).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do I know? Sometimes it’s just a sense, a feeling I get from people’s tone of voice. But some students will automatically call me Ms., while naturally referring to my male counterparts as Doctor or Professor. I’m not alone: When I meet fellow female engineering professors at conferences, this sort of treatment is always a topic of conversation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In class, I have my derivations questioned, lectures critiqued, grading regarded as too harsh or unfair and my expectations dismissed as too high or difficult. I once had a student who would review notes with me that he had taken on my lecture, then offer tips on how I could improve. It seems he thought he was doing me a favor, despite the fact that I had been teaching for six years by then. I doubt that this is an experience that many of my male colleagues have ever had to endure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On other occasions, I have had students state that it is difficult to follow my lectures because of my dialect or slang (neither of which I have, or use).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what can I do? I already have to run faster and jump higher just to gain that minimal level of respect that my colleagues are graciously, automatically afforded. But I can also insist that my students interact with me in a professional manner, even if it’s not something they’re accustomed to in other classes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I tell friends outside the academy about these challenges, they’re often surprised. It’s 2014, and this is higher education, where enlightened worldviews are supposed to dominate. But consider that according to data from the American Society for Engineering Education, as of 2011 African-American women made up 4 percent of all women in the engineering professoriate. Between 2001 and 2012, the number of African-American engineering faculty members increased to 3 percent from 2 percent. In all, in 2012 there were only 140 African-American women working as engineering professors — out of some 24,640 across the entire field (not including computer engineering).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For me, this statistical desert is made even more stark by the fact that, at a private school in a Midwestern town like mine, students may have interacted with African-Americans only in the service industry, or in high school, with female teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I decided to become an engineering professor 20 years ago while sitting in class and realizing that I had never had a professor who looked like me, acted like me or even seemed interested in me. I was typically one of only two or three female students, and one of only one or two African-American students. I wanted to change the face of engineering by showing that the profession could be cool, interesting, exciting, engaging and, most important, diverse. In that way, insisting that students use my title isn’t just about me — it’s about broadcasting, to any female and black students who might hear it, that I am black, a woman, and an engineer, and that they can be the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I enter my classroom today, I am still one of only two or three women in my department (depending on how you count the faculty), and I am one of only one or two African-Americans. Still, I hope that someday, when an African-American woman walks into an engineering classroom, the students recognize that the professor has arrived, and that she won’t have to insist on their calling her Doctor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

This has sparked much Monday- morning quarterbacking among industry groups and industry-funded folks as to what went wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This issue should have been a 'gimme' for the administration,"" former Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow Jonathan Adler e-mailed CEI President Fred Smith last week, insisting the merits of the issue favored the White House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Despite this . . . the administration got hammered and will continue to get hammered,"" Adler said, by enviros and ""pundits who know less about environmental law than [Environmental Protection Agency chief Christine Todd] Whitman (and that's saying something).""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem? ""Poor communication,"" writes Adler. That plus ""the utter intellectual vacuity and laziness of environmental journalists,"" he said. ""If the arsenic issue cannot be 'won,' it will be hard to win anything that matters.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus the quick turnaround on the pro-salmonella proposal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adler's e-mail notes people should have stressed that there were ""no industry beneficiaries"" in voiding the Clinton move and that there was still a federal arsenic regulation in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enviros such as Elliott Negin of the Natural Resources Defense Council, however, insists the problem was that the facts didn't back the Bush team. Negin said, for example, the Environmental Arsenic Council, a trade group of chemical, oil and mining companies, staunchly opposed the new standard already adopted by the Europeans - - and the old federal standard was adopted in 1942, before it was known that arsenic was a carcinogen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Adler may be right about this. People cringe at the word ""arsenic."" Industry must level the playing field and rename arsenic. Perhaps ""Rosewater?"" Or ""Passion Mist?"" Maybe ""Old Lace?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What happened to those guys who came up with ""fecal matter?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And now, the first of a likely endless string of fundraisers and political to-dos at the Clinton home in Northwest.

We want an equal shot regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or disability, and in this nation of laws that should be assured. But like the speed limit, such laws mean nothing unless they are strictly enforced, so a proposal by the Clinton administration to boost civil rights enforcement could make a real difference. Employers, contractors, mortgage lenders and landlords would make more decisions in a truly impartial manner if failure to do so had surer and quicker consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That racial barriers persist is unquestionable. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissent against a 1995 decision concerning <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, was eloquent in describing them: ""Racial inequality . . . and discrimination's lingering effects . . . are evident in our workplaces, markets and neighborhoods. Job applicants with identical resumes, qualifications, and interview styles still experience different receptions, depending on their race. White and African American consumers still encounter different deals. People of color looking for housing still face discriminatory treatment by landlords, real estate agents and mortgage lenders.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House plan, if approved by Congress, would increase civil rights funding 17%, from $516 million to $602 million. Some Republicans may object to any increase in government. The political opposition is harder to figure. How can opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, who say they only want equal opportunity, reject tougher enforcement of existing laws enforcing equality?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A current barrier to enforcement is the overworked, underbudgeted and understaffed federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Clinton proposal would increase funding by $37 million to reduce the backlog of 64,000 cases and encourage more use of mediation, which is a quicker and less costly method of resolving disputes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's civil rights division, overseer of laws governing employment, housing, education and public accommodations, would get an 11% funding increase. To discourage housing bias, the White House would increase Housing and Urban Development Department funding by $22 million, among other things making possible the hiring of more ""testers""--applicants identical on paper but of different racial backgrounds. Their visits to landlords and real estate agents often uncover wide disparities and are the best possible measure of compliance with fair housing laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Clinton seeks to engage the nation in a debate on the divisive issue of race. Dialogue is important, but actions speak louder. Strict and timely enforcement of civil rights laws will give more people the fair shot that each of us deserves.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

5add6b6aeb60400001536f2c	test_question_pro_testing_1	"<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

Democrats occupy the governor's office, both U.S. Senate seats and five of seven statewide partisan offices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of two statewide elected Republicans--Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush--has suffered a potential career-ending scandal. Scratch him as a future governor. The other--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Secretary of State Bill Jones--angered major GOP campaign contributors by defecting to Sen. John McCain after having committed to Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Jones is now on the political disabled list.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is one healthy player, and he's not exactly a bench warmer. He's the new state Senate minority leader, Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte, 44, is the most politically savvy, articulate Republican in the Legislature. Indeed, it's tough to think of a Republican throughout California who commands more respect among politicians of either party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""He makes things happen in the Capitol,"" notes GOP consultant Ray McNally. ""And he does it without surrendering his conservative principles. Without selling out.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte's first political job was slapping on bumper strips for gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan as a 10-year-old. Eventually, he became an advance man for Vice President George Bush, worked for several politicians and was elected to the Assembly in 1990.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Quickly rising to Republican leader, Brulte orchestrated the GOP's ""takeover"" of the Assembly in 1994. But three Republicans sold out to Democrat Willie Brown and Brulte was denied the speakership. In 1996, he moved to the Senate, became GOP caucus chairman and, when Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine stepped down as minority leader for family health reasons last week, Brulte succeeded him without a fight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's now his responsibility to improve the GOP's 25-15 disadvantage in the Senate--or at least keep the scarce seats the party holds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What drives Brulte is political conquest and legislative compromise, not any ideological cause. He brings to the arena congeniality. ""I don't provoke people,"" notes the 6-foot, 4-inch, 260- pound GOP leader.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That means less legislative gridlock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's not one to hang up a budget over, say, abortion funding. In truth, no recent GOP leader has, partly due to Brulte's coaxing. He's basically antiabortion but tries to avoid the divisive issue. Same with gun control; he mostly votes against it, but cautions Republicans that they are on the wrong side of history on firearms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked how his party got to this low point, Brulte replies: ""It allowed itself to be painted as intolerant. It picked issues that tended to divide rather than to unite. And we're now [in the Senate] trying to focus on issues that unite.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Issues like school accountability, lower college fees, transportation planning. He won't get into the errant, divisive issues--abortion, illegal immigration, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte has his own <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program: He pumped $400,000 from his political kitty into the winning primary campaigns of Republican women and minorities. ""I wanted to send a signal that at the highest level of the party, we're prepared to put our money where our mouth is,"" he says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An optimist, Brulte professes not to worry about the GOP's future in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Conventional wisdom is historically wrong,"" he says. ""Three years ago, Gray Davis was pretty much derided. Today he's governor. . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Perception always trails reality. And the Republican Party was in trouble long before people recognized it. We're still in trouble, but we're better off than people think.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The party is financially better off since Brulte became its finance chairman last fall. It was $300,000 in debt; now it has more than $1 million in the bank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Considered Bush's point man in California, Brulte recruited the candidate for a $2-million-plus party fund-raising dinner. This week, Bush is in California again raising another $2 million for the state and national parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Says Gov. Davis' chief strategist, Garry South: ""I think the world of Brulte. We're honest with each other. He's never sleazed me. I pick his brain. He picks mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""My only concern about Brulte is he's had such a meteoric rise, he's going to think the next step is running for governor.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not likely. But given their bench, Republicans could do worse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Message No: ..ACCN: 00042160</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: GRAPHIC-DRAWING: SACRAMENTO</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

The experiences he recounted were ""a source of amazement and inspiration,"" she wrote, not only for what they revealed about him ""but also because of what they instill in, and ask, of us."" She said she found herself ""hoping to hear, just once more, another story that would, by and by, perhaps change the way I see the world.""I was touched by the essay when I first read it, but also puzzled. If I had been asked to name justices who were immune to Thurgood Marshall's influence, Justice O'Connor, who had been on the court for 11 years and had served with him for 10 years, would have been on the list. She opposed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and her states'-rights orientation made her antagonistic to federal court review of state criminal justice issues. I was taken aback by her first line in a 1991 majority opinion that rejected an appeal from an inmate on Virginia's death row. ""This is a case about federalism,"" she declared. Justice Marshall dissented.And yet. By the time of her own retirement in 2006, Justice O'Connor was in a very different place. She wrote the majority opinion that preserved <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in university admissions. She modulated her views on federalism. It would be ridiculous to ascribe Justice O'Connor's migration in late middle age solely to the influence of Justice Marshall, who died in 1993. But it would be equally ridiculous to discount his influence entirely. Why not take her at her word? She must have sensed something in 1992, a pull in a different direction.Could President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, assuming her confirmation, inspire any of her new colleagues to see the world in a different way?There doesn't seem to be a Sandra Day O'Connor lurking within today's carefully constructed conservative supermajority, and the heroic trajectory of Thurgood Marshall's life is not Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's story. It's fair to say that she has more in common with the justice she has been named to replace. Like Stephen Breyer, she was a star student at an excellent public high school. Her father, like his, worked as a lawyer for a big-city school board (Miami in her case, San Francisco in his). Success at Harvard Law School propelled them both to a Supreme Court clerkship (in fact, she clerked for him). Justice Breyer is often referred to as the father of the federal sentencing guidelines and served on the original United States Sentencing Commission, where she later served as vice chair.In drawing these parallels, I have deliberately not emphasized race. Yes, her nomination fulfills the president's campaign promise to appoint a Black woman, the first to sit on the Supreme Court. While that's cause for celebration, it shouldn't obscure the other kinds of diversity she would bring to the court.Diversity has many dimensions, perspective among them. That she would be the first former public defender to sit on the court has received wide notice, less so the fact that as a public school graduate she would be a rarity among the justices. Justice Breyer's departure will leave only two, Elena Kagan, who attended the highly selective Hunter College High School in Manhattan, hardly a typical public school, and Samuel Alito, who went to Steinert High School in Hamilton Township, N.J., near Trenton, his hometown. Every other member of the court is a graduate of a Catholic high school, a striking but little-observed fact at a time when cases concerning public and religious schools and the relationship between the two are prominent on the court's docket.Justice Breyer's wife, Joanna, is a clinical psychologist who during her active career specialized in working with children being treated for cancer at the Lahey Clinic in Boston. Does having a medical professional in the family account for Justice Breyer's emphasis on facts and evidence in his opinions on medical subjects? With medical questions hardly about to disappear from the court's docket, it's worth noting that Judge Jackson's husband, Patrick, is a surgeon. (Justice Sonia Sotomayor's brother, Juan, is a doctor with an allergy practice in upstate New York.) Some conservative justices seem to assume that doctors don't act in the interest of their patients, whether performing abortions or administering vaccines. Maybe Judge Jackson will be able to persuade them otherwise.Or maybe not, but my point is that we cheat ourselves out of a full appreciation of what a person brings to the court if race is our only focus. On the day of Judge Jackson's nomination, Curt Levey, president of the right-wing interest group Committee for Justice, put out a statement that was as preposterous as it was predictable. ""Jackson should be asked about her views on race,"" the statement said, adding that ""at a time when a major <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> case is on the Supreme Court's docket and our nation is debating whether equality or equity should be the governing anti-discrimination standard, we hope that senators will ask Judge Jackson about her views on equity, racial preferences, disparate impact and the like.""Maybe it's only white nominees who are not expected to answer questions about pending cases. Maybe I missed other news releases from the Committee for Justice, but I don't remember Mr. Levey asking senators to drill down on the views on racial issues held by President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court nominees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Don't white Supreme Court nominees also have a race?Thurgood Marshall, born into segregation in 1908, was already a Supreme Court justice when Ketanji Brown was born 62 years later. She will walk through the doors that he opened. But her life story is not without power. She thrived at an integrated high school -- most public schools in the United States remain racially segregated -- where she was class president and a star debater, despite the lowered expectations that white administrators had for her.Her parents attended historically Black colleges, building a solid middle-class life for their children's future. Her teenage dream was to be a judge. By 2012, when the country had a president determined to diversify the federal courts, Judge Jackson had walked through every open door and was ready for Barack Obama.It's a quintessentially American success story. Thinking about what her role on the court might be, is it fanciful to suppose that some of her colleagues, age mates who checked the same boxes on their way to the top, might look at Ketanji Brown Jackson and see themselves? Perhaps in the very familiarity of her path to the Supreme Court -- a story that to others might look extraordinary -- might lie its ability to inspire, or at least to prompt conservatives who are sure of what they think to think again. No, I don't expect her to change the court. But she may well change the conversation, and that's a start.The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

Al ""The Mushroom"" Grzyb picked up his own phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a small miracle because the call lasted only 20 seconds. But that was long enough for him to explain that he didn't know anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't know anything about the Duffs and Waste Management and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And he didn't have any opinion on how the tough pink guys got $100 million in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> contracts through Mayor Richard Daley's administration. That's odd, since he was Daley's purchasing agent for 11 years, and he was the political firing pin on just about every political deal benefiting Daley's cronies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Just so you know, if there's anything you have, I haven't read anything about it,"" Grzyb said nervously.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I knew it! That's big news right there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb is obviously a loyal Sun-Times reader. They buried the Duff story Tuesday. Perhaps they didn't have a new logo they could use to claim it as their own--say a photo of the Duffs drinking with Daley at their legendary Como Inn Christmas parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And TV isn't interested in the Duff story much, either. The news broke Monday afternoon as federal prosecutors released court documents outlining their case against the Duffs. A TV reporter who has said publicly that he's not afraid of angering Daley explained why TV isn't interested. He'd like to do the Duff story, really, but there are no ""visuals.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he meant is that there are no cars in it, or trucks, things that go ""vrrooom"" with lights flashing and so on in the file tape. That's TV news for you. There's not much video excitement in a contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I thought that $100 million to white guys with Outfit connections who allegedly pretend to be minorities--and convinced their buddy Rich Daley of it too--is an interesting story, especially with the Duff federal fraud trial weeks away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I'm not with the city anymore,"" Grzyb said, as if we didn't know, since we called him at Elzie Higginbottom's business office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom's company, East Lake Management, ran that building at 69 W. Washington St., where six people died after being trapped in a stairwell with locked doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom is a Daley guy, and Grzyb needed a soft place to land after he got too hot for City Hall. It's nice to know that Higginbottom's office can protect at least one person from heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb, whose name means ""mushroom"" in Polish, was asked about the Duff-Waste Management-Blue Bag deal that the U.S. attorney's office outlined in federal court filings this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my reading of the documents, here's how it played out: A City Hall underling figured out that the Duffs were not minorities, then had the audacity to deny their minority certification on the Blue Bag contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sensing a grave injustice by being denied an opportunity to become minorities, one of the Duffs discussed this blatant discrimination with a top trucking boss and a Waste Management official and a ""City Official A.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon, Troy Ratliff, a deputy of Grzyb's, overruled the underlings. Grzyb approved the Duff contract for workers to sort out recyclable garbage for Waste Management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I don't really have any opinions on it,"" Grzyb said. ""I don't work for the city anymore. If you have any questions, call the city's press office.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb has been at the center of other deals for Daley. And he was never brought before the Chicago City Council for confirmation, because he didn't have the proper credentials under the State Purchasing Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he had the one credential that counts. He knew how to say yes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grzyb? Who was the Waste Management official you met with on the Duff deal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I don't really have any comment,"" Grzyb said. ""That's it. Thank you.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mushroom then hung up the phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He wasn't the only non-chatty type Tuesday. The mayor says he hates corruption. But he had nothing to say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""First of all, I'm not going to comment on it, it's a pending [federal] case,"" the mayor told me, a bit peeved, which is his usual expression when I come within 1,200 yards of him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I know nothing about it, I tell you,"" Daley insisted. ""I know nothing about it, any other questions?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've been critical of the Duff-Daley deal, but now it might be time to reconsider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We Americans tell our children they can grow up to be anything, from cowboys to astronauts. So why can't the white guy Duffs aspire to minority status, even if it's only on paper, and even if they are white men?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What kind of a country do we live in, anyway? Is this the land of opportunity, or is it not?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least at Chicago's City Hall, miracles do happen, sometimes. And a very large miracle brought the Duffs $100 million of your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

But Obama is a Democrat, beloved by the glassy-eyed media as a symbol of hope and change, even if guys from Chicago's City Hall run his administration. So the gaffe will  soon wash over him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it's that other screw-up that is most illuminating -- the one that was overshadowed by his unfortunate Special Olympics wisecrack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama told Jay Leno he was surprised that those greedy AIG executives who helped lead the country into financial ruin were in line to receive $165 million in bonuses paid for by bailout cash authorized by his administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Stunned, stunned is the word,"" said Obama.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that his Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- who didn't pay all of his federal taxes but was still deemed worthy by Obama of collecting yours -- knew all about the AIG bonuses weeks ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was long before Washington Democrats began shrieking in pretend outrage over the bonuses, as if they didn't vote for them, sort of like Chicago aldermen shrieking about corruption from the 5th Floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's like Mayor Richard Daley saying, ""Gee, I dunno"" when news breaks that his nephews are in another multimillion-dollar government deal. Or that time that Daley gave $100 million in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> contracts to men he knows well, yet was stunned to learn later that they were white guys, not black females.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These days, the Washington Way is looking just like the Chicago Way. Those of us from Illinois can see it, what with City Hall guys pulling White House strings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then again, we're not surprised because we don't get the high-grade Hopium out here in the Midwest. The good stuff must be reserved for the Beltway media establishment, since they're the ones feeling  tingles running up their legs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet even they'll figure out that the Chicago Way runs along Pennsylvania Avenue, once the Hopium wears off and the tingling stops. It'll probably take about eight years for their heads to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the meantime, all last week, the ludicrous Angry-Democrat-vs.-Greedy-AIG slapstick was highly entertaining, except when you realize the premise of the joke is that American taxpayers are so stupid we'll believe anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she'd tax those arrogant AIG guys and take the money back. This is the same Pelosi who is extremely wealthy, worth millions,  yet she jets coast to coast on weekends on your dime, because she's the speaker. Why doesn't she buy her own jet and have the unemployed AIG guys serve drinks to the real estate lobbyists?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At her news conference Thursday, Pelosi became so upset over AIG questions that she cut off reporters by saying, ""New subject, or else,"" and naturally, being under the influence of primo Hopium, they changed the subject.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But all this false congressional outrage and shrieking and fingerpointing should be understood for what it really is: Political buttocks-covering by Democrats who are worried about the 2010 elections, and afraid of losing their greatest symbolic weapon: The Evil Rich Guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's another cartoon, like Mr. Burns on ""The Simpsons,"" who steps on the backs of the humble working man. Now, though, the Democrats aren't fighting Mr. Burns, they're giving him a boost so he can step on our necks with a pair of snazzy AIG loafers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What they're trying to drown out with all their screaming is that the Democrats knew all about the $165 million to the AIG suits. And the Obama White House knew all about it too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, it was a rather brave New York Democrat, Rep. Joseph Crowley, who asked Geithner about the AIG bonuses in a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee. Not yesterday, or a couple days ago, but on March 3.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Just last month,"" Crowley told Geithner, ""AIG paid 343 employees of AIG FP -- their Financial Products division that created the financial hole that AIG is in, and in turn a multibillion-dollar bill for American taxpayers -- $56 million in bonuses and are slated to pay an additional $162 million in bonuses to 393 participants in the coming weeks,"" Crowley said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""And there's more,"" Crowley said. ""Further bonus payments totaling approximately $230 million are due to 407 participants at AIG's Financial Products division in March 2010. This makes no sense to my constituency.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it makes perfect sense back here, where we get only that  weak schwag Hopium. They cut the deal in some back room, and Geithner is being measured as the fall guy. It sounds just like Chicago's City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm stunned, really.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned is the word.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: Photo: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who testified on Capitol Hill this month, knew all about the millions in bonuses for American International Group Inc. executives weeks ago.

As executive director of the Rev. Pat Robertson's very big, influential and conservative Christian Coalition, Reed has vigorously opposed mainstream civil rights leaders on such key issues as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and welfare reform.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, the idea of Beijing hosting the notoriously Red-baiting Nixon sounded laughable, too, until it happened. At least Reed has a shorter leap to make than Nixon did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reed has long called on white, Christian conservatives to make amends for centuries they spent on the wrong side of black liberation. In his 1994 book, ""Politically Incorrect: The Emerging Faith Factor in American Politics,"" he wrote that historical cooperation with slavery and segregation ""undermined the moral authority of religious conservatives as they have sought to redress other forms of social injustice--abortion, euthanasia, religious bigotry--in recent times.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To plug the gap, the coalition has announced Samaritan Project, a multiracial program to rejuvenate low-income, inner-city neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Headed by an African-American, the Rev. Earl Jackson, the coalition's national liaison for community development, the Samaritan Project offers compassionate conservatives a chance to put their money where their mouths are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among other ideas, it proposes a new multiracial partnership to revitalize local churches and rejuvenate the national debate on racial justice. It commits the coalition's members and its network of 125,000 churches to raise funds for partnerships with 1,000 inner-city churches by 2000, particularly for those churches which are helping at-risk youths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On racial justice, the coalition plans a May conference in Baltimore to which black and white church leaders from across the nation are invited to hammer out an agenda for cooperation ""across racial and cultural lines.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a conference call with me and six other newspaper columnists last week, Reed and Jackson said the project was inspired by the organization's successful call for white churches to help rebuild black churches destroyed in last year's wave of church burnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Reed and Jackson said, they have raised $850,000 and given away most of it in grants averaging $20,000 per church to 40 congregations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""African-American leaders were far more receptive than I ever thought possible,"" Reed said. ""I never asked people whether they were Democratic or Republican or liberal or conservative. It has changed us. God took a tragedy and turned it into something good.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The help could hardly go to a better place. The black church has been the African-American community's most durable and liberating institution through times much tougher than these. Black church leaders were the core of the abolitionist movement, the civil rights movement and countless independent, self-help neighborhood housing and social service programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, their successes usually wind up on the back pages of local newspapers, if at all, making a very small blip on the media's or the public's radar screens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Christian Coalition can bring the communications network that can help black churches feel less isolated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It can also bring about public attention that can help change society's prevailing cynicism about the ability of poor people to help themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Publicity does have its virtues. Assignment editors who yawn at the efforts of a little church here or there suddenly perk up when Ralph Reed holds a press conference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the less noble side, there is no question that conservatives hope the Samaritan Project will improve not only their moral authority but also their political clout. In return, the coalition hopes it can win black support for an array of ideas liberal leaders tend to oppose: school vouchers, a tax credit (not just a deduction) for charitable donations, tax breaks to encourage business investments in depressed areas and vouchers for schools and drug rehabilitation programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each of these ideas is currently being proposed in various forms in the House by Oklahoma's J.C. Watts, Congress' only black Republican, and in the Senate by Republican Daniel Coats of Indiana.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So be it. Black church leaders will have to decide for themselves whether the Samaritan Project is manna from Heaven or a Trojan horse. In the meantime, I am delighted, after years of racially polarized national politics, to see conservatives compete with liberals for black support. It's also refreshing to see churches take the lead again for racial reconciliation. We can use a few miracles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustrtion by David Csicsko.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

A coalition of civil rights groups made the settlement possible by agreeing to pay 70 percent of the $433,500 judgment that Sharon Taxman won in a lower court for back pay and lawyers' fees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> thought that the Supreme Court, which was scheduled to hear the case in January, was likely to find the race-based layoff decision improper. They also feared the Court would have gone further and prohibited consideration of racial criteria in employment in general, thus jeopardizing voluntary <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> plans in all workplaces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Avoiding a Supreme Court ruling, in this situation, was a smart move. The Piscataway case was a difficult one with unusual facts. The teachers, hired the same day, had equal seniority and comparable qualifications. The school district, forced to trim staff for budget reasons, chose to keep the black teacher because she was the only black teacher in her department. The district's goal of maintaining racial diversity was honorable, but its approach was clumsy. The Clinton Administration, which first supported the action, reversed itself this summer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At some point, the Supreme Court will address whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits considering race in any employment decision, except as a remedy for actual discrimination.

64488a23553ba5078eb6cb9e	test_question_pro_testing_2	"<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

It may seem counterintuitive to suggest that the Caucus should support the passage of legislation that targets the rich for a tax reduction. But a meaningful capital gains tax cut will help those of us in the black community who are helping to create jobs for middle- and working-class people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Passage of a capital gains tax cut will stimulate economic growth by freeing up capital for new investments, including venture capital investments in black-controlled companies, thereby creating jobs for the constituents of CBC members. In the long run, policies that increase the availability of investment capital for entrepreneurial endeavors could completely eliminate the need for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Venture capital, which would receive a big boost from a capital gains tax cut, is a proven method of creating jobs. The most recent study by Venture One Corporation and the National Venture Capital Association found that 495 venture-capital-backed companies generated 75,240 new U.S. jobs between 1989 and 1993. It also found $2 billion of export sales were generated by the same companies. The CBC needs to become a more active and vocal advocate of the black business community in general and the flow of investment capital to black business in particular. As welfare reform increases the pressure on disadvantaged blacks in the inner cities of America, policies that stimulate black business growth are needed to provide opportunities for those coming off the welfare rolls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the moment, the private equity business, with more than $170 billion under management as of year-end 1994 (according to Private Equity Analyst estimates), flourishes with capital contributions from public pensions funds, corporate pension plans, banks and insurance companies. But very little of that capital has been directed to black firms. It is a national problem that deserves national attention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond simply cutting capital gains taxes, there are other measures the government can take to help black-owned busineses. Two initiatives come to mind, both of which can be initiated by the administration without additional legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, since the Labor Department regulates pension funds and has the responsibility to issue interpretations of regulations, Secretary Robert Reich could issue interpretations of current pension fund policies to encourage them to invest in black-owned businesses. The second initiative should be aimed at getting the brokerage industry to raise money for the black companies. With approximately $1 trillion raised each year by the U.S. brokerage industry for American businesses, it would be good business for the major brokerage firms to tap the capital markets on behalf of black businesses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But none of this is a substitute for a capital gains tax cut. The effect on black-controlled businesses would be to greatly increase the flow of venture capital in the form of equity to such businesses. This decade has seen for the first time genuine interest being expressed by the institutional investment community in making venture capital investments in black businesses. Substantially all black-controlled companies are privately held, and are precisely the type of firms that would benefit from an increased infusion of venture capital from institutions and wealthy individuals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A good indication of the impact that such investments can have on black employment lies in a 1993 Wall Street Journal survey, which found that 60% of all black businesses employ a work force at least 70% black. With a badly needed infusion of equity capital to allow them to expand, black firms would create more jobs for the substantially black constituency base of CBC members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are other benefits for the CBC in a capital gains tax cut. It would enable the lawmakers to replace the narrowly targeted broadcast properties tax incentive recently struck down by the Republican majority in Congress with a tax incentive that would benefit all industries in which black businesses operate. It would also enable the CBC to form a unique alliance with the Republican Congress to enact legislation that will help all Americans, including black Americans. Such an alliance would position the CBC as a dynamic voting bloc and its members as leaders able to deliver for their constituents by skillfully adapting to the changing political environment. This would most certainly increase the value of the CBC vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Granger is president of Ark Capital Management in Chicago.

RIGHT AT THE POLLS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Internet has made it easier than ever to find information, buy books, communicate with people all over the world, and goof off at work. Now it promises to simplify a dreary task that looms before us this year: choosing a president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No, it does not provide the sort of ""help"" offered by glad- handing office-seekers who are eager to enumerate their heroic virtues and inspiring achievements--and to mournfully recite the many ways in which every single one of their opponents falls short. Between now and November, we will have plenty of middle-age men in blue suits doing their utmost to talk us into making a decision congenial to their interests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you would prefer to make a decision congenial to your interests, you can consult a couple of Web sites that serve the function for politics that the personal ads serve for romance: matching compatible partners. They give you questionnaires asking your views on various national issues, tabulate your answers, and tell you with whom you are most likely to find long-term happiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of these is selectsmart.com, where the range of choices goes from Pat Buchanan to Ralph Nader, though it also includes all the sane people in the race. Candidates you have probably never heard of before, such as David McReynolds and Howard Phillips, are there, and the site provides sufficient candidate information to explain why you have never heard of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The questionnaire asks about abortion, crime, defense, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, education, taxes, foreign policy, and the like. I filled it out and was presented with a list of how my views compared with those of the candidates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the top of my list was Harry Browne, a Libertarian Party candidate who scored 89 on a scale of 100. No argument there: I voted for Browne in 1996, and I may do so again, more to express my general outlook on policy than because I really want his finger on the nuclear button. Tied for second were Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch (61), followed by George W. Bush and Steve Forbes, both at 53.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Equally interesting was finding out who would be most likely to cause me to emigrate to Canada should he ever get to the Oval Office. Moving down the list, I learned that I should vote for Donald Trump over Bill Bradley, and that my views would be better represented in the White House by David McReynolds, a Socialist, than by Al Gore. Only Warren Beatty, it seems, is further from my thinking than the vice president. Somehow, this last revelation did not come as a surprise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over at presidentmatch.com, the options are limited to candidates of the two major parties, and after I answered the quiz, I was informed that Alan Keyes and I were made for each other. Next was Steve Forbes, followed by George Bush. Coming in last, the blind date from hell, was none other than Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The main disagreement between the two sites was over the other candidates: selectsmart ranked John McCain better for me than Bill Bradley, while presidentmatch said I should run screaming from McCain, unless the only other option is the guy who invented the Internet. So if the contest comes down to Bradley and McCain, I'll have to flip a coin. Or shoot myself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is all useful information, but it falls short of making the choice as easy as filling out the options you want on a new car, and it could be misleading for anyone who takes it too seriously. The matchmakers pay little attention to some important issues, like the federal budget, missile defense, letting China into the World Trade Organization, and the use of metal bats in baseball (Bush, bless him, would allow wood only).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matters like experience in office get little weight, which makes Forbes and Browne look better than they really are. Temperament and political skills, in which Bush and Bradley might contrast favorably with Gary Bauer or Orrin Hatch, are not considered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason Alan Keyes and I are classified as compatible is that neither President Match nor Select Smart gave me the chance to express my reluctance to vote for someone who appears to be out of his mind. Select Smart put Pat Buchanan in the middle of the pack for me, even though I would sooner pinch Mike Tyson on the bottom than vote for a raving anti-Semite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's something to be said for forcing yourself to contemplate which policies you favor--and for finding out whether the candidate you are drawn to for one reason or another is actually one who would head in the direction you want to go. By focusing on issues of substance, the quizzes are a good antidote to McCain's biography, Bradley's NBA career, Bush's rakish grin, and Gore's . . . well, Gore is probably his own antidote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So if you want to make an intelligent choice in this election, you could do worse than to answer one of these questionnaires. And if you end up voting for Harry Browne, don't blame me.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

And his lectures to me were on how blacks must be active in both political parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in 2000, the reasons some blacks join the Republican Party are more complicated. Thirty years ago, my father, along with other civil rights activists such as then-Assistant Secretary of Labor Art Fletcher, were building a legacy. They demonstrated a commitment to the black community. Fletcher's Philadelphia Plan under Richard Nixon's presidency increased the opportunities for minorities and women to compete in the job market. The Philadelphia Plan made federal contractors meet specific goals in hiring women and minorities, the forerunner of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now, many black Republicans just enjoy unsettling people. Sound bites and big hats. Others like Rogers state that they have chosen to take the ""road less traveled."" And as I listened to him in a debate with Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) at the recent National Assn. of Black Journalists convention, I recognized the advantages of not going where the competition is fierce. For the truly politically ambitious, there appears to be an impressive list of Democratic wannabes. Why queue up behind a long line of well- established power brokers?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At that same time, however, I saw someone who was brave enough to stand up to a polite but solid wall of contempt from the black audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was never that brave. Although I was a black Republican until my father died in 1983, I only took advantage of his sweat equity. I inserted myself into the 1976 GOP convention in Kansas City and worked in the press office handling media relations for the black delegates and party leaders. In the early 1980s, because of my father and good political contacts, I was offered a public affairs position in Washington, D.C.. I was seduced by the image of power, politics and press initially, but after two weeks of trying out D.C. with interviews, meetings and receptions, I declined the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was changing and developing different political values. I observed that the era of black Republicans like my father had passed. And what I saw in its place was no longer for me. I left the party to become a Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those early days, I had considered myself a pragmatist by being Republican. Although my friends labeled me an opportunist, I rationalized that everything was a boost for my career. My commitment, however, was only to my father. Never did I reflect his loyalty to the Republican Party. Neither do the black Republicans I see today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My father had a faith in his party and its potential. He wanted to make a contribution for black people, to stand up and be counted even when it was dangerous. It was his personal honesty. It was his fine flaw.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sharon Woodson-Bryant is a Burbank freelance writer</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

To avoid charges of partisanship, let an independent third party put titles and summaries on initiatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Words matter. And when those words appear on the ballot, where space is limited and the competition for voter attention is high, they matter a lot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This has become an issue for a group of Republicans who have proposed a ballot initiative to repeal a recently passed package of gas taxes and vehicle fees. On Friday, they sued California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, claiming his office put a partisan spin on the title it gave their initiative. Instead of describing the initiative in a straightforward way, saying something like ""Repeals the gas tax,"" the title says instead: ""Eliminates recently enacted road repair and transportation funding by repealing revenues dedicated for those purposes. ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The description is accurate, as far as it goes. And even though the words ""taxes"" and ""fees"" don't appear in the title, they do appear in the summary that goes directly after the title on the signature petitions and on the ballot, if it qualifies. Anyone taking the time to read through the petition before signing it would figure out what the measure was all about.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the title is clunky and manages to avoid the simple and direct words that would clarify what the initiative actually does. Worse yet, the initiative's proponents believe that the language was made intentionally opaque to weaken the measure's support.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ballot proponents do not get to dictate the titles that go with their proposals, but there was no reason this title had to be so tortured. Does that mean the word choice was politically motivated? Not necessarily. It could merely be the result of having been written by lawyers. Ultimately, it will be up to a judge to decide whether Becerra should rewrite the title and summary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But such complaints are unnecessarily common in situations where an attorney general from one party prepares the language for a ballot initiative pushed by people in the other party. State law gives the attorney general the responsibility of writing ""true and impartial"" titles and summaries without creating ""prejudice, for or against the proposed measure."" Nevertheless, more than a couple of attorneys general have been accused of choosing -- or omitting -- words for the ballot title or summary to make a political point or to sway voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, former Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, a Republican, was sued for his decision not to include the hot button words ""<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>"" in the summary of Proposition 209, the controversial 1996 ballot measure that ended state <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs. Former Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat, was accused of bias when she wrote the summary for a pension reform proposal. Jerry Brown, when he served as attorney general, was criticized for the language he used to describe Proposition 8, the same-sex marriage initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a pretty simple solution: Give the duty to a nonpartisan third party. This idea has cropped up periodically in recent years, but hasn't gone anywhere. The most recent proposal, by Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Roseville), would reassign the writing of ballot titles and summaries to the Legislative Analyst's Office. The proposal (which would itself be in the form of a ballot initiative) was supported by California Common Cause and the League of Women Voters of California. But it was opposed by Becerra and died in its first committee hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kiley's bill may be dead, but this is an idea that ought to be given serious consideration by both parties. The LAO has done an admirable job of writing clear, concise and apolitical analyses of proposed legislation. It stands to reason the LAO would produce ballot titles and summaries with the same non-partisan balance and clarity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's bad enough that the titles of ballot measures are often vague and unhelpful. (Just consider two competing measures on the November statewide ballot: Proposition 62, titled simply ""Death Penalty,"" and Proposition 66, with the title ""Death Penalty. Procedures."" Only when voters read the summary did it become clear that one measure proposed ending the death penalty in California and the other proposed speeding it up.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters shouldn't have to wonder also if those titles are a product of political spin.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Not long after stealing one Supreme Court seat, Republicans will have a chance to fill a second and move the court further to the right.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the confirmation process could still turn out to be productive for Democrats — or it could become the worst of all worlds, both frustrating and damaging. The key now for the party and its voters is to understand the difference between those outcomes. Here’s a three-step guide to doing so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step one: Be realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump’s nominee is overwhelmingly likely to be confirmed regardless of what actions Democrats take. Republicans hold the Senate majority, and every Republican senator — yes, including Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski — has a history of voting for judges like those Trump is considering. Collins and Murkowski have a script: They make centrist-sounding statements, to shore up their images, and then vote aye.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So Democrats should go into the confirmation debate recognizing that it is almost certainly unwinnable. It will not depend on how hard Democratic leaders fight or which tactics they choose, alluring as that fantasy may be. In these polarized times, court nominations unite political parties, even more than individual issues, like, say, health care.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, Senator Elizabeth Warren called the coming nomination “the fight of our lives.” It is not. The great political fights are still ahead. When a new justice is sworn in this fall, Democrats should not declare generational defeat or turn on each other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step two: Don’t lose hope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol has spent decades studying political power and change, from the Civil War to the Tea Party and anti-Trump resistance. She believes that Kennedy’s retirement can be a clarifying moment for American liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the last half-century, conservatives have put more energy into building a movement — creating ideological institutions, grooming judges and, perhaps above all, winning local, state and congressional elections. Democrats have emphasized higher-profile politics, like the presidency and landmark court cases. Democrats can’t afford to do so anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years to come, the Supreme Court is likely to have a very conservative majority. But remember that the modern conservative movement began when the court seemed implacably liberal, under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and ’60s. “Conservatives were facing a Washington complex that horrified them,” Skocpol told me, “so they built from the bottom up.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember, too, the limits of the court’s power. On some big issues, the court is not imposing right-wing policies on the entire country. It is instead refusing to ban state-based right-wing policies — like abortion restrictions and partisan gerrymandering — that progressives consider unconstitutional. (And, by the way, the court was already doing so with Kennedy .)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Progressives can still win many of these issues. They simply will have to do so in a small-d democratic way, by winning elections — as they’ve begun to do lately . If Democrats win more governorships and state legislatures, they can keep Republicans from drawing ridiculous congressional maps and infringing on African-Americans’ voting rights — among many other things. If Democrats retake Congress this fall, they can halt the Republican legislative agenda and gain subpoena power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I realize that a post-Kennedy Supreme Court may one day start throwing out progressive legislation, as happened in the early 20th century. But that’s a fight for another day. Most experts I’ve talked to — scholars and people in politics — believe that elected politicians can prevail in a long-term struggle with unelected judges. Regardless, until Democrats win more elections, it’s a hypothetical concern. “The potential center-left majority in this country — and it’s very real — has to actually organize and elect people to office,” Skocpol says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step three: Know your strengths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democrats will be tempted to turn the next two months into a national conversation about abortion, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and other social issues that inspire liberal passion. That would be a mistake. Those are not the best issues for Democrats during a midterm campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The best issues are those on which Democrats hold a decisive advantage in public opinion . Health insurance is a good example. So are taxation, corporate power and the Trump administration’s corruption. All of these issues can be grist for a nominee’s Senate hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I’m not suggesting that Democratic senators ignore social issues. They just shouldn’t fool themselves into thinking that the country is further to the left than it is . For instance, about two-thirds of Americans believe abortion should be illegal at least sometimes, according to Gallup , and many of the strongest opponents base their votes on the issue. That’s why Republicans are happy to have these arguments .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nothing in American politics matters more right now than the outcome of the midterms. It is the difference between emboldening Trump and starting to hold him accountable. It really may be “the fight of our lives.” And unlike the confirmation battle, the midterms remain up for grabs. In the coming weeks, Democrats will be talking about the Supreme Court, but they should be thinking about the midterms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: David Leonhardt</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

Levy is executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I was chancellor of the New York City schools, I thought that if you were smart and poor, you could write your own ticket to college. I was dead wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, where I serve as executive director, reveals that only 3 percent of students at our most selective colleges come from the 25 percent of families with the lowest incomes, while 72 percent come from the richest 25 percent of families.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The unfairness of the situation is compounded by the fact that once admitted, poor students soar academically. According to our study, the poor students who do attend these elite schools graduate at equal rates and earn similarly high grades as their wealthy peers. The Cooke Foundation awards scholarships to exceptionally high-achieving low-income students; 95 percent of Cooke Scholars graduate from these selective schools with top grades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today at selective colleges we have <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for the wealthy. More than 80 percent of the nation's top higher-education institutions give a ""legacy preference"" to children of alumni. Even the ""athletic preference"" has been warped to give the rich a better shot. Football and basketball - in which poor and minority children excel in large numbers - get the most exposure, but more student-athletes get a leg up at elite institutions in sports such as squash, sailing, crew, horseback riding, fencing and water polo. There aren't many water polo coaches in the New York City school system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The academic playing field is otherwise skewed against smart poor children. The wealthy student gets a tutor (or at least a test-prep course) and can submit his or her best scores to colleges after taking the SAT or ACT multiple times. In contrast, the child of poverty gets a single test-fee waiver and takes the test only once and ""cold."" (The College Board, to its credit, has sought to address the situation by offering Khan Academy test-prep services at no charge, which, although not the equivalent of one-on-one tutoring, is at least something.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Early-admissions programs that require a student to commit to attending a school if accepted also unfairly hold back the poor. Early admission is an easier path to acceptance, worth as much as an extra 100 SAT points, according to one report . But children of poverty can't apply early, because they can't commit to a particular school until they know how much their financial aid package will be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It goes on like this. Students from poverty are also often ill-advised by their high school counselors about college options. Public school counselors are stretched too thin - each advises, on average, hundreds of students - to give each student in-depth attention. So it is hardly surprising that only 23 percent of high-achieving low-income students even apply to a selective school, compared with more than twice as many - 48 percent - high-achieving students from families with higher incomes. As a result, many students are unaware of scholarships they are qualified to receive, and therefore don't apply to these seemingly expensive selective schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While some schools do make attempts to find high-performing low-income students, the overall impact is meager. To reduce the impact of the poverty penalty levied against the brightest low- income students, we need a serious poverty preference in admissions to elite colleges and universities - amounting to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for these students. We do not advocate reducing the role of standardized tests, because admissions officers must have a way to compare students across schools. Without reducing standardized test requirements, admissions officers need to give more credit to low-income students for having achieved at a high level despite not having the advantages of enrichment courses, internships and foreign travel. This would help to level the playing field and open the door of opportunity for academically qualified students to attend schools that match their abilities. It would also provide a backdoor way to maintain ethnic diversity in colleges, particularly if the Supreme Court does away with race-conscious <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in admissions in a case pending this term involving the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When many high-achieving low-income students apply to our nation's top institutions of higher learning, they face a far harder road than more affluent students. Rather than get credit for having successfully overcome obstacles, they face an even more arduous path. All young people in the United States should have a fair chance at academic success, based on true merit, regardless of how much money their parents have. Having wealthy parents doesn't make you smarter or more deserving of college admission. It just means you won the parent lottery.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Harold O.

Keep that in mind as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems like an easy case. How could a federal statute designed to end the historic suppression of African American voting not be constitutional? The 15th Amendment gives voters of all races equal rights and expressly grants Congress the power to enforce those rights -- which Congress exercised by reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act (VRA) for 25 years in 2006.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The vote was 98 to 0 in the Senate and 390 to 33 in the House; a conservative Republican president from Texas, George W. Bush, signed the legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If judicial restraint means anything, surely it counsels Supreme Court affirmation of the VRA -- against the pending challenge by Shelby County, Ala., which says it has basically ended voter discrimination so Congress has no right to subject it, or other mostly Southern jurisdictions, to Justice Department ""pre-clearance"" of its election rules, as prescribed in Section 5 of the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Judge David Tatel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit wrote for the majority of a three-judge panel last year,""in this context, we owe much deference to the considered judgment of the People's elected representatives.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's the problem: Although hugely successful at securing the franchise for individual black voters, the Voting Rights Act has had corrosive unintended consequences, including, ironically, greater political polarization along racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As construed by courts, modified by Congress and enforced by the Justice Department, the act all but requires covered jurisdictions to maximize the concentration of African American and other minority voters in legislative districts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In theory, this enables minorities to elect candidates ""of their choice."" In practice, it divides many states into a small number of majority-black districts, which usually pick liberal African American Democrats, and a larger number of overwhelmingly white districts, which choose conservative white Republicans. Moderates get squeezed out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Voting Rights Act is one reason House debates so often pit upstart tea party Republicans from Southern suburbs against veteran African American Democrats from Southern cities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Civil rights organizations defend the legislation's current incarnation as if the risks to minority enfranchisement were unchanged since 1965. This is understandable. Much as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in universities helped build a middle class after segregation, ""opportunity districts"" for minority candidates helped create a cadre of black elected officials. The act's pre-clearance showed continuing relevance as a check on potentially discriminatory voter ID laws in Texas and South Carolina.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the law too often produces anomalies such as the 2003 case Georgia v. Ashcroft, in which civil rights organizations sided with a Republican Justice Department against a state redistricting plan on the grounds that it did not create enough majority-minority districts -- even though Georgia's African America Democratic officeholders overwhelmingly supported the plan because they wanted to spread black votes, and influence, more widely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the most part, minority voters no longer face the kind of blunt denial of voting rights that gave rise to the 1965 act; in 2012, blacks voted at a higher rate than whites, according to a Pew Research center analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In such a world, the corrosive political effects of racial gerrymandering under the VRA loom larger -- even compared with the benefits to minority candidates. The creation of safe minority districts put a floor under the number of blacks elected but also, arguably, a ceiling over how high they can rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the South, the message and ideology that win in a majority-minority district rarely work at the (majority-white) statewide level.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress didn't really tackle such issues when it extended the Voting Rights Act in 2006. Small wonder: Incumbents of both parties and all races owe their positions to the current system. A shake-up of the status quo might have exposed them, and then-President Bush, to election-year charges of racial insensitivity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fact is, by 2006 the Supreme Court had expressed concerns about the real-world consequences of the Voting Rights Act in several cases,and it has again since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It should surprise no one if the Roberts Court invokes precedent requiring that federal impositions on the states be ""congruent and proportional"" to the civil rights violations they remedy, and it strikes down, or guts, pre-clearance -- holding that rules based on mid-1960s political realities are simply out of sync with the 21st century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would be a pretty activist ruling.

Critics, of whom there are many, call it an overpriced indulgence for the affluent few who do not have to worry about earning a living upon graduation. Fewer and fewer of today's undergraduates are pursuing the liberal arts, with most of them studying practical subjects like finance, marketing, real estate and pharmacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But James O. Freedman, 67, the retired president of Dartmouth, remains more committed than ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Liberal education opens our eyes to what life is principally about,'' he said. ''It's about understanding yourself and having some resources to deal with everything life throws at you. It's about developing a moral compass and some understanding of how society works, how democracies work.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At home in Cambridge, with his new book, ''Liberal Education and the Public Interest'' (University of Iowa Press, 2003), an ode to the value of liberal education, on the coffee table in front of him, Mr. Freedman makes his case with passion. Contrary to what critics might say, when it comes to getting a job in today's economy, Mr. Freedman says a liberal education is an important advantage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''A liberal education is what teaches people how to write and how to think and makes them much more valuable in the job market over a 40-year career than graduates of a preprofessional program,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''All the employers will tell you that they're seeking the flexibility of mind that a liberal education imbues.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His book came out in January, as he was battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system. The chemotherapy he has been undergoing since September is working.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the fall, with a tumor pressing against the nerves of his lower back, he was using a wheelchair. Now, he needs only a cane to navigate the stairs of the Victorian home he shares with his wife, Sheba.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is Mr. Freedman's fourth bout with cancer since 1994, and just as he writes in his book that a liberal education enables us to see life more clearly, so has he looked clearly at his illness. The odds are that it will return again in a year, he says, and while he hopes to watch his three small grandchildren grow up, he says, there is no way of knowing just how many years he has.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is focusing, as ever, on writing, and speaking out for the liberal values that he has spent his lifetime working for and that he now sees eroding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Life is what we are doing now,'' he writes in his book, reflecting upon the importance of an early commitment to the values of liberal arts, equal education, idealism and public service.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his desk upstairs are a thousand pages of his fourth book: a memoir that moves from his growing up as the son of a high school English teacher in Manchester, N.H., to his undergraduate days at Harvard, where, he says, he was too timid and conventional to be a brilliant student, and on to Yale Law School, where he blossomed intellectually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The book ends at age 27, when he was a law clerk for Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, one of his heroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman put his knowledge of the law to use recently, when, as a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, he helped prepare a brief for the United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The future of America depends on educating minority men and women,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his 11 years as president of Dartmouth, Mr. Freedman devoted himself to making the college welcoming to what he called the creative loners, cellists, poets and mathematicians, as well as athletes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also carved out a role as a public intellectual, standing up to a group of right-wing students -- and their prominent, adult benefactors -- who were ridiculing blacks, homosexuals, women and Jews on campus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making their views known through the neoconservative, off-campus Dartmouth Review, the students ran a front page cartoon that showed Mr. Freedman, who is Jewish, dressed like Adolf Hitler. Eventually, tolerance and civility were restored.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last September, concerned by news reports that Jewish students were being intimidated on campuses amid protests over the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Freedman helped collect signatures from 310 college presidents for a statement calling for ''intimidation-free'' campuses. Some presidents criticized the statement for focusing only on Jewish students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With heavy snow falling on the streets of Cambridge, Mr. Freedman was relaxing in his living room, with Sheba, his wife of nearly 40 years, across from him. They were surrounded by some of Mr. Freedman's 2,000 favorite books, by T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, Saul Bellow, Faulkner, Joyce.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lifelong book collector, Mr. Freedman reluctantly parted with 4,000 other favorites when he left Dartmouth -- and the library at the president's house -- for Cambridge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward evening, the doorbell rang. Howard Gardner, the Harvard educational psychologist who is one of Mr. Freedman's closest friends, came in from the snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In retirement, as an elder statesman of academia, Mr. Freedman's advice is sought frequently. Professor Gardner wanted to consult with him about three academics who needed jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman is ''the ultimate search engine,'' Professor Gardner said, ''because he knows so many people, in so many ways, heart, mind, spirit.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Life is unpredictable and full of disappointment, Mr. Freedman writes in his book, the breakup of marriages, death of loved ones, enduring illness. In such a world, he writes, ''how ought one to lead a life?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''That is one of the questions that a liberal education addresses,'' he writes. ''The most effective protection against the contingencies of experience are values that appeal to our very best natures and anchor us most securely in the ocean of fate.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are the kinds of subjects Dr. Donald Kaufman, one of Mr. Freedman's oncologists, says he enjoys discussing with the former college president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''I always reserve 30 minutes for his visits,'' Dr. Kaufman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''They go on for 90. This is for my benefit, not his. He's teaching me what it means to be a patient. He's teaching people how to live.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James O. Freedman, right, the retired president of Dartmouth, with his friend Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist. Mr. Freedman's new book contends that when it comes to getting a job, a well-rounded education is a major advantage. (C. J. Gunther for The New York Times)</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

Baker III, a Maryland state legislator from Cheverly in Prince George's County, was ""a little taken aback"" when a former ambassador and a deputy assistant secretary of state showed up in Annapolis to lobby him last week. Their mission: to block a Baker proposal to impose sanctions against companies that do business in Nigeria, a wanton human-rights abuser in Africa.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State Department officials, like those from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, increasingly are finding that they have to negotiate with Americans as well as their foreign counterparts. From Massachusetts to California to New York City, local initiative and foreign policy are coming into conflict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is America's thickening connections with the world. ""You have to go back to George Washington's day to find a time when the United States was as dependent on foreign trade and investment as it is today,"" says Alan Larson, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs and the boss of last week's emissaries to Annapolis. In 1970 imports and exports were equivalent to 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product; today they're up to 30 percent. U.S. investments overseas, and foreign investments here, also have soared.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's not just a question of volume. As ties grow, the United States increasingly is trying to shape other countries' societies. Trade talks used to focus on tariffs, duties, anti-dumping provisions and other matters that only trade lawyers understood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. officials focus on what they call ""non-tariff barriers"": corruption, inadequate antitrust law, even zoning-like regulations that may work against U.S. products. In Europe, the United States is fighting health laws that keep out U.S. beef. In Japan, the United States attacks laws that help preserve neighborhoods by shielding small shops from competition -- but also make life difficult for U.S. exporters. U.S. labor unions want the administration to pressure other nations to allow collective bargaining.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, other nations don't always welcome these initiatives. Even less surprisingly, they have their own ideas about how the United States should organize itself. To win the right to challenge foreign barriers before international judges, America has had to subject itself to the same rules. Baker says he modeled his anti-Nigeria law on state laws that helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But in the intervening years, the United States has signed on to treaties that preclude such laws -- and that give other nations the right to demand compensation from Washington if their firms are barred in Maryland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no question, the State Department's Larson says, that the stuff of international negotiation today tends tend to ""get into your living room"" more than in the past. He should know; he's point man for a treaty-in-progress known as the Multilateral Agreement on Investments. Under negotiation for 2 1/2 years, this far-reaching pact would in most cases bind nations to treat foreign companies as they do their own, so that firms can invest across borders without fear of expropriation or unfair favoritism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The MAI hasn't yet attracted much attention in Washington. But it's the object of fevered opposition on talk radio and in some corners of the Internet. In the preface to a recently published tract, ""MAI and the Threat to American Freedom,"" Lori Wallach and Ralph Nader describe the proposed treaty as ""enormously secretive and powerful"" and ""a slow-motion coup d'etat against democratic governance in the United States, Canada and abroad. . . . ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to being secretive, the entire soporific text is available on the Web site of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, under whose auspices the negotiations are taking place (www.oecd.org). But opponents are more persuasive when they list decisions they say could be taken out of Americans' hands. Since MAI would forbid countries from demanding a certain level of investment, wouldn't the Community Reinvestment Act -- which says banks must invest in low-income neighborhoods -- be thrown out? Since the treaty bans anything ""tantamount"" to expropriation, couldn't a foreign tobacco company challenge advertising restrictions that reduce the value of its investment? What about state laws that limit hunting licenses or farmland ownership to locals, minority contractor set-asides, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, right-to-work laws?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials say none of these would be affected. Government procurement would be exempted, all state and local laws would be grandfathered, the ""tantamount"" language would be amended to underscore the inviolability of legitimate health, environmental and safety regulation. Moreover, they argue that MAI would help American workers, because U.S. firms in today's economy need to operate effectively abroad to remain healthy at home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Clinton administration, still smarting from the defeat of fast-track trade legislation, isn't pushing MAI too hard. The original plan was to wrap up talks by May; now U.S. officials say they need at least another year, and they'll oppose any firm deadline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More to the point, they have learned from fast-track that they have to consult, while treaties are still being shaped, more than ever before -- with unions, local officials, environmentalists and others. The more the scope of trade talks goes beyond tariffs, the less they can be left exclusively to trade officials.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, as State Department officials know from their work in foreign capitals, consultation doesn't guarantee agreement. ""The State Department testimony only helped me more,"" says Baker. ""They admitted that what's going on in Nigeria is terrible -- and they couldn't point to much that they are doing about it."" Before it's over for U.S. diplomats, Annapolis may make Pyongyang look easy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is a member of the editorial page staff.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
652ee4c19af20c91c9d88a65	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2414754878.xml.txt	"<div><p>Roberts to Trump: Don’t Take the Supreme Court for Granted</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A week of decisions contained hidden and not-so-hidden messages from the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suppose there had been a leak from the Supreme Court early Thursday morning: The court was about to issue its long-awaited decision in the DACA case on the fate of nearly 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers; the vote was 5 to 4; and the majority opinion was by Chief Justice John Roberts. But the leaker didn’t know, or wouldn’t say, which way the case came out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Dreamers and their supporters, hearts would have been in their throats. This was the chief justice, after all, who two years ago wrote the opinion upholding President Trump’s Muslim travel ban, and who five years before that wrote the opinion dismantling the Voting Rights Act. The vote in both was 5 to 4. Why wouldn’t the conservative chief justice defer to the president’s decision to end a program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that his predecessor had instituted by executive action without even seeking Congress’s approval?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president’s allies would have had ample reason to be anxious. Wasn’t this the chief justice who just a year ago wrote the majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 blocked the president’s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census? The proposal failed the essential requirement of administrative law for “reasoned decision making,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote in that case. He dismissed the administration’s proffered good-government rationale as pretextual; or, as the dictionary puts it, “dubious or spurious.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, of course, we know that it was the Chief Justice Roberts of the census decision, which an enraged President Trump came within inches of defying, who arrived on the scene in time to save the Dreamers. His opinion assured readers that in holding that the administration’s effort to undo DACA was invalid, the court was not endorsing the program. That is conventional administrative law talk — and the case, as the chief justice framed it, was a conventional one about administrative procedure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration’s explanation for why it was terminating DACA — explained in a single sentence by an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (“Taking into consideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated”) — was so inadequate as to make the decision “arbitrary and capricious,” Chief Justice Roberts said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the department came up with a more elaborate explanation nine months later in response to an unfavorable Federal District Court ruling, the chief justice said that it was a “foundational principle of administrative law” that an agency, once challenged, has to defend its action on the grounds it initially invoked, not on an after-the-fact rationalization, unless it wants to restart from scratch the process of arriving at a decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dry procedural language of the opinion, including its invitation to the Trump administration to start over and find a new way to defend terminating DACA, seems to have lulled many readers into assuming that the victory for the Dreamers is less than complete. No doubt many eyes had glazed over by Page 24, when the chief justice began a crucial discussion of the “reliance interests” in favor of continuing the program that permits DACA recipients to live and work lawfully in the only country that most of them have ever known.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Citing statistics in briefs filed by, among others, a group of 143 businesses, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that those with a stake in continuing the program included not only the Dreamers themselves but also their families, “including their 200,000 U.S.-citizen children,” “employers who have invested time and money in training them” and state and local governments that would lose tax revenue from DACA recipients’ earnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Administrative law requires the agency to take reliance interests into account, Chief Justice Roberts said. “DHS may determine, in the particular context before it, that other interests and policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests,” he said, adding, “Making that difficult decision was the agency’s job, but the agency failed to do it.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And can the Trump administration do it now? Theoretically yes, under still another acting homeland security secretary, but any newly justified rescission announcement would find the administration back in court within hours, the clock ticking all the while toward Election Day. Although the chief justice nominally left it up to the administration to weigh the reliance interests against its policy goal, his exposition of the strength of those interests sets a very high bar for this or any subsequent administration to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where was the other Chief Justice Roberts this week, the one of the disastrous Shelby County v. Holder voting rights decision and of the travel ban decision? Was the Chief Justice Roberts who silently joined Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion bringing L.G.B.T.Q. people within the protection of federal anti-discrimination law the same chief justice who wrote a snarky dissenting opinion five years ago when the court upheld the constitutional right to same-sex marriage?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contemplating this head-snapping week at the Supreme Court, I’m reminded of the amazing 2002-2003 term, when the court under another conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist, seemed to pull its robust conservatism up short. In the space of a few weeks in the spring of 2003, the court upheld <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in higher education; granted constitutional protection to gay men and lesbians for their private sexual lives; and upheld the application of the family-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act to state employees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Rehnquist himself was in dissent in the first two of those cases, but he surprised nearly everyone by writing the majority opinion in the third, a case that may sound obscure now but that effectively spelled an end to the federalism revolution on which, under the chief justice’s leadership, the court had been embarked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could have accounted for that surprising turn of events at the dawn of the new century? Wrestling with that question, I eventually concluded that the court was realigning itself, as it has done historically, with its own sense of what the public wanted and expected from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“No great Supreme Court case is only a question of law,” I wrote then. “It is always also an episode in the ongoing dialogue by which the court engages with the society in which it operates and in which the justices live.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just so with this week’s cases. Monday’s ruling on the right of gay and transgender people to be free of discrimination in the workplace showed a court that by a refreshing vote of 6 to 3 decided not to stand in the path of a tide of social change. The DACA decision contained a message threaded through its dry language of administrative procedure — a warning to the Trump administration not to assume that it gets a free pass, not to take the Supreme Court for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“This is not the case for cutting corners,” the chief justice wrote. That’s a sentence sure to be echoing in the halls of the solicitor general’s office, where Chief Justice Roberts once worked and where he honed his ability to speak to the Supreme Court. Now, with four colleagues to his left and four to his right, he speaks for the court from a center chair that must often feel like a lonely place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the decisions due in the next few weeks on abortion, religion, the president’s tax returns and the Electoral College, among other cases, it’s too soon to place a label on this pandemic-disrupted Supreme Court term. The justices will issue decisions that will infuriate, reassure, surprise and even break hearts, as they evidently broke Senator Josh Hawley’s on Monday. The Missouri Republican took to the Senate floor to bemoan “the end of the conservative legal movement.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as the ambitious young senator, a former law clerk to Chief Justice Roberts, surely knows, there is no end, only a new beginning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

652ee4c19af20c91c9d88a65	aa_opeds_sample/txt/900173941.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Ugliness Started With Bork</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Oct. 23, 1987 -- 24 years ago on Sunday -- Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court was voted down by the Senate. All but two Democrats voted ""nay.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rejection of a Supreme Court nominee is unusual but not unheard of (see Clement Haynsworth Jr.). But rarely has a failed nominee had the pedigree -- and intellectual firepower -- of Bork. He had been a law professor at Yale, the solicitor general of the United States and, at the time Ronald Reagan tapped him for the court, a federal appeals court judge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, Bork was a legal intellectual, a proponent of original intent and judicial restraint. The task of the judge, he once wrote, is ""to discern how the framers' values, defined in the context of the world they knew, apply to the world we know."" He said that Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion, was a ""wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation"" of authority that belonged to the states, that the court's recent rulings on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> were problematic and that the First Amendment didn't apply to pornography.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whatever you think of these views, they cannot be fairly characterized as extreme; Ruth Bader Ginsburg, among many others, has questioned the rationale offered by the court to justify Roe v. Wade. Nor was Bork himself an extremist. He was a strongly opinionated, somewhat pugnacious, deeply conservative judge. (At 84 today, he hasn't mellowed much either, to judge from an interview he recently gave Newsweek.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I bring up Bork not only because Sunday is a convenient anniversary. His nomination battle is also a reminder that our poisoned politics is not just about Republicans behaving badly, as many Democrats and their liberal allies have convinced themselves. Democrats can be -- and have been -- every bit as obstructionist, mean-spirited and unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'll take it one step further. The Bork fight, in some ways, was the beginning of the end of civil discourse in politics. For years afterward, conservatives seethed at the ""systematic demonization"" of Bork, recalls Clint Bolick, a longtime conservative legal activist. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution coined the angry verb ""to bork,"" which meant to destroy a nominee by whatever means necessary. When Republicans borked the Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright less than two years later, there wasn't a trace of remorse, not after what the Democrats had done to Bork. The anger between Democrats and Republicans, the unwillingness to work together, the profound mistrust -- the line from Bork to today's ugly politics is a straight one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is, to be sure, completely understandable that the Democrats wanted to keep Bork off the court. Lewis Powell, the great moderate, was stepping down, which would be leaving the court evenly divided between conservatives and liberals. There was tremendous fear that if Bork were confirmed, he would swing the court to the conservatives and important liberal victories would be overturned -- starting with Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But liberals couldn't just come out and say that. ""If this were carried out as an internal Senate debate,"" Ann Lewis, the Democratic activist, would later acknowledge, ""we would have deep and thoughtful discussions about the Constitution, and then we would lose."" So, instead, the Democrats sought to portray Bork as ""a right-wing loony,"" to use a phrase in a memo written by the Advocacy Institute, a liberal lobby group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The character assassination began the day Bork was nominated, when Ted Kennedy gave a fiery speech describing ""Robert Bork's America"" as a place ""in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters,"" and so on. It continued until the day the nomination was voted down; one ad, for instance, claimed, absurdly, that Bork wanted to give ""women workers the choice between sterilization and their job.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives were stunned by the relentlessness -- and the essential unfairness -- of the attacks. But the truth is that many of the liberals fighting the nomination also knew they were unfair. That same Advocacy Institute memo noted that, ""Like it or not, Bork falls (perhaps barely) at the borderline of respectability."" It didn't matter. He had to be portrayed ""as an extreme ideological activist."" The ends were used to justify some truly despicable means.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, of course, the court has a conservative majority, and liberal victories are, indeed, being overturned. Interestingly, Bolick says Bork's beliefs would have made him a restraining force. Theodore Olson, who served as solicitor general under George W. Bush, also pointed out that after Bork, nominees would scarcely acknowledge that they had rich and nuanced judicial philosophies for fear of giving ammunition to the other side. Those philosophies would be unveiled only after they were on the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mostly, though, the point remains this: The next time a liberal asks why Republicans are so intransigent, you might suggest that the answer lies in the mirror.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes
652ee4c19af20c91c9d88a65	aa_opeds_sample/txt/432991807.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Battle Behind the Battle at Harvard</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James Atlas is the president of Atlas Books.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WHEN Lawrence Summers, president of Harvard, theorized last month at a conference on ''Diversifying the Science and Engineering Work Force'' that men might have an innate advantage over women in scientific aptitude, he could scarcely have anticipated the protests that unfolded last week on the university's campus. While the Coalition for an Anti-Sexist Harvard rallied outside the science center, a hastily formed group with the laid-back name Students for Larry was milling about Lowell Lecture Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the crisis wasn't just about Larry Summers. Gendergate -- to give the scandal its obligatory suffix -- was more than a matter of an impolitic president. At stake is the university's very identity: Is Harvard liberal or conservative?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one associated with the university, of course, would ever admit to thinking about it that way. How could such basic terms fit, given Harvard's image of itself as an institution that celebrates independence of beliefs and political affiliations as the essence of its charter? And not without justification: It can tenure Harvey Mansfield, the professor of government famous for his politically incorrect pronouncements, and Hilary Putnam, the philosophy professor who was handing out Progressive Labor pamphlets 35 years ago and seems not to have changed his mind on any issue since?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet why should we expect Harvard, and Harvard alone, to rise above the fray? Every issue on campus, just like every issue on every other campus, is refracted through the lens of left-right politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The number of tenured women professors there? Shockingly low, and it must be fixed by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, liberals insist. The result of fewer women getting on tenure track early in their careers, conservatives retort.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expansion of the campus to Allston? An imperial land grab, the liberals say, that ignores the needs of the surrounding community. A way to create a vibrant Silicon Valley on the Charles, conservatives argue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this way, the conflagration at Harvard simply mirrors the other wars happening elsewhere -- most recently at Hamilton College, which became embroiled in a debate over a University of Colorado professor's right to call the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks ''little Eichmanns.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harvard being Harvard, any debate it provokes is certain to draw widespread attention. But there is also this crucial difference: the conservative agitator is not an outsider, but an insider. In this case, the president himself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not that Mr. Summers thinks of himself as a conservative. He was Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and before that, chief economist of the World Bank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's made Mr. Summers so controversial, said Nicholas Lemann, a Harvard graduate and now the dean of Columbia University's journalism school, is that he's conservative ''not in his politics, but in the context of the university.'' ''Just about everything he's done that's gotten attention is about a tug to the center,'' Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is to say, he would like to see R.O.T.C., which was banished from Harvard during the sit-ins of the 60's, restored to campus; he would like to overhaul the core curriculum; he would like to hire who he pleases, regardless of race or sex.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By being naturally and deliberately provocative, he has challenged campus liberals, which is not what campus liberals are accustomed to. Neil Rudenstine, the previous president, was a former English major devoted to inclusivity. Derek Bok, who preceded Mr. Rudenstine, was an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> proponent, even writing a book after he left office on the merits of race-based preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, Mr. Summers has had a series of widely reported confrontations: He rebuked Cornel West, a distinguished professor in the African-American studies department, who promptly decamped to Princeton; he made the suggestion, provoked by a pro-Palestinian faction demanding that Harvard divest itself of stock in companies allied with Israel, that campus anti-Semitism was on the rise; he deplored rampant grade inflation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The right attributed his problems to ''feminists'' furthering their ''career agendas,'' as Professor Mansfield put it: ''That he's not in favor of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, that's what this whole thing is about.'' The left complained that he was a dictatorial bully.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the considerable endowment -- now about $23 billion -- is subject to a left-right critique. Liberals want to know why more of that money isn't used for scholarships and faculty research. And why, they ask, are top money managers earning Wall Street-size bonuses? Critics of what some refer to as ''the corporatization of Harvard'' point to the university's acquisition of significant real estate holdings in Allston as symptomatic of the trend. For decades now, Harvard has been buying land across the river from the main campus, and now owns 260 acres there, leaving the university open to the charge that it has pursued a policy of expansion out of sheer acquisitiveness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Harvard started out as a public school,'' notes Lani Guinier, a Harvard law professor and the author of a forthcoming book titled ''Meritocracy Incorporated.'' ''It was given land by the state of Massachusetts. Harvard was a proprietor of Cambridge, charged with the responsibility of answering to the needs of the community. It's one thing to be the wealthiest landowner in the community, but you have to be responsible.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some extent, the campus rift is not about politics, but about a wrenching of power from the faculty. When Mr. Summers was appointed in 2001, he had, or believed he had, a mandate to make the university more efficient by exerting his control over it. ''He's interested in everything,'' says Kim Clark, dean of the Harvard Business School. ''How it runs its real estate operation, how it manages its food service, how it allocates resources.''

Harvard has weathered turbulence before in its 370-year history. Not even the travails of a president who seems to lack a superego can match the drama of that dawn in the spring of 1969 when President Nathan Pusey called in state troopers to oust students who had occupied University Hall; no one present will ever forget the cloud of tear gas wafting over Harvard Yard at five o'clock in the morning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the issues the university faces -- the fate of the new Allston campus, the overhaul of the curriculum, the proper use of the endowment -- are hardly minor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real question isn't whether Mr. Summers should stay or go, but how these inevitable transformations will play out over the next few years.

55524d56fdf99b0152c81fef	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2417314051.xml.txt	"<div><p>Op-Ed: Why California needs affirmative action more than ever</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In November, a new generation of California voters will have the opportunity to restore <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in the state. Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 will be on the ballot, giving voters the chance to repeal Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education in 1996, nearly a quarter of a century ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hail ACA 5 as a way to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic and gender inequalities, while opponents decry it as a form of categorical discrimination that privileges race and gender over merit. One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This view is wrong — the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard’s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard’s tenured professors are white — 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the “Chinese virus” and most recently “kung flu.” Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It’s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never “leveled the playing field,” but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

The great secret is out: Liberals dominate campuses. Coming soon: ""Moon Implicated in Tides, Studies Find.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One study of 1,000 professors finds that Democrats outnumber Republicans at least seven to one in the humanities and social sciences. That imbalance, more than double what it was three decades ago, is intensifying because younger professors are more uniformly liberal than the older cohort that is retiring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another study, of voter registration records, including those of professors in engineering and the hard sciences, found nine Democrats for every Republican at Berkeley and Stanford. Among younger professors, there were 183 Democrats, six Republicans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we essentially knew this even before the American Enterprise magazine reported in 2002 on examinations of voting records in various college communities. Some findings about professors registered with the two major parties or with liberal or conservative minor parties:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cornell: 166 liberals, 6 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stanford: 151 liberals, 17 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Colorado: 116 liberals, 5 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UCLA: 141 liberals, 9 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics reports that in 2004, of the top five institutions in terms of employee per capita contributions to presidential candidates, the third, fourth and fifth were Time Warner, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft. The top two were the University of California system and Harvard, both of which gave about 19 times more money to John Kerry than to George W. Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at Berkeley, denies that academic institutions are biased against conservatives. The disparity in hiring, he explains, occurs because conservatives are not as interested as liberals in academic careers. Why does he think liberals are like that? ""Unlike conservatives, they believe in working for the public good and social justice."" That clears that up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A filtering process, from graduate school admissions through tenure decisions, tends to exclude conservatives from what Mark Bauerlein calls academia's ""sheltered habitat."" In a dazzling essay in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Bauerlein, professor of English at Emory University and director of research and analysis at the National Endowment for the Arts, notes that the ""first protocol"" of academic society is the ""common assumption"" -- that, at professional gatherings, all the strangers in the room are liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a reasonable assumption, given that in order to enter the profession, your work must be deemed, by the criteria of the prevailing culture, ""relevant."" Bauerlein says that various academic fields now have regnant premises that embed political orientations in their very definitions of scholarship:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Schools of education, for instance, take constructivist theories of learning as definitive, excluding realists (in matters of knowledge) on principle, while the quasi-Marxist outlook of cultural studies rules out those who espouse capitalism. If you disapprove of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, forget pursuing a degree in African-American studies. If you think that the nuclear family proves the best unit of social well-being, stay away from women's studies.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This gives rise to what Bauerlein calls the ""false consensus effect,"" which occurs when, because of institutional provincialism, ""people think that the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population."" There also is what Cass Sunstein, professor of political science and jurisprudence at the University of Chicago, calls ""the law of group polarization."" Bauerlein explains: ""When like-minded people deliberate as an organized group, the general opinion shifts toward extreme versions of their common beliefs."" They become tone-deaf to the way they sound to others outside their closed circle of belief.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When John Kennedy brought to Washington such academics as Arthur Schlesinger Jr., John Kenneth Galbraith, McGeorge and William Bundy and Walt Rostow, it was said that the Charles River was flowing into the Potomac. Actually, Richard Nixon's administration had an even more distinguished academic cast -- Henry Kissinger, Pat Moynihan, Arthur Burns, James Schlesinger and others.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Academics such as the next secretary of state still decorate Washington, but academia is less listened to than it was. It has marginalized itself, partly by political shrillness and silliness that have something to do with the parochialism produced by what George Orwell called ""smelly little orthodoxies.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many campuses are intellectual versions of one-party nations -- except such nations usually have the merit, such as it is, of candor about their ideological monopolies. In contrast, American campuses have more insistently proclaimed their commitment to diversity as they have become more intellectually monochrome.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They do indeed cultivate diversity -- in race, skin color, ethnicity, sexual preference.

55524d56fdf99b0152c81fef	aa_opeds_sample/txt/431493919.xml.txt	"<div><p>A Lesson In Bigotry And Liberty</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THIS town, which served as a headquarters of the Revolutionary Army, usually celebrates the Fourth of July with a dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence, complete with muskets and tricorn hats. But this year, Morristown also had a live-action drama showcasing those unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The action began when a white supremacist from Mississippi won the right in court to hold a rally here yesterday. Richard Barrett, whose Nationalist Movement oath declares ''the white race is the superlative civilizer,'' said he chose Morristown because of its history. Just as George Washington ''said no to the privileges of the king, today we're saying no to the privileges of minorities,'' he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett got what he wanted yesterday -- helmeted police protecting his right to march on Washington Street, a crowd of angry counter-protesters that drew pepper spray and 10 arrests. A perfect forum for a man with bullhorn and bombast. Mr. Barrett brought to town an anemic anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> protest and a racist version of the Declaration of Independence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But on Monday night, as Mr. Barrett prepared to deliver his divisive message, Morristown made its elegant statement. About 1,000 people filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't have done it without him. ''We are here tonight to reject any notion that one race is superior to another,'' Calvary's pastor, the Rev. Jerry Carter, said to cheers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The service and a candlelight march to the Morristown Green were arranged at the urging of the mayor, John J. DeLaney Jr., who was looking for a way to counter Mr. Barrett without giving him the satisfaction of a confrontation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The town has about 17,000 residents --  about 15 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic -- and just around the corner from Calvary church is evidence that all is not harmonious. Outside a house, a sign commemorates the death of a black resident who was killed last year by the police in a neighboring town. Prosecutors cleared the officers, but, for some, his death remains an example of racial profiling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MONDAY night, though, was a display of racial accord. Rabbi David Nesson of Morristown's Jewish Community Center reminded the crowd that Washington once wrote to a synagogue in Newport, R.I., that one of the country's guiding ideals was ''to give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jakki Dumas-Footman, 33, a financial analyst, said she felt compelled to come to the service with her daughter even though she grew up black in a largely white Morristown neighborhood and rarely felt racism. ''I've never seen a K.K.K. march,'' she said. ''I brought my daughter. She knows about the K.K.K. I want her to see it. This is our history, in a way.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nate Moore, a 58-year-old computer consultant, came Monday night remembering that history from having grown up black in Alabama. Mr. Barrett's message ''really astounded me,'' he said. ''I really thought these days were passed.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The songs of equality at the church recalled the old days, Mr. Moore said, but there were more white faces in the pews,  and the ranks of racists were thinner. ''I think you have to accept the differences and move on,'' he said. ''I think that's what we're doing more of -- accepting the differences and moving on.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But moving on is not a straight course.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monday night's harmony gave way to yesterday's ugliness. Mr. Barrett's sad parade of eight followers was separated from an angry crowd of about 250 by barricades and helmeted police on horses. At the height of the event, protesters from groups including the Progressive Labor Party were hurling vile taunts at the police as some protesters knocked down barricades and threw golf balls and batteries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asa Watkins, an 83-year-old artist from Morristown, had come to oppose Mr. Barrett, but was taken aback by the anger on both sides.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Watkins was reminded that Washington had spent two treacherous winters in Morristown on the way to victory. This Fourth of July freedom had another tough, but victorious, round in Morristown. ''It's a messy process, democracy is,'' said Mr. Watkins, leaving the rally. ''It always is.''</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

Nonetheless, liberals shouldn't pretend that academia is untouched by political prejudices. Conservatives do face some bias and are wildly underrepresented in the social sciences; enough, perhaps, to warrant new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a recent study, only 6.6% of professors in the social sciences self-identify as Republicans (compared with 24.2% in business, 23.3% in engineering, and 22.9% in the health sciences). In sociology, Marxists outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1. Conservative professors are, then, less well represented in the social sciences than women and people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This imbalance is partly attributable to the fact that conservative students steer clear of the social sciences well before they consider graduate programs. One study found that students' politics is among the very best predictors of their undergraduate major choice, with conservatives tending to select the natural sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's possible that these conservative undergraduates simply prefer the natural sciences -- some evidence, for example, suggests that they are slightly more focused on financial success than are liberals. But it's also germane that conservatives feel uncomfortable in classes that touch on politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A climate survey conducted by the University of Colorado found that Republican students were more than three times as likely as their Democratic peers to feel intimidated when sharing their political ideas in class. Another study found that students active in campus conservative groups avoid coursework in the social sciences -- an especially striking discovery given these students' self-evidently strong interest in social and political issues. A third study found that conservatives report less satisfaction with their coursework in the social sciences than do liberal students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've also found that right-leaning PhD students seem to avoid the most politicized subfields in the social sciences. One young political scientist, for example, told us that she would have preferred to study the Middle East, but opted for a safer subfield instead: ""I didn't do the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which was the thing I wanted to do."" As one professor of the ancient world -- a safe subfield in history -- explained more generally: ""If you're a conservative, there [are] such huge no-go zones.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one exception -- that proves the rule -- is economics. Economics has a long history of openness to thinkers on both sides of the political divide and is the one social science field that actually looks like America; it has roughly equal proportions of professors who identify as Republicans, independents and Democrats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Academic sorting is especially troubling given that the university is one of the only institutions that could model civil discourse for young people in our polarized age, an example that is hard to provide with so few conservatives about. Additionally, a growing number of social scientists are recognizing that political homogeneity makes it hard for humanistic disciplines to converge on the best approximation of the truth; homogenous fields not only generate a narrower range of research interests and interpretations, they are also plagued by confirmation bias -- our tendency to accept findings and theories that fit our assumptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One liberal argument for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is sympathetic to these very points. In his 1978 opinion on Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. noted that truth is discovered ""out of a multitude of tongues."" (He was quoting an earlier decision on another topic.) If Justice Powell is right -- if the primary purpose of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is to increase the variety of tongues -- then we should increase conservative ones too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some might reasonably object that the real purpose of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is to remedy historical discrimination. Universities, however, have long emphasized the virtues of diversity over remedial justice. In fact, liberals embraced the diversity rationale in the 1970s partly because it allowed them to extend <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> to new groups -- especially women -- with far weaker historical grievances than African Americans. Today, universities are so committed to diversity -- not remedial justice -- that they are now practicing <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for men so that their campuses don't become even more dominated by female students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity is now the new religion of the university -- and it's one they could practice much better. We don't endorse preferences in graduate admissions and hiring. At a bare minimum, however, universities should stop barring conservative speakers from their campuses. In just the past year, for example, Williams College disinvited two conservative speakers from its ""uncomfortable learning"" series.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In hiring committees, liberal faculty might also question their natural preference for like-minded colleagues. (Progressive professors often say that they prefer to hire liberals, all else being equal.) Before they start sorting through resumes, departments might consider advertising positions in fields that are more popular among conservatives, such as military history, political history, the American founding, sociology of religion and natural law. Scholars in such fields would bring some balance to a curriculum increasingly dominated by race and gender. Finally, universities could grant visiting appointments in conservative thought, an experiment already underway at the University of Colorado.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even these modest reforms should help conservative feel much more welcome in all of academia, not just in some of its quarters. When that happens, the university will also deepen its public legitimacy -- an increasingly rare and fragile good in our polarized age. But that fine achievement depends critically on liberals. As conservative professors, we have defended the progressive university against its polemical right-wing critics. Now we are asking the university to better practice what it preaches.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jon A.

55524d56fdf99b0152c81fef	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2761519572.xml.txt	"<div><p>What Went Unsaid in the Chief Justice’s Report on the Judiciary</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, recently filed his 2022 “year-end report on the federal judiciary.” It’s more interesting for what it didn’t say than for what it did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To underscore the threatening world that judges occupy, the chief justice began by focusing on a pivotal moment in the desegregation of the nation’s schools. The 1957 attempt by the Arkansas governor Orval Faubus to block Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School led to threats of violence against the federal judge who enforced the court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. That judge, Ronald N. Davies, was “uncowed,” the chief justice wrote, despite being “physically threatened.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“A judicial system cannot and should not live in fear,” Chief Justice Roberts added as he thanked Congress for passing a law last year to protect judges. The new law was named in honor of Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, who was murdered in 2020 in an assault meant for the judge at her home. The law screens from the public the personal information of federal judges and their families, including identifiers such as license plate numbers and addresses. Leaders like the chief justice deserve praise when they highlight the dangers all public officials now face.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Focusing on the Brown decision was nonetheless surprising. After all, the court appears poised to reverse a decision upholding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in school admissions, one of the very remedies that the Brown decision spawned, and which all nine members of the court stood squarely behind in 1954 and reaffirmed in a subsequent case in 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, the chief justice sometimes used his year-end report to describe substantive reforms in the federal courts, like the task force created in 2018 in response to allegations that federal judges had harassed their staffs sexually and in other ways. Not so in his latest report, which was four pages long with a five-page appendix. Chief Justice Roberts did not mention any of the many issues that made the news about the court last year — the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices whose actions or those of family members raise questions about impartiality, the leak of a draft of the court’s decision overturning abortion rights, the insufficiency of financial disclosure and questions about fund-raising for the Supreme Court Historical Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor did the chief justice explore the troubling data in his report’s appendix on “the workload of the courts.” The numbers document a sharp decline of the use of the federal courts. Federal appellate filings fell again in the fiscal year 2022, a steady decline from 49,000 in 2018 to fewer than 42,000 last year. Trial-level civil cases in the federal district courts have fallen precipitously as well — down from more almost 283,000 cases in 2018 to about 240,000 in 2022.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In calculating totals and the trend in civil cases, court administrators did not include about 321,000 filings that, starting in 2020, were brought by military service members and veterans who claimed that combat earplugs sold by 3M to the U.S. military were faulty. Under a federal statute, those cases became, in effect, one litigation, consolidated before trial in front of a single judge, and they are an example of the importance of people having access to courts, which can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The opinions of the very court that the chief justice leads provide insight into the decline. We know from our own experience that savvy civil rights lawyers now steer clear of federal court. Winning in the appellate courts risks having the Supreme Court’s conservative majority extinguish any gains won for women, prisoners, the environment and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dwindling numbers of filings at the trial level in the U.S. District Courts also derive in part from what the Supreme Court has done during the last few decades — to close the courthouse doors to many would-be litigants, in class-action lawsuits and other cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key example can be found in the court’s interpretations of the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In a series of cases that began in the 1980s, the court has read the statute to mean that employers and businesses can include arbitration clauses in lengthy, dense, fine-print documents with consumers and employees that bar access to courts and to class actions. Even complaints of violations of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and of federal laws regulating securities, fair credit, unlawful mergers and unfair business practices can be forced into arbitration rather than being litigated in court. Anyone aggrieved has to go, one by one, to private arbitration. In practice, almost none do, because most people don’t have the resources to pursue small-value claims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, the veterans in the combat earplug cases were able to get into court because no arbitration mandate kept them out. And once in court, because of procedures designed to make group-based litigation easier, they could combine resources to pursue their arguments of hearing loss and tinnitus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The “state of the judiciary” address is a bully pulpit constructed decades ago by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Given the challenges the country faces, we need a chief justice who helps us all talk seriously about what ails the federal courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts’s focus on 1950s desegregation litigation is a poignant reminder that once federal courts led the way in protecting civil rights and making courts accessible to all. His court, however, has made plain it has no interest in opening doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that, we need Congress to reinvigorate federal rights and end the power of would-be defendants to control access. That’s what Congress did in 2022 when it amended the 1925 arbitration statute to let victims of sexual assault and harassment decide if they want to sue in court rather than consider using arbitration. The chief justice properly commended Congress for making strides in protecting federal judges. Now Congress needs to protect and support the right to bring cases to those judges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nancy Gertner, a retired Federal District Court judge, is a senior lecturer in law at Harvard Law School.

55524d56fdf99b0152c81fef	aa_opeds_sample/txt/418468478.xml.txt	"<div><p>TOLERANCE FOR UNEASY DISCUSSIONS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Blacks and Mexican-Americans are not academically competitive with whites in selective institutions,"" said law Professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas at Austin recently. ""They have a culture that seems not to encourage achievement. Failure is not looked upon with disgrace.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Talk about pushing buttons. Politicians who roam the halls of the nearby state Capitol went ballistic. ""This is not the kind of academic riffraff that our taxpayers should be supporting,"" argued an African-American state senator from Dallas. A Hispanic colleague of his wrote University of Texas Chancellor William Cunningham to argue that Graglia's remarks ""amount to cultural character assassination"" and should not ""be protected by academic freedom.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reactionary students who also value political correctness more than open debate called for Graglia's dismissal. And knees wobbling, even the law school faculty disassociated itself from their colleague's remarks. Some genuflected in the direction of free speech, to be sure, but the emphasis was on disagreeing with Graglia without actually pinpointing why.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And therein lies an important point: Today, Americans who are supposed to be the stewards of our political and academic traditions are still debating whether there should be free speech, rather than accepting that right as a given and using it as a tool for seriously addressing the major public policy questions of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In truth, Graglia's concern about the underachievement of minorities at ""selective institutions"" was not unfounded. Hispanics and blacks are not doing as well as mainstream students, a point made long ago by Hoover Institution senior fellow Thomas Sowell, who is black. Likewise, scholars have noted that certain Asian-American groups appear to have a culture that does produce high academic achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Graglia has a right to oppose <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, which was the real object of his opinions. But where he erred was in leaving room for the interpretation that minority underachievement is inescapable because minorities are by definition underachievers. Leaving aside the issue of tautologies, isn't it likely that disparate socioeconomic circumstances might be a relevant factor? Doesn't the disproportionate convergence of race and poverty have a bearing on minority achievement in America today? Isn't chronic low-skill immigration in states such as Texas to be considered as a factor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Graglia may wish to recall American history. During the third great wave of immigration to the United States earlier in this century, low-skill immigrants from places like rural Italy came in for an enormous amount of prejudice and discrimination because it was assumed that being poor and uneducated they could not improve themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over time, however, a number of factors came together to catapult millions of Italian-Americans into the mainstream. They became mayors, governors, Cabinet members and federal judges. Is it just possible that Graglia might soften his views toward Hispanics against such a backdrop? Is it possible that he might consider that racism and other factors have played a disproportionate role in keeping blacks down?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was having lunch in Santa Monica, Calif., the other day after a panel discussion on immigration, race and education, when I heard an articulate person at my table say that bigots needed to be shown up for what they are, or else they may be taken seriously. There is some truth in that, but it also seems to me that people who can't identify a bigot on their own or who are prone to allege bigotry where none exists are nearly as dangerous as the bigot. That is precisely why the country is more in need of education through dialogue rather than exhortation, peroration or condemnation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of all people, President Clinton needs to be reminded that such a dialogue must take in a variety of points of view. But on issues of race, don't look for nuance from Clinton. ""Those kinds of remarks don't go down well with the president, period,"" said White House press secretary Mike McCurry in condemning Graglia's opinions out of hand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, Graglia hurt a lot of people's feelings in how he said what he said. In ignoring America's past and overlooking the redemptive promise this country has held out to groups that have triumphed over time after having started at the bottom, the truth about impoverished minorities and their potential has eluded him. Even so, he deserves tolerance from a society willing to engage in a complicated discussion where hurt feelings are inevitable.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports	
55524d56fdf99b0152c81fef	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1011079659.xml.txt	"<div><p>Conservative cliches</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like many of us who pontificate for a living, my column-writing colleague Jonah Goldberg apparently toils away in daily frustration that so many people fail to take his political advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would explain his new book, which takes on one of the world's least threatening problems, the political cliches that many people utter as a substitute for original thought.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is titled ""The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas."" With a title like that, need I bother to mention that the author is a conservative?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As such, he focuses on the cliches that trouble him most, and they happen to be those that he has heard uttered by liberals. That's sort of like reading Playboy for the articles; it's interesting, but something important is missing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do agree that some cliches like ""violence never settles anything"" need to go, at least until we find a good substitute for the word ""never."" In fact, history offers many examples of violence settling things, although not always in ways that were expected by its initiators. Vietnam, Iraq and the secession of the Confederacy come immediately to mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the more of Goldberg's book I read, the more appreciation I feel for the pithy power of the bumper-sticker truisms he ridicules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I like, for example, the old chestnut, ""Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer."" Goldberg responds, ""So you won't mind if those 10 guilty men move next door to you?"" Sure, but why blame the innocent guy for the 10 guilty guys next door? I would blame our criminal justice system for its failure to do what taxpayers pay them to do: Protect not only our lives and property but also our constitutional rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This barroom argument would not annoy me as much if there were not 289 exonerations of convicted individuals thanks to DNA evidence since 1989, according to the Innocence Project. The DNA era confirms some of our worst fears: We're getting the worst of both worlds; innocents are suffering while the guilty go free. And Goldberg gets to joke about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The author doesn't like ""Diversity is strength,"" either. (""Cool,"" he writes. ""The NBA should have a quota for midgets and one-legged point guards!"") Yet without getting into the deep weeds of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> debates, this country has prospered as a result of its mulligan stew of ethnics -- its Pages and Goldbergs, etc., etc. -- and our ability, more often than not, to work together with a sense of common purpose despite our differences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And surely Goldberg is not serious in his potshots at this old gem: ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Sure, he writes, ""if the other man is an idiot."" But, so what? An idiot can kill you just as dead as a sane man can. And even the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was viewed as a terrorist by those whose segregated way of life he set out to upset.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I would argue that one person's cliche is another person's wisdom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To illustrate and offer a bit of balance to what Goldberg has initiated, here are a few of the most annoying cliches, in my view, that I often hear from the political right:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""We don't solve problems by throwing money at them."" Sure. But you don't solve many problems by sucking money out of them either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Poor people need to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps."" Easier said than done, my friend. I tried to pull myself up by my own bootstraps and almost tumbled over on my head.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Keep the government's hands off of my Medicare."" Not easy. You'll have better luck with your bootstraps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Liberals love free speech as long as it supports the left."" Unlike conservatives, who love free speech as long as it does not come from the Quran or the Dixie Chicks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""America: Love It Or Leave It."" Funny, but I haven't heard that one much since President Barack Obama's election. Can we bring it back?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Why are all the news media slanted to the left -- except Fox News?"" Maybe Stephen Colbert got it right. He said, ""Reality has a liberal bias.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was a joke. It's not a cliche, yet.

55524d56fdf99b0152c81fef	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2832640273.xml.txt	"<div><p>Self-government is worth defending</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On this Independence Day, we should reaffirm the twin pillars of democracy: Voters (not the mob) pick their leaders, and elected leaders (not unelected judges) make policy decisions for which they are held accountable. Just as we need to preserve the sanctity of elections (by prosecuting coup instigators), democracy defenders need to address judicial radicals' gross distortion of our system, resulting in the current Supreme Court's subversion of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unhinged from judicial standards, the court now roves through the policy landscape, overturning decades of law and reordering Americans' lives and institutions. It upends women's health, revamps college admissions, snatches student aid from millions and redefines public accommodations (allowing egregious discrimination). In aggrandizing power, the court illegitimately dominates policymaking, undermining democracy to an extent we have not seen in nearly 100 years. (Ronald Brownstein pointed out that similar constitutional collisions in the 1850s and 1930s took a civil war or threat of court-packing to resolve.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something must change if we want to preserve rule by the people's elected leaders responsible to voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a preliminary matter, it is essential to identify the problem. As morally and politically offensive as Supreme Court decisions on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, LGBTQ+ discrimination and student debt forgiveness might be to millions of Americans, merely criticizing the court's result is misguided and unproductive. The task is to expose the court's disintegration as a legitimate judicial body and note its emergence as a supreme right-wing policymaker. When the court operates on an ends-justify-the-means basis, shreds legal doctrine and dishonestly presents the facts, critics should not play whack-a-mole, decrying each individual rejection of widespread American values. In doing so, the court negates self-government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telltale sign that the justices have become partisan politicians: their refusal to adopt mandatory ethics rules, which destroys the essence of judicial impartiality that is the root of their legitimacy. When judges cease to eliminate conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, they appear indistinguishable from politicians wined and dined in rarefied settings by lobbyists. The stench of financial corruption, coupled with justices' intemperate rants in partisan settings and in op-eds, convinces Americans that the justices are partisan players out to score points for their own side.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, the court strays out of its constitutional lane when it refuses to follow consistent rules of construction and honestly address cases' facts. When, for example, the majority casts aside stare decisis (as in the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> case) without admitting it or refuses to apply the test for departing from precedent (as in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization), it is simply muscling its way to desired outcomes because it has the votes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worse, cases are now manufactured to create policy. The majority has made complete hash out of standing and concepts such as ""case and controversy"" to reach decisions it had no business deciding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the student loan debt relief case, the court created standing out of whole cloth. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, ""The requirement that the proper party — the party actually affected — challenge an action ensures that courts do not overstep their proper bounds. … Without that requirement, courts become 'forums for the ventilation of public grievances' — for settlement of ideological and political disputes."" Here the court deliberately ignored that the aggrieved party was not a litigant. Likewise, in the case of a web designer worried about selling her services to a gay couple (who appear to be fabricated), the court defied every principle of standing. When the court goes beyond actual cases and controversies to answer hypotheticals, it goes beyond its constitutional mandate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, worst of all, the newfangled ""major questions doctrine"" allows the court to subjectively decide when the issue is of ""major political salience"" (whatever the court says it is); if so, the court demands the application at issue be specifically authorized by statute (a standard lawmakers somehow never meet in this court's eyes). It has become a crutch whenever the court seeks to invalidate a program it doesn't like. In the student debt relief case, the court reached the desired result by ignoring the word ""waive"" in the statute authorizing loan forgiveness to reach the finding that Congress hadn't delegated power to, well, waive student debt. ""[T]he Court once again substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch — and the hundreds of millions of people they represent — in making this Nation's most important, as well as most contested, policy decisions,"" Kagan wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mumbo-jumbo ""major questions doctrine"" is not the stuff of judging. No wonder the chief justice got touchy when Kagan pointed out that the court ""is supposed to stick to its business — to decide only cases and controversies and to stay away from making this Nation's policy about subjects like student-loan relief."" What the Slaughter-House Cases and substantive due process were to the New Deal-era right-wing court, the ""major questions doctrine"" is to the current court: a smokescreen for enforcing a right-wing agenda (or vetoing a progressive one).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In departing from the authentic judicial review, the right-wing majority unsurprisingly produces results perfectly aligned with the right's agenda on hot-button topics. (By the law of averages, its ""analysis"" should occasionally favor the other side.) When foretelling a case's outcome or following the majority's ""reasoning"" requires a crib sheet on GOP political aims, something is wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And voters have figured out what's going on. According to an ABC News-Ipsos poll, 53 percent ""believe that the nation's highest court rules mainly on the basis of their partisan political view rather than on the basis of the law (33%), while 14% say they don't know."" Before the Dobbs opinion, a separate January 2022 poll showed that ""38% of Americans believed that the justices rule mainly on the basis of law, versus 43% who believed that the court rules on the basis of their political views.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The transformation of the court into a partisan player contradicts the central premise of democracy. We should reject the obtuse and naive argument that this court isn't so bad because it didn't entirely obliterate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and declined to impose the outrageous independent state legislature doctrine. Now is no time for self-delusion. Ending the right-wing majority's intolerable war on self-government will require that the other two branches and the voters cut the court down to size. A single election or a single reform might not suffice. Cogent law review articles, informed public debate and exquisite dissents revealing that the right-wing judicial emperors have no clothes can assist reformers.

Martin Luther King Jr. almost 34 years ago, have been both a blessing and a curse. To many, they are a beacon still calling to the country. To others, they have indelibly tagged King as a hopeless utopian with lofty visions of ending war, racism and poverty, but with no concrete program to achieve these aims. No wonder the man we celebrate today has practically been turned into a harmless, badly outdated icon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he isn't. In a work largely ignored when it was published 30 years ago and all but unknown today, ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?,"" King turned from dreamer to problem solver. But before we look at those ideas, there are two huge caveats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, recasting the words of a historic figure to fit present situations must be avoided. This type of dangerous ideological revisionism was shamefully evident in the contentious debate over Proposition 209 in California. Both sides exploited and deliberately distorted the few stray remarks that King uttered on what is known today as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, a concept just beginning to take shape in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second caveat is that King can't be fitted into a neat ideological box. There is enough paradox and ambivalence in King's positions for liberals and conservatives to praise and damn. At various times, he railed against and embraced black militants. He applauded violent anti-colonial and national liberation movements and championed nonviolent change. Paradox and ambivalence also marked his private life. As a man of God, his moral lashing of America was wildly at odds with his questionable sexual conduct. Not surprisingly, King's solutions to many of the big-ticket racial and class problems that plagued America were a mix of idealism and pragmatism, which people faulted for lacking a clear direction. King can't be blamed for that. Three decades after his death, America is still no closer to solving these problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* The black family crisis. King branded the black family ""fragile, deprived and often psychopathic."" While he could have been criticized for giving weight to negative myths and stereotypes about black families, King was correct in targeting father absenteeism in the black home as a major ill. He made the standard liberal call for more government-funded job, education and skills training programs. But he also recognized the importance of values like training, discipline, hard work and the reduction of family violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Educational neglect. King did not believe that more funds, smaller classrooms and better textbooks alone would solve the crisis of the classroom. He called on teachers and administrators to rededicate themselves to the ideal of quality education, and for parents to get more involved in their children's education. King's proposal for ""educational parks,"" a kind of multifaceted complex for teaching basic skills as well as advanced studies, anticipated the idea of magnet schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Political apathy. Exercising the right to vote and electing blacks were not enough for King. He challenged black officeholders to be ""independent and assertive"" in fighting for legislation to improve the plight of the black poor and for black organizations to build political alliances with labor and other ethnic groups based on the needs and interests they have in common.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Corporate racism. The campaign against discrimination in hiring and promotions that followed the Texaco scandal closely followed a four-step plan outlined by King. It included more jobs and promotions, selected buying campaigns, boycotts and organized protests, negotiations and the monitoring of any agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Economic empowerment. King often quipped that it was futile to integrate a lunch counter if blacks couldn't afford to buy a meal. He demanded huge increases in federal funding for job and skills training programs. But he also recognized that government couldn't or shouldn't be expected to do it all. He called for ""black dollar days"" in which blacks purchased goods and services from black businesses and deposited their savings in black-owned banks. In turn, King expected black entrepreneurs to recycle those dollars into education, recreation and social programs for the black poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Crime and violence. King understood that the destructive cycle of drugs, crime and violence destabilized black communities. While his first priority was, as always, more government-funded job and education programs, he also stressed family values, personal responsibility and discipline. He urged black professionals to give more of their time and money to employment, educational and recreational programs aimed at ""saving"" at-risk black youth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Welfare. King agreed that reliance on welfare could breed dependency and discourage personal initiative. He proposed that the government provide direct tax subsidies and tax incentives to corporations to hire and train unskilled workers. This idea was a forerunner of today's federally backed enterprise and empowerment zones. He also called for the creation of ""second chance universities"" to train welfare recipients and the unemployed to compete in the technological job market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By today's standards, King's agenda may seem piecemeal and patchwork. Almost all of his ideas have been either implemented, tried and discarded or discredited. But so what? King didn't just dream of a new world, he died fighting for it. And in an era when politicians and community leaders believe that grabbing a photo-op or popping a sound-bite is leadership, King's vision and program still looks and sounds better than anything they offer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of ""Beyond O.J.: Race, Sex and Class in America.""

And America's. But what might an Obama victory mean for African-Americans in particular? Should we expect his administration to play a major role in black group advancement?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than a century, black civic leaders have tangled over whether to pursue economic independence or focus their energies on integrating political, corporate and educational institutions. W.E.B. Du Bois, author of the groundbreaking 1903 treatise, ""The Souls of Black Folk,"" argued for the latter, while his contemporary, Booker T. Washington, said ""political activity alone"" was not the answer. In addition, insisted Washington, ""you must have property, industry, skill, economy, intelligence and character.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the 1960s, the black civil-rights leadership has sided with Du Bois. Between 1970 and 2001, the number of black elected officials in the U.S. grew from fewer than 1,500 to more than 9,000. And while impressive socioeconomic progress has been made, wide black-white gaps remain in educational achievement, homeownership rates, labor-force participation, income levels and other measures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor should we conclude that civil-rights laws are responsible for the black progress that has occurred. For example, up until the 1950s, and in an era of open and rampant racial discrimination, the jobless rate for blacks was much lower than today and similar to that of whites in the same age group. In fact, blacks had higher labor-force participation rates than whites in every Census taken between 1890 and 1950. And in the decades preceding the 1960s -- that is, prior to the passage of landmark civil-rights bills and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> legislation -- there were sharp rises in black educational achievement, both absolutely and relative to whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economist Thomas Sowell has spent decades researching racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. and abroad. And his findings -- in books like ""Race and Culture: A World View,"" ""Affirmative Action Around the World"" and ""Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?"" -- show that political activity generally has not been a factor in the rise of groups from poverty to prosperity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Germans came to the U.S. as indentured servants during colonial times. And while working to pay off the cost of the voyage they studiously avoided participation in politics. Only after they'd risen economically did Germans begin seeking public office, culminating with the election of presidents Hoover and Eisenhower.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern can be found among Chinese populations in southeast Asia, the Caribbean and the U.S. In Argentina, where English minorities have done well financially and played a major role in the development of the economy, they've played almost no role in Argentine politics. And so it goes with Italians in the the U.S. and Jews in Britain: In both places economic gains have generally preceded political gains. ""Empirically, political activity and political success have been neither necessary nor sufficient for economic advancement,"" writes Mr. Sowell. ""Nor has eager political participation or outstanding success in politics translated into faster group achievement.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans might keep in mind that in those rare instances where the political success of a minority group has come first, it has often resulted in slower socioeconomic progress. The Irish immigrants who came to the U.S. in the mid-19th century hailed from a country where 80% of the population was rural. Yet they settled in industrial centers like New York, Philadelphia and Boston and took low-skill jobs. Their rise from poverty was especially slow -- as late as 1920, 80% of all Irish women working in America were domestic servants -- despite the fact that Irish-run political organizations dominated many big-city governments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The Irish were fiercely loyal to each other, electing, appointing and promoting their own kind,"" writes Mr. Sowell. ""This had little effect on the average Irish American, who began to reach economic prosperity in the 20th century at about the same time when the Irish political machines began to decline.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If elected, Mr. Obama may well turn out to be a competent president, even an admirable one. But history gives us no indication that his political success will translate into black upward mobility. And given Mr. Obama's liberal leanings, there's every reason to believe that current obstacles to black progress will remain in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The candidate favors minimum-wage laws, for example, on the assumption that they help lift people out of poverty. But most poor people already earn more than the minimum wage. And most people who earn the minimum wage aren't poor. Minimum-wage laws are more likely to price people out of the labor market, especially younger and less educated workers, a large number of whom happen to be black. Today's economy places a premium on skills. If young people can't get an entry-level job because an artificial federal wage floor has made them too expensive to hire, they can't gain the skills and experience to move up the economic ladder.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take another example: Mr. Obama opposes educational choice, which will also have a negative impact on poor blacks, who tend to be the ones stuck in America's worst public schools. Mr. Obama opposes school vouchers that would allow low-income black parents to send their children to the type of private school where he sends his own daughters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both cases, the only ""change"" that Mr. Obama would be bringing the Oval Office is the color of the person perpetrating bad policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Riley is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes
65a59414270861aa7db6520c	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1023015447.xml.txt	"<div><p>Main Street: Chief Justice Roberts Taxes Credibility</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not once in the 59 pages that constitute Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts's lead opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius does he use the word ""integrity."" Even so, in the days since the individual mandate was upheld as a tax, concern for the ""integrity"" or ""legitimacy"" or ""reputation"" of the Roberts Court has become the most accepted explanation for why the chief justice ruled as he did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus Reuters, which tells us that Justice Roberts was ""trying to preserve the integrity of the judiciary in polarized Washington."" Or the New York Times, where Tom Friedman lauds the chief justice for ""a simple noble leadership impulse at a critical juncture in our history -- to preserve the legitimacy of the Supreme Court."" The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer agrees with this motivation, speculating that had Justice Roberts ""been just an associate justice, and not the chief"" he might well have voted otherwise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Krauthammer is correct, it raises a disquieting question. During Justice Roberts's confirmation hearings back in 2005, he described judges as umpires whose job it is to call balls and strikes as he sees them. The idea that he might have voted otherwise if he were not chief justice suggests that a ""strike"" was changed to a ""ball"" because of concerns for how the straight call would be perceived.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let us stipulate that there's nothing wrong with a justice who starts out with one opinion but changes his mind as he reviews the facts and arguments. Let us agree too that the reputation of the court is a legitimate concern of any justice. The fundamental difficulty remains: a labored lead opinion that looks like a conclusion struggling for a rationale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unless Justice Roberts tells us, we will never know for sure. Still, the circumstantial evidence is persuasive. For one thing, against the contrivance of the lead opinion there is the clarity of a united dissent that we now understand started out as a majority view with Justice Roberts's support. That clarity likewise characterizes two separate decisions by conservative federal appellate judges -- Laurence Silberman and Jeffrey Sutton -- who upheld the individual mandate as a penalty under the Commerce Clause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also hard not to notice that people now extolling Justice Roberts for rescuing the court's integrity are largely the same ones who have been impugning it. That's especially true of the White House, which had made plain that if the Supreme Court had gone the other way on health care, the Roberts Court would become a major target of Obama's re-election campaign. The chief justice knows how ugly that might be, having sat through the president's crass political attack on his court during the 2010 State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As more than one conservative has pointed out, the integrity of liberal justices who reliably line up for whatever outcome is desired by the Democratic Party goes unquestioned. Indeed, the definition of integrity assumes one direction. For example, the one notable occasion when the Supreme Court specifically invoked integrity was back in 1992 (Planned Parenthood v. Casey), when the court used it to justify reaffirming Roe v. Wade's conclusion -- a constitutional right to abortion -- while rejecting the reasoning that led to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, in that case the court was deferring to a previous judicial power grab and not to the people acting through their elected representatives. Still, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's clarifying rebuke is well worth reprising here: ""Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perception -- a job not for lawyers but for political campaign managers -- the Justices should do what is legally right.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia's dissent in Casey illuminates a political handicap imposed on conservatives by their own principles. Whereas the liberal belief in a living Constitution allows them to stretch its limits to justify almost any desired outcome, conservatives believe the Constitution imposes real limits. The chief justice's tax argument rankles because no one else in America is buying it: certainly not the conservative dissenters, who firmly reject it, nor the court liberals, who appear to have winked because it gave them the outcome they wanted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The day after the ruling came down, this newspaper carried an article that explained Justice Roberts's decision this way: ""By confounding charges that the court is too partisan, the chief justice might have earned sufficient political capital to move to the right during the next term, when the court will likely confront a host of hot-button issues, including <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage and the continued vitality of the Voting Rights Act.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If earning ""sufficient political capital"" is simply a consequence of his ruling, Justice Roberts cannot be blamed. If it was the aim, however, and it led to his voting as chief justice in a way he would not have voted as an associate justice, he has raised rather than resolved questions about the integrity of the Roberts court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

But given the tenor of the Court's recent decisions on racial preferences, the Administration has made a smart strategic move to preserve what can and should be saved of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case concerns the decision of the Piscataway, N.J., school board to promote racial diversity by laying off a white teacher so that it could preserve the job of an equally qualified black teacher. Though the Administration had previously supported the school board, the brief it filed with the Supreme Court on Aug. 23 concedes that the board violated the civil rights of the white teacher.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In previous rulings, the Court has maintained that government use of racial preferences is constitutional only when such action is necessary to remedy a history of overt discrimination, or when the public goal being pursued is ''compelling.'' Moreover, the Court has said, the use of racial preferences must be ''narrowly tailored'' to meet the particular goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appellate court that heard the Piscataway case declared, in effect, that racial diversity could never be a compelling state interest. Should the Supreme Court completely uphold the appellate court's ruling, the use of race in decisions about hiring and firing public employees could, for all practical purposes, be prohibited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Piscataway case, the avowed goal -- racial diversity within a single, small department of an otherwise diverse faculty -- does not seem ''compelling.'' And the way the school board chose to pursue its goal of diversity -- dismissing a white teacher solely because of her race -- was not ''narrowly tailored.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By acknowledging this, yet at the same time making a broader argument for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, the Administration hopes to preserve some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring. The approach it has suggested in its brief is essentially a compromise. Even if the Piscataway school board was wrong in this specific instance in its use of racial preference, the Administration argues, there is still a place for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and not only to remedy past discrimination. Indeed, as it points out in its brief, there are times when taking race into account is the only way to further compelling public goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A police department, for example, may need to recruit a diverse officer corps to carry on effective undercover work or to retain public confidence in neighborhoods where there are racial tensions. At schools and colleges, a diverse faculty may, through the example of its own collegiality, teach students important lessons about working across racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the absolutist opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have the upper hand, in the courts as well as in the broader public debate. California now outlaws the use of race in public hiring, contracting and education. And in a case challenging <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> at the University of Texas Law School, a Federal appeals court ruled last year that racial diversity in a student body could never constitute a compelling state interest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court declined to review that decision, but in taking on the Piscataway case, the Court has the opportunity to clarify the question of when, if ever, it is legitimate to use <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> to achieve racial diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a grave error for the Court to adopt an absolutist color-blind view on the question of whether race should ever be a factor in decisions about public employment. Moreover, it is impossible to maintain such absolutism and still uphold a commitment to prevent racial discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider efforts to recruit job applicants that are directed toward minority candidates -- as when companies send recruiters to heavily black schools when blacks are underrepresented in their work force. Such efforts would clearly violate the color-blind principle. Even when the final hiring decision is made solely on the basis of an applicant's qualifications, without regard to race, these recruitment programs involve discrimination because they bestow the benefits of better job information and a greater number of alternative job offers on some individuals solely because of their race. Yet these programs are widespread in both the public and the private sectors, and they are needed to prevent discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to public employment, the Administration makes a strong case for considering race. Indeed, its argument could also be applied to the lifetime appointments to the Federal courts that interpret the constitutionality of race-based state action. The legitimacy of court rulings in this area would surely be undermined by the absence from the bench of nonwhite members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't mean that racial quotas should be used for judicial appointments. But as far as the Federal judiciary is concerned, there is a compelling public interest in racial diversity for its own sake. Perhaps the Justices who decide the Piscataway case will have the wisdom to see this point.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

The top two were the University of California system and Harvard, both of which gave about 19 times more money to John Kerry than to George W. Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at Berkeley, denies that academic institutions are biased against conservatives. The disparity in hiring, he explains, occurs because conservatives are not as interested as liberals in academic careers. Why does he think liberals are like that? ""Unlike conservatives, they believe in working for the public good and social justice."" That clears that up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A filtering process, from graduate school admissions through tenure decisions, tends to exclude conservatives from what Mark Bauerlein calls academia's ""sheltered habitat."" In a dazzling essay in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Bauerlein, professor of English at Emory University and director of research and analysis at the National Endowment for the Arts, notes that the ""first protocol"" of academic society is the ""common assumption"" -- that, at professional gatherings, all the strangers in the room are liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a reasonable assumption, given that in order to enter the profession, your work must be deemed, by the criteria of the prevailing culture, ""relevant."" Bauerlein says that various academic fields now have regnant premises that embed political orientations in their very definitions of scholarship:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Schools of education, for instance, take constructivist theories of learning as definitive, excluding realists (in matters of knowledge) on principle, while the quasi-Marxist outlook of cultural studies rules out those who espouse capitalism. If you disapprove of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, forget pursuing a degree in African-American studies. If you think that the nuclear family proves the best unit of social well-being, stay away from women's studies.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This gives rise to what Bauerlein calls the ""false consensus effect,"" which occurs when, because of institutional provincialism, ""people think that the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population."" There also is what Cass Sunstein, professor of political science and jurisprudence at the University of Chicago, calls ""the law of group polarization."" Bauerlein explains: ""When like-minded people deliberate as an organized group, the general opinion shifts toward extreme versions of their common beliefs."" They become tone-deaf to the way they sound to others outside their closed circle of belief.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When John Kennedy brought to Washington such academics as Arthur Schlesinger Jr., John Kenneth Galbraith, McGeorge and William Bundy and Walt Rostow, it was said that the Charles River was flowing into the Potomac. Actually, Richard Nixon's administration had an even more distinguished academic cast -- Henry Kissinger, Pat Moynihan, Arthur Burns, James Schlesinger and others.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Academics such as the next secretary of state still decorate Washington, but academia is less listened to than it was.

One consequence of that power play is that Democratic senators are under extreme pressure from their liberal base to oppose Gorsuch. Beyond that, they have legitimate concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, from gay and transgender rights to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and reproductive rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are free to remind their Republican colleagues -- and Gorsuch -- of the injustice done to Obama and Garland. They also have every right to question the nominee about his rulings on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and his previous work, such as the role he played as a Justice Department lawyer in defending the George W. Bush administration's policies on interrogating and detaining suspected terrorists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the main focus should be how Gorsuch would approach the role of a Supreme Court justice. Gorsuch is only 49; if confirmed, he could sit on the court for decades and outlast several presidents and Congresses. In particular, they should explore how Gorsuch would interpret the Constitution and, to a lesser extent, acts of Congress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like Scalia, Gorsuch has been described as an ""originalist,"" someone who interprets the Constitution according to the meaning its provisions had at the time they were adopted. In a speech at Case Western Reserve University Law School last year, Gorsuch said judges should strive to ""apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This formula is much less straightforward than it seems. For one thing, ""text"" and ""history"" can be at odds because language can have different connotations at different times. For example, to Americans in the 19th century, the ""equal protection of the laws"" guaranteed by the 14th Amendment might seem to protect only racial equality; in the 20th century it seemed obvious to many Americans that it also prohibited some forms of sexual discrimination. Does Gorsuch object to that updated interpretation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he believe that a constitutional provision must be viewed through the eyes of the generation in which it was adopted and can't be interpreted to deal with situations its authors couldn't have imagined, such as cellphone signals being used to track suspects without a warrant? The U.S. Constitution has never been that sort of rigid document.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scalia, for whom Gorsuch has expressed great admiration, was zealous in defending relatively specific rights mentioned in the Constitution, including freedom of speech and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures -- even in circumstances that the Constitution's framers couldn't have anticipated, such as the sale of video games or the use by police of GPS technology. But Scalia's version of originalism led to him dissent stridently from rulings recognizing rights, such as abortion or marriage equality for gays and lesbians, that his colleagues rightly read into more general language in the Constitution about ""liberty"" and ""equal protection of the laws.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those decisions were a natural outgrowth of earlier rulings in which the court secured other rights that the Constitution didn't explicitly guarantee, such as a right to marry someone of another race (or the right to marry at all) or the right to use contraceptives in the privacy of one's bedroom. An America in which those decisions had come out the other way would not be an America in which most of us would want to live.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators should ask Gorsuch whether he shares Scalia's disdain for the court's decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage and, if so, whether he would nevertheless accord those decisions respect as precedents of the court. It's entirely possible that Gorsuch would not have joined the decisions legalizing abortion or same-sex marriage but also wouldn't agitate to overturn those rulings if he joined the court. Gorsuch reportedly told Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that he didn't believe a long-established precedent should be overruled simply because five current justices think it was wrongly decided. That's a possibility the committee should look into, but as part of a broader inquiry into Gorsuch's view of the importance of precedent and predictability in the law. (Some precedents, after all, should be overturned -- witness Plessy vs. Ferguson, the 1896 ruling that approved segregation in public facilities.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if Gorsuch wouldn't upset existing precedents, he could make it harder for the court to adapt to future changes in American society if he took too constrained an ""originalist"" approach going forward. That's why it's important that senators engage him in a dialogue about his view of the court's role that goes beyond hot-button issues such as abortion, guns and gay rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gorsuch is obviously an accomplished jurist. He has been rated ""well qualified"" by the American Bar Assn. (as was Garland, who never was permitted to appear before the Judiciary Committee). Unlike some Trump appointees, he is neither a crony nor someone whose professional credentials can be questioned. But the Senate has a right to look beyond a sterling resume to inquire about the philosophy that will help shape the court for decades to come.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

The lessons here are instructive. The ballot measure claimed to end “preferential treatment” in state schools. It resulted in a 25% reduction in Black student enrollment at state colleges and universities — the largest decline among all groups. Two decades later, UC’s Black enrollment is about 5%; it was slightly more than 7% pre-Prop. 209.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the executive director of Black College Success — a community-based nonprofit that provides academic pathways to colleges and universities for hundreds of Black students in South Los Angeles — I’m forced to reckon with the difficulty of improving such statistics. You should know that 75% of Black students from the Los Angeles Unified School District don’t enroll in and 85% don’t graduate from a four-year college or university. They come from communities where the median family income is less than $48,000 a year, and where less than 10% of community members have a college degree.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite these terrible odds, in May, the Black College Success team celebrated the admission of 208 students to more than 40 colleges and universities, including prestigious institutions such as Stanford, Pepperdine, Pitzer, Tulane and New York University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was far from easy for these students. For instance, Jackson, 18 and headed to a competitive school in the northeast, grew up in a single-parent household with a hardworking father who drives for Amazon, faced the challenges of being a Black man in L.A., avoiding gang life and supporting his siblings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ajaa, 17, will be a freshman at an HBCU — a historically Black college or university — in Georgia. She won more than $100,000 in scholarships while working part time to support her family, including take care of her younger brother so that her mother could attend school too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We’re not only trying to shatter the boundaries Black students from South Los Angeles face in gaining access to college, but to also help make clear the transformative opportunity that college offers their families financially for the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the students we work with will be the first in their families to go to college. And our help doesn’t stop there. To get them to graduation (our first cohort hasn’t yet reached that milestone), we follow them wherever they enroll, with continued counseling about class choices and majors and career possibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, how do we do it? And how will we do it in a post-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> world?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There’s just one way: one student at a time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the work of finding and recruiting high schoolers for the program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning as early as sophomore year (as we continue to expand, we’ll eventually work with students starting the moment they enter high school), a team of “college access managers,” who are from the same neighborhoods as our students and have backgrounds in college recruitment, go into our partner high schools, which have expressed an interest in working with us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The managers figuratively and literally meet the students where they are and offer them an array of supports, starting with academic planning assistance for their A-G requirements, the classes students must complete with a grade of C or better to be eligible to enter the Cal State or UC systems. No matter where students apply, the A-G standards are an objective demonstration that they’re college ready.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At times, the students’ need for mentoring is far greater than our capacity, so we partner with in-school resources, such as the newly created Black Student Achievement Program, and lock arms with other nonprofits like Brotherhood Crusade, 826LA, Los Angeles Urban League and others that can help us provide writing workshops, access to advanced courses and a range of extracurricular activities, stipends for summer internships, career guidance and scholarships.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once our students become seniors, they receive one-on-one college application assistance, personal statement workshops and financial aid advice. We take them on college and university visits and help them evaluate their choices. Our aim is to provide them with everything they need to level the landscape against peers who often enjoy significant advantages, such as private tutors and schools with more funding and resources than those in South L.A.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In doing this work, I’ve learned that it’s not how high a student’s GPA is or how impressive their test scores are that gets results. It’s an all-of-the-above mix of academics, guidance and the students’ own determination — the ability of a Jackson or an Ajaa to persevere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I’ve seen stories like theirs by the dozens. My fear is that, in the unfortunate new world of colorblind admissions, the opportunities available to them will diminish. If colleges and universities look past the distinctive experiences of Black applicants, it’s not just the students who will lose, but society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ibert Schultz is the executive director of Black College Success, a project of the LA Promise Fund.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>	stance:::Neutral

It's way past time for him to accept the fact that there's a new wunderkind in town.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as Bill Clinton looks at Obama and sees his own oblivion, so does Jesse Jackson. As Shelby Steele wrote in The Wall Street Journal, Jackson and his generation of civil rights leaders ""made keeping whites 'on the hook' the most sacred article of the post-'60s black identity,"" equality pursued by manipulating white guilt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now John McCain is pea-green with envy. That's the only explanation for why a man who prides himself on honor, a man who vowed not to take the low road in the campaign, having been mugged by W. and Rove in South Carolina in 2000, is engaging in a festival of juvenilia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Arizona senator who built his reputation on being a brave proponent of big solutions is running a schoolyard campaign about tire gauges and Paris Hilton, childishly accusing his opponent of being too serious, too popular and not patriotic enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even his own mother, the magical 96-year-old Roberta McCain, let slip that she thought the Paris Hilton-Britney Spears ad was ""kinda stupid.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain's 2000 strategist, John Weaver, was equally blunt with Newsweek's Jonathan Alter: ""It's hard to imagine America responding to 'small ball' when we have all these problems.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of McCain's old pals in the Senate are cringing at what they see as his soulless transformation into what he once scorned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""John's eaten up with envy,"" said one. ""His image of himself was always the handsome, celebrity flyboy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Now somebody else is the celebrity,"" the colleague continued, while John looks in the mirror and sees his face marred by skin cancer and looks at the TV and sees his dashing self-image replaced by visions of William Frawley, with Letterman jokes about his membership in the ham radio club and adventures with wagon trains.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For McCain, being cool meant being a rogue, not a policy wonk; but Obama manages to be a cool College Bowl type, which must irk McCain, who liked to play up his bad-boy cool. Now the guy in the back of the class is shooting spitballs at the class pet and is coming off as more juvenile than daring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Around the McCain campaign, they grouse that Obama ""hasn't bled."" He hasn't bled literally, in military service, just like W., the last holder of an E-ZPass who sped past McCain. And he hasn't paid his dues in the Senate, since he basically just stopped by for directions to the Oval Office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a new senator, Obama was not only precocious enough to pounce on turf that McCain had invested years in, such as campaign finance lobbying, ethics reform and earmarks. When Obama did reach across the aisle for a mentor, it was to the staid Richard Lugar of Indiana, not to the salty Republican of choice for Democrats, McCain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the Illinois freshman took back a private promise to join McCain's campaign finance reform effort, McCain told his aide Mark Salter to ""brush him back."" Salter sent an over-the-top vituperative letter to Obama. ""I guess I beaned him instead,"" Salter told Newsweek's Howard Fineman.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain could dismiss W. as a lightweight, but he knows Obama's smart. Obama wrote his own books, while McCain's were written by Salter. McCain knows he's the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> scion of admirals who might not have gotten through Annapolis without being a legacy. Obama didn't even tell Harvard Law School that he was black on his application.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain upbraids Obama for being a poppet, while he's becoming a puppet. His mouth is moving but the words coming out belong to his new hard-boiled strategist, Steve Schmidt, a Rove protege, nicknamed ""The Bullet"" for his bald pate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Schmidt has turned Mr. Straight Talk into Mr. Desperate Straits.

65a59414270861aa7db6520c	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421118533.xml.txt	"<div><p>PERSPECTIVE ON MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.; A Visionary With More Than a Dream; Today's fuzzy icon had many practical ideas for improving the lot of blacks, some now taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The four words, ""I have a dream,"" seared into the nation's consciousness by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. almost 34 years ago, have been both a blessing and a curse. To many, they are a beacon still calling to the country. To others, they have indelibly tagged King as a hopeless utopian with lofty visions of ending war, racism and poverty, but with no concrete program to achieve these aims. No wonder the man we celebrate today has practically been turned into a harmless, badly outdated icon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he isn't. In a work largely ignored when it was published 30 years ago and all but unknown today, ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?,"" King turned from dreamer to problem solver. But before we look at those ideas, there are two huge caveats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, recasting the words of a historic figure to fit present situations must be avoided. This type of dangerous ideological revisionism was shamefully evident in the contentious debate over Proposition 209 in California. Both sides exploited and deliberately distorted the few stray remarks that King uttered on what is known today as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, a concept just beginning to take shape in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second caveat is that King can't be fitted into a neat ideological box. There is enough paradox and ambivalence in King's positions for liberals and conservatives to praise and damn. At various times, he railed against and embraced black militants. He applauded violent anti-colonial and national liberation movements and championed nonviolent change. Paradox and ambivalence also marked his private life. As a man of God, his moral lashing of America was wildly at odds with his questionable sexual conduct. Not surprisingly, King's solutions to many of the big-ticket racial and class problems that plagued America were a mix of idealism and pragmatism, which people faulted for lacking a clear direction. King can't be blamed for that. Three decades after his death, America is still no closer to solving these problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* The black family crisis. King branded the black family ""fragile, deprived and often psychopathic."" While he could have been criticized for giving weight to negative myths and stereotypes about black families, King was correct in targeting father absenteeism in the black home as a major ill. He made the standard liberal call for more government-funded job, education and skills training programs. But he also recognized the importance of values like training, discipline, hard work and the reduction of family violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Educational neglect. King did not believe that more funds, smaller classrooms and better textbooks alone would solve the crisis of the classroom. He called on teachers and administrators to rededicate themselves to the ideal of quality education, and for parents to get more involved in their children's education. King's proposal for ""educational parks,"" a kind of multifaceted complex for teaching basic skills as well as advanced studies, anticipated the idea of magnet schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Political apathy. Exercising the right to vote and electing blacks were not enough for King. He challenged black officeholders to be ""independent and assertive"" in fighting for legislation to improve the plight of the black poor and for black organizations to build political alliances with labor and other ethnic groups based on the needs and interests they have in common.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Corporate racism. The campaign against discrimination in hiring and promotions that followed the Texaco scandal closely followed a four-step plan outlined by King. It included more jobs and promotions, selected buying campaigns, boycotts and organized protests, negotiations and the monitoring of any agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Economic empowerment. King often quipped that it was futile to integrate a lunch counter if blacks couldn't afford to buy a meal. He demanded huge increases in federal funding for job and skills training programs. But he also recognized that government couldn't or shouldn't be expected to do it all. He called for ""black dollar days"" in which blacks purchased goods and services from black businesses and deposited their savings in black-owned banks. In turn, King expected black entrepreneurs to recycle those dollars into education, recreation and social programs for the black poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Crime and violence. King understood that the destructive cycle of drugs, crime and violence destabilized black communities. While his first priority was, as always, more government-funded job and education programs, he also stressed family values, personal responsibility and discipline. He urged black professionals to give more of their time and money to employment, educational and recreational programs aimed at ""saving"" at-risk black youth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Welfare. King agreed that reliance on welfare could breed dependency and discourage personal initiative. He proposed that the government provide direct tax subsidies and tax incentives to corporations to hire and train unskilled workers. This idea was a forerunner of today's federally backed enterprise and empowerment zones. He also called for the creation of ""second chance universities"" to train welfare recipients and the unemployed to compete in the technological job market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By today's standards, King's agenda may seem piecemeal and patchwork. Almost all of his ideas have been either implemented, tried and discarded or discredited. But so what? King didn't just dream of a new world, he died fighting for it. And in an era when politicians and community leaders believe that grabbing a photo-op or popping a sound-bite is leadership, King's vision and program still looks and sounds better than anything they offer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of ""Beyond O.J.: Race, Sex and Class in America.""

RIGHT AT THE POLLS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Internet has made it easier than ever to find information, buy books, communicate with people all over the world, and goof off at work. Now it promises to simplify a dreary task that looms before us this year: choosing a president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No, it does not provide the sort of ""help"" offered by glad- handing office-seekers who are eager to enumerate their heroic virtues and inspiring achievements--and to mournfully recite the many ways in which every single one of their opponents falls short. Between now and November, we will have plenty of middle-age men in blue suits doing their utmost to talk us into making a decision congenial to their interests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you would prefer to make a decision congenial to your interests, you can consult a couple of Web sites that serve the function for politics that the personal ads serve for romance: matching compatible partners. They give you questionnaires asking your views on various national issues, tabulate your answers, and tell you with whom you are most likely to find long-term happiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of these is selectsmart.com, where the range of choices goes from Pat Buchanan to Ralph Nader, though it also includes all the sane people in the race. Candidates you have probably never heard of before, such as David McReynolds and Howard Phillips, are there, and the site provides sufficient candidate information to explain why you have never heard of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The questionnaire asks about abortion, crime, defense, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, education, taxes, foreign policy, and the like. I filled it out and was presented with a list of how my views compared with those of the candidates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the top of my list was Harry Browne, a Libertarian Party candidate who scored 89 on a scale of 100. No argument there: I voted for Browne in 1996, and I may do so again, more to express my general outlook on policy than because I really want his finger on the nuclear button. Tied for second were Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch (61), followed by George W. Bush and Steve Forbes, both at 53.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Equally interesting was finding out who would be most likely to cause me to emigrate to Canada should he ever get to the Oval Office. Moving down the list, I learned that I should vote for Donald Trump over Bill Bradley, and that my views would be better represented in the White House by David McReynolds, a Socialist, than by Al Gore. Only Warren Beatty, it seems, is further from my thinking than the vice president. Somehow, this last revelation did not come as a surprise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over at presidentmatch.com, the options are limited to candidates of the two major parties, and after I answered the quiz, I was informed that Alan Keyes and I were made for each other. Next was Steve Forbes, followed by George Bush. Coming in last, the blind date from hell, was none other than Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The main disagreement between the two sites was over the other candidates: selectsmart ranked John McCain better for me than Bill Bradley, while presidentmatch said I should run screaming from McCain, unless the only other option is the guy who invented the Internet. So if the contest comes down to Bradley and McCain, I'll have to flip a coin. Or shoot myself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is all useful information, but it falls short of making the choice as easy as filling out the options you want on a new car, and it could be misleading for anyone who takes it too seriously. The matchmakers pay little attention to some important issues, like the federal budget, missile defense, letting China into the World Trade Organization, and the use of metal bats in baseball (Bush, bless him, would allow wood only).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matters like experience in office get little weight, which makes Forbes and Browne look better than they really are. Temperament and political skills, in which Bush and Bradley might contrast favorably with Gary Bauer or Orrin Hatch, are not considered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason Alan Keyes and I are classified as compatible is that neither President Match nor Select Smart gave me the chance to express my reluctance to vote for someone who appears to be out of his mind. Select Smart put Pat Buchanan in the middle of the pack for me, even though I would sooner pinch Mike Tyson on the bottom than vote for a raving anti-Semite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's something to be said for forcing yourself to contemplate which policies you favor--and for finding out whether the candidate you are drawn to for one reason or another is actually one who would head in the direction you want to go. By focusing on issues of substance, the quizzes are a good antidote to McCain's biography, Bradley's NBA career, Bush's rakish grin, and Gore's . . . well, Gore is probably his own antidote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So if you want to make an intelligent choice in this election, you could do worse than to answer one of these questionnaires. And if you end up voting for Harry Browne, don't blame me.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

To avoid charges of partisanship, let an independent third party put titles and summaries on initiatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Words matter. And when those words appear on the ballot, where space is limited and the competition for voter attention is high, they matter a lot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This has become an issue for a group of Republicans who have proposed a ballot initiative to repeal a recently passed package of gas taxes and vehicle fees. On Friday, they sued California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, claiming his office put a partisan spin on the title it gave their initiative. Instead of describing the initiative in a straightforward way, saying something like ""Repeals the gas tax,"" the title says instead: ""Eliminates recently enacted road repair and transportation funding by repealing revenues dedicated for those purposes. ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The description is accurate, as far as it goes. And even though the words ""taxes"" and ""fees"" don't appear in the title, they do appear in the summary that goes directly after the title on the signature petitions and on the ballot, if it qualifies. Anyone taking the time to read through the petition before signing it would figure out what the measure was all about.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the title is clunky and manages to avoid the simple and direct words that would clarify what the initiative actually does. Worse yet, the initiative's proponents believe that the language was made intentionally opaque to weaken the measure's support.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ballot proponents do not get to dictate the titles that go with their proposals, but there was no reason this title had to be so tortured. Does that mean the word choice was politically motivated? Not necessarily. It could merely be the result of having been written by lawyers. Ultimately, it will be up to a judge to decide whether Becerra should rewrite the title and summary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But such complaints are unnecessarily common in situations where an attorney general from one party prepares the language for a ballot initiative pushed by people in the other party. State law gives the attorney general the responsibility of writing ""true and impartial"" titles and summaries without creating ""prejudice, for or against the proposed measure."" Nevertheless, more than a couple of attorneys general have been accused of choosing -- or omitting -- words for the ballot title or summary to make a political point or to sway voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, former Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, a Republican, was sued for his decision not to include the hot button words ""<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>"" in the summary of Proposition 209, the controversial 1996 ballot measure that ended state <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs. Former Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat, was accused of bias when she wrote the summary for a pension reform proposal. Jerry Brown, when he served as attorney general, was criticized for the language he used to describe Proposition 8, the same-sex marriage initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a pretty simple solution: Give the duty to a nonpartisan third party. This idea has cropped up periodically in recent years, but hasn't gone anywhere. The most recent proposal, by Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Roseville), would reassign the writing of ballot titles and summaries to the Legislative Analyst's Office. The proposal (which would itself be in the form of a ballot initiative) was supported by California Common Cause and the League of Women Voters of California. But it was opposed by Becerra and died in its first committee hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kiley's bill may be dead, but this is an idea that ought to be given serious consideration by both parties. The LAO has done an admirable job of writing clear, concise and apolitical analyses of proposed legislation. It stands to reason the LAO would produce ballot titles and summaries with the same non-partisan balance and clarity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's bad enough that the titles of ballot measures are often vague and unhelpful. (Just consider two competing measures on the November statewide ballot: Proposition 62, titled simply ""Death Penalty,"" and Proposition 66, with the title ""Death Penalty. Procedures."" Only when voters read the summary did it become clear that one measure proposed ending the death penalty in California and the other proposed speeding it up.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters shouldn't have to wonder also if those titles are a product of political spin.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

That he's ""not qualified."" That the only reason he was appointed is because he's black. In other words, that he's a product of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> or, more precisely, an ""<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, for instance, liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote: ""I believe in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, but I have to acknowledge there are arguments against it. One of the more cogent is the presence of Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Robinson's comment echoes many previous attacks. In 2000, for example, Newsweek columnist Anna Quindlen -- another liberal who has written in support of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> -- declared that Thomas' ""judicial resume was mediocre; he was chosen because he was conservative and black, an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire by an administration that eschewed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many liberal Democrats aren't willing to say out loud what Robinson and Quindlen wrote so clearly. After all, they're conditioned to defend racial preferences, which they insist do not promote ""incompetent"" or ""unqualified"" people. But that doesn't mean they don't think it. Even The American Prospect magazine, a liberal journal that sees its mission as ""beating back the right wing,"" ran an article two years ago calling Thomas the ""most visible <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land, a token black nominee whose lack of qualifications was so painfully outed during his confirmation hearings.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How can you support a policy of racial preferences and then attack one of its supposed beneficiaries as undeserving? This, ultimately, is the intrinsic hypocrisy of the Thomas bashers. They allege that he's not competent and that the only reason he became a Supreme Court justice was because he's black. And in so doing, they level the exact same arguments against Thomas that they castigate conservatives for making about <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> itself. But let's face facts: A program that gives people with a certain skin color an advantage will invariably reward some who would otherwise not qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This blatant intellectual inconsistency does not stop Thomas' liberal critics from accusing him of hypocrisy -- namely, for being the ""most visible <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land"" while simultaneously standing as its most prominent black opponent. By opposing racial preferences, liberals say, Thomas -- who was accepted into Yale Law School via an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program -- is denying others the very same benefits he received.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Thomas reveals in ""My Grandfather's Son,"" his opposition to racial preferences is based on personal conscience and a genuine concern for its effects on black Americans, not selfish disregard for his racial brethren born out of self-loathing, as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> advocates would have it. He writes that he keeps his Yale diploma tucked away in his basement with a 15-cent cigar sticker affixed to its frame. Why? In a ""60 Minutes"" interview, Thomas said ""that degree meant one thing for whites and another thing for blacks. . . . It was discounted.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is one of the tragic legacies of racial preferences -- that the achievements of black people in the professional world will always be suspect, and not just to blacks who benefit from such preferences. In the minds even of liberals, blacks will always be thought of as ""<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hires"" no matter how bright or qualified they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may be difficult for well-intentioned white liberals to understand the personal insecurity that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> causes, and as a white person, I can only take someone like Thomas at his word when he writes about the shame he feels because of racial preferences. But as a gay man, I can certainly empathize, as I imagine I would feel exactly the same way if sexual orientation became a ""plus factor"" in a law school or employment application process. Factoring in a person's immutable traits demeans them and robs them of their individuality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether or not Thomas is qualified to be a Supreme Court justice, who are <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> advocates to smear him as an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire? (Can you imagine a left-wing magazine like The American Prospect saying that about a liberal black judge? It would never happen.) But if they honestly believe Thomas is one, then they only have themselves to blame for a rotten system that privileges some people over others because of skin pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the day his Supreme Court nomination was announced by President George H.W. Bush, Thomas' critics have personally and viciously attacked him as if he were an abstraction -- representing everything they hate about minorities (whether women, gays or blacks) who do not subscribe to their liberal nostrums -- and, in so doing, have sucked him of his humanity as an individual. If liberals want to live up to their self-purported principles of equality and free inquiry, they would do well to stop treating Clarence Thomas as the scapegoat for their political agendas and start treating him like a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:David Suter For The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James Kirchick is on the editorial staff of The New Republic.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

On a morning walk, tour guide Karl Walter is moving toward more contemporary events.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the walls of Old Jaffa came down in the late 1800s, people started moving to the countryside, he said. Muslims went in one direction, Christians in another. The Jews went north, to a few plots of sand on which they built a school and some houses and started what would become Tel Aviv  --  the first modern Jewish city and a destination for the earliest waves of Zionist immigrants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The city celebrates its centennial this year, its role in the nation changed from point of arrival for emigres to notorious party town and cultural and financial hub  --  a bit Manhattan, a bit L.A., a bit Ibiza, as a morning-to-dusk-to-dawn walk will show.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are those who consider it a fulfillment of Theodore Herzl's early Zionist vision  --  a Jewish city, yes, but one that has a strong bohemian streak, that's creative, tolerant and wide open in its politics. There are others who see it as a bit of an abomination, removed from the daily sense of conflict that runs through cities such as Jerusalem and a place, as one Israeli columnist called it, of ""mass Shabbat desecration.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 400,000 people live in the city proper. But close to half of the country's 7 million people live in Tel Aviv's suburbs or nearby coastal towns, so the dichotomy is a reflection not just of the city but of Israel itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tel Aviv  --  where David Ben-Gurion declared the Jewish state's independence  --  has seen its share of violence, including suicide bombings and Scud missiles launched by Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the southern Tel Aviv waterfront, Walter pointed out the stone house that used to belong to one of Jaffa's Arab leaders. It's in a field where, he said, Jewish forces converged in a battle on the eve of Ben-Gurion's declaration. The house is now a museum.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the Arab families were forced out or fled to the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and elsewhere. A few thousand remained, their descendants clustered in Jaffa neighborhoods that have since been incorporated into a combined municipality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as city conservation director Jeremie Hoffman said, the frame of reference is often different here than in other parts of Israel. Tel Aviv residents are as apt to identify with what's happening in New York and Paris as they are with the small towns of Israel, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hoffman's work is a case in point. In a country defined in some ways by ancient disputes, he is trying to preserve architecture that is only a few decades old  --  the Bauhaus apartments built by immigrants who imported the style from Europe in the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's mid-afternoon, and Hoffman is strolling through downtown neighborhoods where the city has imposed strict rules on renovating hundreds of Bauhaus buildings. The United Nations has designated the area a heritage zone. Apartments that once housed new arrivals are now million-dollar investments. This is not where the new immigrants come anymore  --  it is a second or third step, Hoffman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yael Dayan, chairman of the City Council, said rising property values are on her mind a lot lately. There's discussion of rent-control laws to ensure the city remains affordable for young people starting their careers as well as middle-class families.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She sips a late-afternoon coffee near Rabin Square, where Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995. The world's focus more often rests on Jerusalem, she said, but she's among those who will tell you that Tel Aviv is the heart of Israel's story.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This was Herzl's idea of what the Jewish land should be  --  secular, liberal, pluralistic,"" she said, citing the city's efforts to boost welfare benefits, care for the homeless, and encourage tolerance toward gays and other minorities. She winces a bit when asked about the status of Tel Aviv's Arab citizens, though she said the city has <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies for hiring Israeli Arabs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Tel Aviv is seen as very left-wing, but it keeps its distance,"" Arab mayoral candidate Asma Agbarieh-Zahalka said during her campaign. Redevelopment of some of Jaffa's older neighborhoods, she said, risked gentrifying the few Arab sections that remain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She did not receive many votes, but one person who supported her was writer Avner Bernheimer, who felt putting an Arab woman in charge of the city might stir things up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is just past sundown on Friday night, the start of the Jewish Sabbath. Jerusalem and other more conservative towns are locked up tight to observe the day of rest. In Tel Aviv, it's the start of a party that will run into the early hours.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bernheimer and his partner, architect Eran Neuman, are talking over dinner about their projects. Bernheimer is writing a television movie about human trafficking through the Sinai desert. Neuman has put together one of the centennial celebration's centerpiece displays, a futuristic look at Tel Aviv in which ideas from architecture schools worldwide are pictured on brightly lit, inflatable triangles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But some of the most animated talk over dinner is of their  3-month-old son  --  the mother is a college friend of Neuman's, and Bernheimer is the biological father. Just as it was built on refugees from Europe, they say, Tel Aviv today is a result of its openness  --  to gays, to people with different ideas about politics or art, to those with ambitions they feel they can fulfill here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Friday night becomes Saturday morning. There are discos, clubs and bars tucked into so many alleys.

Recent anti-Semitic incidents spurred the regents to want to take action, but at their Sept. 17 meeting, they chose not to adopt proposed ""principles against intolerance."" Instead, they created a committee to consider the issue anew. The reality, however, is that the chance of a breakthrough is low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Any written policy would need to achieve conflicting goals: expressing a strong commitment to freedom of speech as an integral aspect of education, while seeking to prevent speech that is racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. The trick is in setting the border between heated, even inflammatory, speech and hate speech, which is notoriously difficult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court long has held that vague speech rules violate the 1st Amendment and deny due process of law. In fact, efforts at defining hate speech by other state universities have been declared unconstitutional on vagueness grounds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Michigan, for example, adopted a code in the 1980s -- later struck down by the Supreme Court -- that prohibited ""any behavior, verbal or physical, that stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-era veteran status.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what does it mean to ""stigmatize"" or ""victimize""? If a professor or student agues that there are inherent differences between men and women, does that violate the policy? Can advocacy of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> be deemed to violate this policy because it stigmatizes racial minorities by assuming that they need preferential treatment to compete?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with principles of intolerance, activists on UC campuses are urging the Board of Regents to adopt the State Department definition of anti-Semitism, which includes trying to ""demonize Israel,"" ""delegitimize Israel"" or applying a ""double-standard to Israel."" But who is fit to judge when criticism of Israel's policies and actions veers into demonization? If a student states that Palestinians should have a right of return, is she seeking to delegitimize Israel or just airing a controversial opinion? What if she says the country's founding was a mistake?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the 1st Amendment, there is no such thing as a false idea and all viewpoints may be expressed. The 1st Amendment even protects the right to deny the Holocaust or advocate the subjugation of a supposedly inferior group. There unquestionably is a 1st Amendment right to argue against (or for) the existence of Israel or to contend that it should meet (or not have to meet) higher standards of human rights than other nations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These difficulties have led some campuses to take a softer approach: adopting community speech guidelines or principles, while pledging not to punish those who violate those principles. Campus administrators can feel that they are taking positive actions without fearing constitutional challenges. Also, they can remind students that just because there is a 1st Amendment right to say something, that doesn't mean it should be said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But such middleground policies always seem to leave everyone dissatisfied. Those who want to prevent hate speech see them as toothless or ineffectual because they cannot be enforced. Those who are most concerned about protecting freedom of expression on campus still worry that they will chill speech and inhibit discussion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is there a solution to all of this? Is there anything the regents committee and other universities can try?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My advice would be to draft a policy that focuses on reaffirming the importance of free expression while defining what is not constitutionally protected. There is no 1st Amendment right to threaten or harass another person or to deface someone else's property.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The policy should not seek to inhibit or limit protected speech, no matter how offensive it might be. The policy should seek to define, with as much precision as possible, what types of speech and conduct cross the line and are impermissible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should also remember that universities have the right to free speech too, and can and should speak out against inflammatory speech that targets members of the university community. This, of course, is consistent with the educational mission of universities and a basic principle of the 1st Amendment: the best remedy for the speech we dislike is more speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Erwin Chemerinsky is the dean of the UC Irvine School of Law.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

Being a Chicagoan whose tax dollars helped purchase the microphones, transmitters and speakers via which these hateful, hurtful words have been broadcast, being a Chicagoan whose taxes evidently pay the wages of bigots, that's injury added to the insult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once again, Chicago has been rocked by charges that some of its firefighters aren't comfortable serving many of the people who live here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The five racist radio transmissions of recent weeks have generated more shock than surprise. The transmissions didn't occur in a void. They follow more than three decades of tension within the department since its ranks were belatedly integrated in 1968.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of that tension over the years has stayed within the city's firehouses. On rare occasion, citizens have been able to peer inside, or to listen from afar. What they've seen and heard isn't always ennobling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1997, a videotape surfaced depicting a 1990 firehouse retirement party at which firefighters were drinking, exposing themselves and uttering racial slurs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the firefighters who attended the party, James McNally, now is president of Chicago Fire Fighters Union Local 2. On another occasion, he appeared in black face to protest promotions motivated by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not to say most Chicago firefighters condone racism. But firefighters--provocateurs and innocents alike--do need to appreciate how grave these five radio incidents are, as is the delivery of a death threat to a battalion chief who heads the African American Fire Fighters League of Chicago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are times, particularly when the offenders are young or ignorant, when ugly behavior can be forgiven if not forgotten, when its perpetrators can be redeemed if not encouraged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not one of those times. This behavior, in this department, in this city, is intolerable. There is no wellspring of goodwill upon which an offending firefighter can call, no margin for middling penance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Simply put, these disgusting, dehumanizing incidents follow too much history. Fire Commissioner James Joyce declared last week that ""offenses like these will be fireable offenses."" Translation: Joyce has committed himself to judging each case individually, but he has put every one of his employees on notice that the range of penalties unquestionably includes dismissal. Mayor Richard Daley concurred, stating that a still unidentified person--thought to be a firefighter--who voiced racial slurs broadcast March 1 should admit his action and face the ""ultimate consequences.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is the correct response. When these kinds of calculated affronts to city and department policy occur, when reasonable citizens are left to wonder about the integrity of the firefighters they employ, jobs should--must--be on the line.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But whether Joyce can fulfill his own prophecy is another matter. The department terminated seven firefighters who appeared in the 1990 videotape. They challenged the dismissals before an arbitrator and eventually won back their jobs--with pension and seniority rights, the department says, although without four years of back pay.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Merely identifying whoever has been spewing filth on fire department frequencies isn't easy. One veteran firefighter who voiced racist slander, and a supervisor who didn't react properly, have been suspended over the first of the five incidents. It's likely the subsequent transmissions originated on fire department radios, but in this era of clever hackers and electronic gadgetry, the department isn't yet certain that no outsider is involved. Joyce, though, hasn't sounded like a boss who expects to learn that his own employees are innocent. Last week he denounced an ""underground Web site"" that offered firefighters tips on how to obscure their identities when transmitting over department frequencies. ""That's what we're up against,"" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's also up against an unmeasured amount of denial over society's gradual progress on race. Many of today's Chicago firefighters did come of age in a department culture that to varying degrees rewarded three attributes: skill, courage and clout. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span>, though, is about a fourth, and to some foreign, attribute: fairness. It's understandable, if not admirable, that adding fairness to the mix caused resentment among those who feel that the long-overdue accelerated promotion of minorities--a cause Joyce has advanced--is unfair to some whites who don't get those promotions. What's not understandable is for any Chicago firefighter to permit that or any other frustration to be voiced in the most vicious bigotry imaginable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Firefighters who don't share that bigotry are now in the best position to lead the department out of its difficult past. One important step is to help nail the perpetrators of the radio incidents. Public racism tends to be a team sport. It's likely someone inside or outside the department knows who originated these broadcasts. Stepping forward with that knowledge may require even more courage than racing into a burning house.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But restoring the department's integrity, like rescuing fire victims, is a critical public service. And that cause, public service, should be key to how this sorry drama concludes. Any firefighter who merely wants to fight fire is free to resign and join the U.S. Forest Service. Any firefighter who wants to serve the public--in all its varied hues, in its wide range of good and bad behaviors, in its terrible moments when disaster strikes and panic ensues--is welcome to stay.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, if a firefighter finds himself risking his own life to save the lives of Chicagoans he finds unworthy of his respect, he should find another job. Fire Commissioner Joyce is right to pursue those few who've let that lack of respect get the best of them. The hope here is that he will root them out, adjudicate their cases under the due process to which they're entitled--and subject them to the ultimate consequences Mayor Daley properly threatened last week.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

Just as we need to preserve the sanctity of elections (by prosecuting coup instigators), democracy defenders need to address judicial radicals' gross distortion of our system, resulting in the current Supreme Court's subversion of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unhinged from judicial standards, the court now roves through the policy landscape, overturning decades of law and reordering Americans' lives and institutions. It upends women's health, revamps college admissions, snatches student aid from millions and redefines public accommodations (allowing egregious discrimination). In aggrandizing power, the court illegitimately dominates policymaking, undermining democracy to an extent we have not seen in nearly 100 years. (Ronald Brownstein pointed out that similar constitutional collisions in the 1850s and 1930s took a civil war or threat of court-packing to resolve.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something must change if we want to preserve rule by the people's elected leaders responsible to voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a preliminary matter, it is essential to identify the problem. As morally and politically offensive as Supreme Court decisions on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, LGBTQ+ discrimination and student debt forgiveness might be to millions of Americans, merely criticizing the court's result is misguided and unproductive. The task is to expose the court's disintegration as a legitimate judicial body and note its emergence as a supreme right-wing policymaker. When the court operates on an ends-justify-the-means basis, shreds legal doctrine and dishonestly presents the facts, critics should not play whack-a-mole, decrying each individual rejection of widespread American values. In doing so, the court negates self-government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telltale sign that the justices have become partisan politicians: their refusal to adopt mandatory ethics rules, which destroys the essence of judicial impartiality that is the root of their legitimacy. When judges cease to eliminate conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, they appear indistinguishable from politicians wined and dined in rarefied settings by lobbyists. The stench of financial corruption, coupled with justices' intemperate rants in partisan settings and in op-eds, convinces Americans that the justices are partisan players out to score points for their own side.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, the court strays out of its constitutional lane when it refuses to follow consistent rules of construction and honestly address cases' facts. When, for example, the majority casts aside stare decisis (as in the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> case) without admitting it or refuses to apply the test for departing from precedent (as in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization), it is simply muscling its way to desired outcomes because it has the votes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worse, cases are now manufactured to create policy. The majority has made complete hash out of standing and concepts such as ""case and controversy"" to reach decisions it had no business deciding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the student loan debt relief case, the court created standing out of whole cloth. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, ""The requirement that the proper party — the party actually affected — challenge an action ensures that courts do not overstep their proper bounds. … Without that requirement, courts become 'forums for the ventilation of public grievances' — for settlement of ideological and political disputes."" Here the court deliberately ignored that the aggrieved party was not a litigant. Likewise, in the case of a web designer worried about selling her services to a gay couple (who appear to be fabricated), the court defied every principle of standing. When the court goes beyond actual cases and controversies to answer hypotheticals, it goes beyond its constitutional mandate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, worst of all, the newfangled ""major questions doctrine"" allows the court to subjectively decide when the issue is of ""major political salience"" (whatever the court says it is); if so, the court demands the application at issue be specifically authorized by statute (a standard lawmakers somehow never meet in this court's eyes). It has become a crutch whenever the court seeks to invalidate a program it doesn't like. In the student debt relief case, the court reached the desired result by ignoring the word ""waive"" in the statute authorizing loan forgiveness to reach the finding that Congress hadn't delegated power to, well, waive student debt. ""[T]he Court once again substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch — and the hundreds of millions of people they represent — in making this Nation's most important, as well as most contested, policy decisions,"" Kagan wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mumbo-jumbo ""major questions doctrine"" is not the stuff of judging. No wonder the chief justice got touchy when Kagan pointed out that the court ""is supposed to stick to its business — to decide only cases and controversies and to stay away from making this Nation's policy about subjects like student-loan relief."" What the Slaughter-House Cases and substantive due process were to the New Deal-era right-wing court, the ""major questions doctrine"" is to the current court: a smokescreen for enforcing a right-wing agenda (or vetoing a progressive one).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In departing from the authentic judicial review, the right-wing majority unsurprisingly produces results perfectly aligned with the right's agenda on hot-button topics. (By the law of averages, its ""analysis"" should occasionally favor the other side.) When foretelling a case's outcome or following the majority's ""reasoning"" requires a crib sheet on GOP political aims, something is wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And voters have figured out what's going on. According to an ABC News-Ipsos poll, 53 percent ""believe that the nation's highest court rules mainly on the basis of their partisan political view rather than on the basis of the law (33%), while 14% say they don't know."" Before the Dobbs opinion, a separate January 2022 poll showed that ""38% of Americans believed that the justices rule mainly on the basis of law, versus 43% who believed that the court rules on the basis of their political views.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The transformation of the court into a partisan player contradicts the central premise of democracy. We should reject the obtuse and naive argument that this court isn't so bad because it didn't entirely obliterate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and declined to impose the outrageous independent state legislature doctrine. Now is no time for self-delusion. Ending the right-wing majority's intolerable war on self-government will require that the other two branches and the voters cut the court down to size. A single election or a single reform might not suffice. Cogent law review articles, informed public debate and exquisite dissents revealing that the right-wing judicial emperors have no clothes can assist reformers. Term limits, jurisdiction stripping, court expansion and ethics reform should be on the table. Simply put, if we want democracy to survive, each election must be a referendum on the court's legitimacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On this Independence Day, which celebrates rebellion against a monarch lacking consent of the governed, it behooves us to dedicate ourselves to robust and authentic democracy — government of the people, by the people, for the people — not by arrogant right-wing justices.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

It is New York City's crown jewel, where - like in the fictional Lake Wobegon - all the students really are ""above average."" And just to make matters more intriguing and complicated, Stuyvesant's student body is majority Asian American</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>. The mayor thinks this is a ""monumental injustice"" and that more of the students should be Hispanic and black. For that, he recently asked congregants at a black church for an ""amen.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, from certain critics, he got a groan of opposition and disbelief. In the name of racial equity, fairness and that most deceptive of all words, diversity, he would demolish a system that at Stuyvesant and seven other elite city high schools has, without a doubt, propelled countless poor kids right into the middle class - and beyond.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason I mentioned Trump in the first paragraph is that his base consists, in no small part, of white males who think the deck is stacked against them; that the liberal policies of the Obama years, personified by Hillary Clinton, unfairly favored other groups or, when it came to trade, other nations. You and I may quibble with this view, but then along comes Mayor Bill de Blasio to demand an ""amen"" to his efforts to tilt a color-blind admissions system to get a different blend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Blacks and Hispanics comprise 67 percent</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>of New York's public school students. Yet Stuyvesant's incoming freshman class contains only 10 black students, 27 Hispanics, 151 whites - and 613 Asian Americans. A similar imbalance applies to the city's seven other elite schools, including Brooklyn Tech, where the mayor's son just graduated. Clearly, something is off. In the best of all possible worlds, these schools should have student bodies that reflect the city's demographics. This, though, is not the best of all worlds. It's the one we have.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And in this world, the children of Asian immigrants walk away with the lion's share of admissions. Why? Simple. They study. They study hard. Admissions to New York's academically elite schools is based solely on an entrance exam. That's it. No alumni recommendations. No offer of a contribution. No athletic ability or anything of the sort. Take the test. Score high. Get in. Nothing could be fairer. Yet, de Blasio, a Democrat, wants to do away with the exam all together.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an exhaustive piece for the City Journal about Brooklyn's Chinese American community - one of New York's several Chinatowns - Kay S. Hymowitz writes that ""If, as sometimes appears the case, 'Harvard' is the first English word that immigrant Chinese mothers learn, the second is probably 'Stuyvesant.' ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reading Hymowitz's description of how these parents work around the clock for their children - rising before dawn to ensure that homework is done - is exhausting in itself. Often, they put aside money to have their kids prepped for the Stuyvesant admissions test. This is not a perk of the rich. This is yet another sacrifice these parents make for their children.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My limited tolerance for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> - possibly permissible when the poor are advantaged at the expense of the rich - hits a wall in this case. By and large, the Asian Americans of Stuyvesant are not rich. Many of them are poor, so-called Title I kids, entitled to all sorts of aid. They and their parents played by the rules and studied hard. Why should they be deprived - on the basis of race or ethnicity - of what they earned? That's what the mayor wants to happen. Asian American kids have to make way for black or Hispanic ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The figures are both stark and tragic. But they prove, to the obstinate blindness of the doctrinaire, that poverty is not always the determinant. You can hardly get poorer than many of the Asian immigrants. They come to America with little. Many can't even speak English. In her article, Hymowitz says Chinese families often ""maintain that they have been discriminated against, and they tell their children to expect discrimination as well."" It's a hard, hard life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already, the mayor has reserved some slots for students whoalmostpass the exam so that more black and Hispanic kids will be admitted to the special schools. For him, it is only a beginning. In the name of diversity, he wants to scrap the test and, thereby, destroy a system that epitomized the American dream and - as Trump might say - made America great.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>cohenr@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Richard Cohen</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
6409220c6166510beff12d14	test_question_pro_testing_1	"<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?

Sebelius does he use the word ""integrity."" Even so, in the days since the individual mandate was upheld as a tax, concern for the ""integrity"" or ""legitimacy"" or ""reputation"" of the Roberts Court has become the most accepted explanation for why the chief justice ruled as he did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus Reuters, which tells us that Justice Roberts was ""trying to preserve the integrity of the judiciary in polarized Washington."" Or the New York Times, where Tom Friedman lauds the chief justice for ""a simple noble leadership impulse at a critical juncture in our history -- to preserve the legitimacy of the Supreme Court."" The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer agrees with this motivation, speculating that had Justice Roberts ""been just an associate justice, and not the chief"" he might well have voted otherwise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Krauthammer is correct, it raises a disquieting question. During Justice Roberts's confirmation hearings back in 2005, he described judges as umpires whose job it is to call balls and strikes as he sees them. The idea that he might have voted otherwise if he were not chief justice suggests that a ""strike"" was changed to a ""ball"" because of concerns for how the straight call would be perceived.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let us stipulate that there's nothing wrong with a justice who starts out with one opinion but changes his mind as he reviews the facts and arguments. Let us agree too that the reputation of the court is a legitimate concern of any justice. The fundamental difficulty remains: a labored lead opinion that looks like a conclusion struggling for a rationale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unless Justice Roberts tells us, we will never know for sure. Still, the circumstantial evidence is persuasive. For one thing, against the contrivance of the lead opinion there is the clarity of a united dissent that we now understand started out as a majority view with Justice Roberts's support. That clarity likewise characterizes two separate decisions by conservative federal appellate judges -- Laurence Silberman and Jeffrey Sutton -- who upheld the individual mandate as a penalty under the Commerce Clause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also hard not to notice that people now extolling Justice Roberts for rescuing the court's integrity are largely the same ones who have been impugning it. That's especially true of the White House, which had made plain that if the Supreme Court had gone the other way on health care, the Roberts Court would become a major target of Obama's re-election campaign. The chief justice knows how ugly that might be, having sat through the president's crass political attack on his court during the 2010 State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As more than one conservative has pointed out, the integrity of liberal justices who reliably line up for whatever outcome is desired by the Democratic Party goes unquestioned. Indeed, the definition of integrity assumes one direction. For example, the one notable occasion when the Supreme Court specifically invoked integrity was back in 1992 (Planned Parenthood v. Casey), when the court used it to justify reaffirming Roe v. Wade's conclusion -- a constitutional right to abortion -- while rejecting the reasoning that led to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, in that case the court was deferring to a previous judicial power grab and not to the people acting through their elected representatives. Still, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's clarifying rebuke is well worth reprising here: ""Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perception -- a job not for lawyers but for political campaign managers -- the Justices should do what is legally right.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia's dissent in Casey illuminates a political handicap imposed on conservatives by their own principles. Whereas the liberal belief in a living Constitution allows them to stretch its limits to justify almost any desired outcome, conservatives believe the Constitution imposes real limits. The chief justice's tax argument rankles because no one else in America is buying it: certainly not the conservative dissenters, who firmly reject it, nor the court liberals, who appear to have winked because it gave them the outcome they wanted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The day after the ruling came down, this newspaper carried an article that explained Justice Roberts's decision this way: ""By confounding charges that the court is too partisan, the chief justice might have earned sufficient political capital to move to the right during the next term, when the court will likely confront a host of hot-button issues, including <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage and the continued vitality of the Voting Rights Act.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If earning ""sufficient political capital"" is simply a consequence of his ruling, Justice Roberts cannot be blamed. If it was the aim, however, and it led to his voting as chief justice in a way he would not have voted as an associate justice, he has raised rather than resolved questions about the integrity of the Roberts court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Knots of journalists could be seen in animated conversation in the newsroom. ""What do you think?"" one would ask, and then a heated discussion would follow. Were they talking about the Unabomber and the decision of The Post to publish his modest tome? No. The hot subject was a published criticism of The Post's <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The venue was the New Republic, and the author was Ruth Shalit. Not only did she find ""racial strife"" at The Post but she accused the paper of so slavishly adhering to its <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> goals that it had lowered its standards in both hiring and news coverage. At The Post, she alleged, the best man does not always win -- an assertion that does not conform with what I know. Shalit has that part wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The editor of The Post, Leonard Downie Jr., vividly said as much. ""False,"" ""amateurish,"" ""shameful,"" ""racial McCarthyism"" and ""big-lie propaganda"" are some of the words he used. The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham, was equally exercised, and noted that the New Republic ""has never had a full-time black staffer."" He suggested a motto for the magazine: ""Looking for a qualified black since 1914."" In the areas of hiring standards and news coverage, The Post's response was so detailed as to be convincing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, it was deviously clever of Shalit to choose The Washington Post to write about what, in effect, was <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. After all, The Post is a liberal institution -- and I am not talking about its editorial positions (not all that liberal) or its supposed political line (nonexistent).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I am talking, instead, of its benevolent corporate culture. Firings are rare, layoffs nonexistent. Its journalists are relatively well paid, and they work for an organization about which they feel immense pride. I mean, the Unabomber didn't pick any ol' rag to blackmail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even here <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has produced ""racial strife."" The Post's announced goal is to have minorities make up 25 percent of its new hires and women 50 percent. To that end, it has established an operation within the newsroom that, among other things, is responsible for recruiting minorities and women. The Post is adamant that its goals not be perceived as quotas, and, as with Ford, quality remains job one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, to a white male a message has been sent. He feels himself operating under a quota system, and no amount of assurance that goals are not quotas is going to ameliorate the emotional impact. Somehow, a goal feels like a quota, and a quota feels unfair. The Post insists its standards have not been lowered. Okay. But for white males, a barrier appears to have been raised.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Washington Post-New Republic dustup may seem a parody of inside-the-Beltway nonsense, but the issues raised are hardly parochial. The newspaper business is similar to many others -- it's contracting. Newspapers are folding or merging. Even apparently thriving ones conduct themselves as if bankruptcy is just around the corner, laying off employees, killing certain editions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of America is like that. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span>, conceived in an era when economic growth seemed an American birthright, has become a lot harder to sell in a time of economic insecurity. Under those circumstances, it gets a lot harder to accept a program whose central premise -- that race (or sex) ought to be taken into account in hiring or promotion -- runs counter to the American creed. What once seemed worth trying (despite some reservations) is now seen as downright threatening.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond what <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has come to mean to many whites, it is hardly an unalloyed boon to blacks. No doubt, it has done some good. When Colin Powell proclaims himself an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> baby, we are all obligated to pay attention to what he's saying. But attention also should be paid to the pained reaction of black journalists to the New Republic piece. Using unattributed quotes, it charged that some incompetent people had been hired simply on account of race. If such people exist, I don't know them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I admire what The Post is attempting -- and anyway, I can't imagine a newspaper without a diversified staff. I know the paper's managers and their deep commitment to racial justice -- to whites as well as nonwhites. But this utilization of ethnic, racial and sexual categories in hiring inevitably sets one group against another. The standard for success is not in reaching a certain percentage but in turning out a better newspaper. Numerical goals, while understandable, ought to be replaced by only one: absolute nondiscrimination.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes
656386041faf6ea76e9ad688	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1548604795.xml.txt	"<div><p>U.T. Austin's affirmative action program is a careful effort to ensure diversity (Posted 2014-07-28 00:15:53)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LAST YEAR, the Supreme Court ordered the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to reconsider the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> program at the University of Texas at Austin. This month, the appeals court determined again that the university's admissions policies were constitutional. This was not much of a surprise: The 5th Circuit sided with the university the last time it examined this case. Much less predictable is how the Supreme Court will rule when the dispute comes before the justices for a second time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We wouldn't accuse them of having an easy task. Every American should be wary of any instance in which the government distinguishes between people based on race, with bad or good motivations. But in its ruling, the 5th Circuit offered the justices several good reasons to side with the university. Among them: If, as the justices have said, the Constitution can bear public universities instituting some kind of narrow, careful <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> admissions policies, UT Austin's modest program is a prime example of the sort that should survive judicial scrutiny.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Texas fills most of the seats at its premier public university with students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school classes -- state policy guarantees them admission. This has had the effect of drawing some students from areas of the state where minorities make up the majority without distinguishing among students based on race. The case is about what the university can do from there. UT fills the rest of its classes with students who get in under a comprehensive, holistic review of their academic and personal records. In that analysis, race can be used as ""a factor of a factor of a factor of a factor,"" as advocates put it, as admissions officers assemble a complete picture of an applicant's profile. The 5th Circuit points out that this resembles the sort of individualized review of applicants that the Supreme Court has insisted must occur if race is to be explicitly considered in public university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university's opponents charge that the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> policy is unnecessary. The top 10 percent program already pulls in minority students. Why do any more?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the reasons are the fact that the top 10 percent scheme's effects on diversity stem from ongoing racial segregation in Texas schools. The scheme also is a blunt tool that overlooks applicants who want to and would contribute to the university. The experience of a minority applicant from a majority minority school, for example, may well be quite different than that of a minority applicant from a majority white school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another lesson from the 5th Circuit's ruling: One reason this and other <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> cases are difficult is that the Supreme Court has not offered public university officials clear guidance on what is constitutionally acceptable. According to the court, public universities, for example, can attempt to achieve a ""critical mass"" of minority students on campus to expose students to diverse viewpoints and prepare them to participate in a multi-ethnic society. What a ""critical mass"" looks like, though, is not certain. The Supreme Court should clear up the confusion. In the process, the justices should affirm that UT's conscientiously designed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> program, a cautious effort to complement the race-neutral top 10 percent program and seek diversity from a range of student profiles, is permissible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
656386041faf6ea76e9ad688	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2100741387.xml.txt	"<div><p>ANALYSIS; Senate testimony insights; Kavanaugh's Supreme Court hearing shows growing partisanship, but reveals little about his views on the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week's Senate hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh lived up to -- or perhaps down to -- expectations for how modern-day justices are confirmed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A sharp partisan divide was on display from the first minute and lasted until the bitter end. In an unprecedented move on the first day, Democrats tried to shut down the hearing by complaining that Republicans were withholding documents about Kavanaugh's record. Republicans accused Democrats of political grandstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it was all over, the highly qualified and reliably conservative judge was headed for approval in the Senate Judiciary Committee, albeit with Republican votes only.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This surely has been the most contentious hearing since [Clarence] Thomas"" in 1991, said University of Georgia law professor Lori Ringhand, who has written a history of court confirmation hearings. ""Cooperation among the committee members seems to have completely broken down.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She said the hearing continued the trend of revealing less and less about a nominee's views. ""Kavanaugh seemed to provide firm answers to even fewer substantive questions than [Justice Neil M.] Gorsuch, who provided fewer firm answers than any nominee for decades. In my opinion, this strips the process of much of its value.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Thomas confirmation in 1991 had stood alone as unusually contentious for two reasons. Thomas was a 43-year-old black conservative with a thin record when he was tapped to succeed Justice Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights legend. And after a week of hearings, the public learned that Anita Hill, a former aide, had accused him of sexual harassment. Nonetheless, Thomas won confirmation on a 52-48 vote in a Senate controlled by Democrats. He then joined a court where most of the justices had won unanimous Senate confirmation, including Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, there has been a steady decline in the number of senators who will cross party lines to confirm a high court nominee. In 1993, President Clinton's first nominee, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, won with a 96-3 vote. In 2005, President George W. Bush's first nominee, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., won on a 78-22 vote. In 2009, President Obama's first nominee, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, won on a 68-31 vote. And last year, Gorsuch, President Trump's first nominee, won by a 54-45 vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was the lone Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee to support Obama's nominees. On Thursday, he bemoaned the raucous partisanship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""People wonder,"" he said, ""are these hearings turning into a circus?"" But Graham said this was not fair nor accurate. ""Circuses are entertaining, and you can take your children to them. This hearing is neither entertaining nor appropriate for young people."" He referred to the regular shout-outs from protesters who were dragged from the hearing room.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators from both major parties often speak of their desire for a ""neutral"" judge who will simply follow the law and rule fairly without bias. But their actions tell a different story.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the Republicans joined together in 2016 to block even a hearing for a highly qualified Obama nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now all the Democrats, at least on the committee, are united in their opposition to Kavanaugh to fill the seat of the recently retired Kennedy, the high court's swing justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservative scholars credited Kavanaugh with a strong, steady performance amid the partisan squabbling. ""He is an experienced, thoughtful and intelligent mainstream judicial conservative. I do not believe we learned anything new about him, but we have learned a bit about the new normal in terms of collegiality in the Senate and the depth of activists' frustration with the administration,"" said Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Women's rights advocates and liberal scholars were not reassured by his testimony. ""Our fears about the future of this country deepened this week when Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly refused to answer questions about his views on abortion, employment discrimination, immigration and healthcare. Our civil rights, dignity and autonomy will be in grave danger if he is confirmed,"" said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, pointed to the jarring contrast between Kavanaugh's public praise for the Brown vs. Board of Education school desegregation ruling and his private White House memos deriding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies. ""Seeing him use words like 'naked racial set-aside' and 'racial spoils system' to refer to race-conscious measures intended to redress entrenched systemic racism is upsetting,"" Wydra said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump promised to appoint justices who would vote to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that established a woman's right to choose abortion, and Democrats pressed Kavanaugh to explain his views. He repeatedly said Roe was a ""precedent,"" but would not say it was correctly decided.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he described the 1974 ruling in United States vs. Nixon, which required the president to turn over the Watergate tapes, as correct and one of the great moments in the court's history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cornell law professor Michael Dorf was a clerk for Kennedy in 1992, when the court reaffirmed the right to abortion in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, and said Kavanaugh's comments did not signal he would uphold abortion rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Understood in context, he said very little,"" Dorf said, except that Roe and Casey are precedents. ""There is good reason to think that in addition to Justice Thomas, Chief Justice Roberts and Justices [Samuel A.] Alito and Gorsuch would overrule Roe if presented with the opportunity,"" he said. If so, he said, Kavanaugh could supply the fifth vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When asked about same-sex marriage, Kavanaugh took a different approach that may be significant. He spoke of a passage from Kennedy's opinion in June in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case that endorsed equal rights for gays and lesbians. Kavanaugh noted correctly that nearly all the justices, including the leading conservatives, signed the opinion, which -- as he paraphrased it -- said that ""the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans, or gay and lesbian couples, as second-class citizens or inferior in dignity or worth are over in the Supreme Court. That's a very important statement.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) had asked him to say whether the 2015 ruling in Obergefell vs. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage was correctly decided. It is a ""yes or no"" question, she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kavanaugh refused to answer, repeating his statement that a nominee should not give a ""thumbs-up or thumbs-down"" response to recent rulings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leading gay rights advocates said they were not reassured. They noted the court in the Masterpiece case ruled that the Colorado cake maker was treated unfairly based on his Christian beliefs. Sharon McGowan, a lawyer for the gay rights advocacy group Lambda Legal, said Kavanaugh's ""bobbing and weaving to avoid endorsing Obergefell speaks volumes. It signals not only to us, but also to his most fervent supporters, that he is prepared to grant religious opt-outs from nondiscrimination laws that are designed to protect LGBT people and their families.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the next year, the court is likely to take up another religious rights case, possibly from a florist in western Washington state who refused to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. The court's conservatives are likely to look favorably on her claim for a religious exemption from the state's civil rights law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is no sign the court's conservatives are interested in revisiting the issue of same-sex marriage. Abortion remains highly disputed, and several Republican-led states are likely to enact bans on abortion that will send the issue back before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, conservative lawmakers are not pressing to enact new bans on same-sex marriage, and as Kavanaugh's comment suggested, there is no reason to believe such a challenge would be welcome at the high court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>david.savage@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: BRETT KAVANAUGH takes a break Thursday from his confirmation hearing with former players of a youth basketball team he coached.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Drew Angerer Getty Images</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Defenders argue that ending racial preferences would ""dilute decades of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies introduced to help Malays catch up with the generally wealthier ethnic Chinese,"" who comprise less than a quarter of the population.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> in Malaysia began in the 1950s, after the British colonial administrators, who had welcomed laborers from China, departed. Since 1971, Malays have enjoyed preferential treatment over their Chinese compatriots in everything from schooling and housing to government jobs and access to capital. The government's express goal was ""racial balance,"" and to that end Malay entrepreneurs were given preference in obtaining credit, licenses and government contracts. Developers offer Malays discounts on new homes, and shopping centers have even banned ethnic-Chinese-owned businesses to limit competition with Malay proprietors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These policies were supposed to sunset in 1991, but the country's leaders have repeatedly extended them in exchange for political support. ""Schemes favouring Malays were once deemed essential to improve the lot of Malaysia's least wealthy racial group,"" explains the Economist magazine, but ""these days they are widely thought to help mostly the well-off within that group, while failing the poor and aggravating ethnic tensions.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To anyone who has followed the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> debate in the U.S., a lot of this probably sounds familiar. Like their Malay counterparts, American proponents of racial double standards say they are necessary to help the underprivileged, even though the beneficiaries tend to be people who were already well-off to begin with. Liberal politicians defend color-conscious policies to win votes, and courts assure us the policies will not exist in perpetuity. ""We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,"" wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in a 2003 Supreme Court decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it has in Malaysia, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> continues to stoke racial and ethnic tensions in the U.S., especially in education. Harvard is being sued for discrimination against Asian applicants. The plaintiffs say Asians are held to higher standards than other applicants to limit their numbers on campus. Harvard insists that more Asians aren't admitted because they aren't as multidimensional as their non-Asian peers, an argument eerily similar to the one Ivy League schools once used to discriminate against Jews.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has angered the parents of white and Asian students by pushing for racial quotas at the city's top public high schools. Some 80% of black and Hispanic students in New York City's traditional public schools perform below grade level in reading and math. Is it really any wonder that black and Hispanic students are underrepresented at elite schools that use an admission test? Unfortunately, the mayor and his supporters would rather scrap the test than focus on doing a better job of preparing kids to take it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the debate domestically often centers on the legality of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and whether it's permitted under our constitution, a more practical concern is whether these policies actually work as intended--here in America or in other countries where they've been implemented. Malaysia's racial preferences have been in place for more than 50 years, and the Malays still haven't caught up to the ethnic Chinese, who outperform them in school and in the workforce. The gap has narrowed over the past half-century, but it remains significant, and attributing Malay progress to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is dubious. For one thing, Malays in neighboring Singapore, which has no <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and where they are a minority, are better off economically than the Malays in Malaysia, who receive favorable treatment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs in the U.S. are regularly given undeserved credit for expanding the size of the black middle class. The reality is that the most dramatic declines in black poverty preceded <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs, which began in earnest in the 1970s. Black incomes doubled in the 1960s--before <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. And blacks were entering middle-class professions at a much faster clip in the decades preceding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than they did in the decades following its implementation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the University of California system ended race-based admissions in 1996, more blacks enrolled and a higher percentage of them not only graduated but obtained degrees in the more challenging fields of engineering and science. Policies intended to help sometimes do the opposite, whether they are implemented in the U.S. or halfway around the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Jason L.

An F1 career blasts off</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lewis Hamilton is more than just Formula One's first black driver. We could be witnessing the arrival of a Tiger Woods on wheels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hamilton, 22, is off to the best start ever for an F1 rookie-- ever!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And at the highest level of automobile racing in the world, he's in some serious historical company: Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Jackie Stewart, Emerson Fittipaldi, Jimmy Clark . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His breakthrough victory could come as soon as Sunday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>F1 is abuzz with the numerology of Hamilton's onslaught: third in the season-opening Grand Prix of Australia, second last Sunday in Malaysia, so why not first in Bahrain this weekend?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When he wins may be a matter of when his McLaren-Mercedes team gives him the green light to go all out. So far he has been following F1 protocol for a junior driver, which is to defer to the senior teammate--in this case Fernando Alonso, who at 25 has won world championships the last two years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You have to understand the subtleties of F1 to get the entire meaning of what Hamilton said to his team via radio last Sunday, seconds after completing one of the most captivating second-place drives by anyone, rookie or not, in memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The radio transmission was uplinked to the world by satellite TV.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I want to win,"" Hamilton said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, of course he does. But you could read that not as a simple expression of ambition, but as a request to McLaren team boss Ron Dennis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Doesn't matter if it's the next race,"" Hamilton continued in the accent of his birthplace, England. ""But sometime this year, I'm going to have one.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider Hamilton's Malaysian drive:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He started fourth, but quickly, artfully, slipped past both Ferraris--better, quicker cars than his McLaren--into second place, falling in behind teammate Alonso, who had jumped from second into the lead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From there, Hamilton's job was not to challenge Alonso, but to fight a defensive action to hold off the favored Ferraris so Alonso could get away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Hamilton did, all race, in electrifying ways at times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Felipe Massa--whom Ferrari deems its rising star--tried three times to get around Hamilton. Three times Hamilton darted back ahead, making Massa look worse each time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I was able to trick him,"" Hamilton said afterward in an uplinked news conference, ""into out-braking himself, to the point that he went off [into the grass, on the third try].</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I apologize for that,"" Hamilton said, and then smiled with polite ruthlessness. ""But we have the points, so it doesn't really matter.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With 14 season points, Hamilton is third in the world championship standings, only four behind leader Alonso. That's the highest standing ever for a rookie at this point in a season. Only one other driver, Peter Arundel in 1964, scored podium finishes in his first two starts--a pair of thirds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Later in the Malaysian race Hamilton held off Kimi Raikkonen, widely considered the quickest driver in the world now that Schumacher has retired, in the other Ferrari. Alonso won easily because Hamilton fought the war. That's how it works in F1. But Hamilton was more impressive than his world-champion teammate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is but a touch of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in Hamilton's story-- just enough to be fair in the unspeakably expensive world of international formula racing. He has taken it from there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His father, Anthony Hamilton, born in England to immigrants from Grenada, bought Lewis a go-kart when he was 8. The youngster was so good that by age 13 he was signed to a developmental contract by McLaren's Dennis and Mercedes-Benz racing director Norbert Haug.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By 2005, Hamilton was making Dennis and Haug look prescient, dominating the F3 Euroseries with 15 victories and 13 poles. Then last year he soared through the GP2 series, the final stepping stone to F1, winning the championship on his first try.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Hamilton still might be waiting in the pipeline of the McLaren-Mercedes system if not for an ironic twist to what NASCAR considered its greatest coup yet toward driver diversity: the defection of Colombian star Juan Pablo Montoya from F1.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most monumental aspect of Montoya's move may turn out to be that it left a seat open at McLaren: the one Hamilton has filled so dazzlingly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ehinton@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: Lewis Hamilton gleefully displays his second-place trophy in Malaysia last Sunday.

656386041faf6ea76e9ad688	test_question_pro_testing_2	"<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

Critics, of whom there are many, call it an overpriced indulgence for the affluent few who do not have to worry about earning a living upon graduation. Fewer and fewer of today's undergraduates are pursuing the liberal arts, with most of them studying practical subjects like finance, marketing, real estate and pharmacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But James O. Freedman, 67, the retired president of Dartmouth, remains more committed than ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Liberal education opens our eyes to what life is principally about,'' he said. ''It's about understanding yourself and having some resources to deal with everything life throws at you. It's about developing a moral compass and some understanding of how society works, how democracies work.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At home in Cambridge, with his new book, ''Liberal Education and the Public Interest'' (University of Iowa Press, 2003), an ode to the value of liberal education, on the coffee table in front of him, Mr. Freedman makes his case with passion. Contrary to what critics might say, when it comes to getting a job in today's economy, Mr. Freedman says a liberal education is an important advantage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''A liberal education is what teaches people how to write and how to think and makes them much more valuable in the job market over a 40-year career than graduates of a preprofessional program,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''All the employers will tell you that they're seeking the flexibility of mind that a liberal education imbues.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His book came out in January, as he was battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system. The chemotherapy he has been undergoing since September is working.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the fall, with a tumor pressing against the nerves of his lower back, he was using a wheelchair. Now, he needs only a cane to navigate the stairs of the Victorian home he shares with his wife, Sheba.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is Mr. Freedman's fourth bout with cancer since 1994, and just as he writes in his book that a liberal education enables us to see life more clearly, so has he looked clearly at his illness. The odds are that it will return again in a year, he says, and while he hopes to watch his three small grandchildren grow up, he says, there is no way of knowing just how many years he has.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is focusing, as ever, on writing, and speaking out for the liberal values that he has spent his lifetime working for and that he now sees eroding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Life is what we are doing now,'' he writes in his book, reflecting upon the importance of an early commitment to the values of liberal arts, equal education, idealism and public service.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his desk upstairs are a thousand pages of his fourth book: a memoir that moves from his growing up as the son of a high school English teacher in Manchester, N.H., to his undergraduate days at Harvard, where, he says, he was too timid and conventional to be a brilliant student, and on to Yale Law School, where he blossomed intellectually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The book ends at age 27, when he was a law clerk for Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, one of his heroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman put his knowledge of the law to use recently, when, as a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, he helped prepare a brief for the United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The future of America depends on educating minority men and women,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his 11 years as president of Dartmouth, Mr. Freedman devoted himself to making the college welcoming to what he called the creative loners, cellists, poets and mathematicians, as well as athletes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also carved out a role as a public intellectual, standing up to a group of right-wing students -- and their prominent, adult benefactors -- who were ridiculing blacks, homosexuals, women and Jews on campus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making their views known through the neoconservative, off-campus Dartmouth Review, the students ran a front page cartoon that showed Mr. Freedman, who is Jewish, dressed like Adolf Hitler. Eventually, tolerance and civility were restored.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last September, concerned by news reports that Jewish students were being intimidated on campuses amid protests over the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Freedman helped collect signatures from 310 college presidents for a statement calling for ''intimidation-free'' campuses. Some presidents criticized the statement for focusing only on Jewish students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With heavy snow falling on the streets of Cambridge, Mr. Freedman was relaxing in his living room, with Sheba, his wife of nearly 40 years, across from him. They were surrounded by some of Mr. Freedman's 2,000 favorite books, by T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, Saul Bellow, Faulkner, Joyce.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lifelong book collector, Mr. Freedman reluctantly parted with 4,000 other favorites when he left Dartmouth -- and the library at the president's house -- for Cambridge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward evening, the doorbell rang. Howard Gardner, the Harvard educational psychologist who is one of Mr. Freedman's closest friends, came in from the snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In retirement, as an elder statesman of academia, Mr. Freedman's advice is sought frequently. Professor Gardner wanted to consult with him about three academics who needed jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman is ''the ultimate search engine,'' Professor Gardner said, ''because he knows so many people, in so many ways, heart, mind, spirit.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Life is unpredictable and full of disappointment, Mr. Freedman writes in his book, the breakup of marriages, death of loved ones, enduring illness. In such a world, he writes, ''how ought one to lead a life?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''That is one of the questions that a liberal education addresses,'' he writes. ''The most effective protection against the contingencies of experience are values that appeal to our very best natures and anchor us most securely in the ocean of fate.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are the kinds of subjects Dr. Donald Kaufman, one of Mr. Freedman's oncologists, says he enjoys discussing with the former college president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''I always reserve 30 minutes for his visits,'' Dr. Kaufman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''They go on for 90. This is for my benefit, not his. He's teaching me what it means to be a patient. He's teaching people how to live.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James O. Freedman, right, the retired president of Dartmouth, with his friend Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist. Mr. Freedman's new book contends that when it comes to getting a job, a well-rounded education is a major advantage. (C. J. Gunther for The New York Times)</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

It would be nice if CEO Peter Bijur would now lob a few bons mots at journalistic sanctimony, although this seems unlikely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we can still enjoy the larger point: There was a time when journalists aspired to the sensibility of novelists, to some semblance of psychological depth, rather than running around like salivating trolls playing ""gotcha."" This would have been an excellent opportunity for that earlier breed to assert themselves, given the gift of the tapes -- a fly-on-the-wall peek at real life that every journalist dreams of.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But of course the ""n"" word has become such a taboo, the mere rumor of its utterance becomes a salacious story by itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this case another hackneyed stereotype was thrown into the mix -- EVIL BUSINESSMEN -- and a whole seven-day news conflagration was built on a lie. The transcripts provided by the attorneys, of course, were abysmal. But even the transcripts make it clear that Mr. Ulrich is referring to everyone at Texaco as jelly beans, regardless of color: ""You can't have just `we' and `them.' You can't just have black jelly beans and other jelly beans. It doesn't work.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jelly beans were in the air at Texaco: On an earlier bit of tape, Mr. Lundwall is heard saying ""yum"" and offering a female colleague a jelly bean. (She declines.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even more amazing was the failure to draw on the depth of insight available from the tapes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They were secretly recorded by a participant whose motives remain a mystery: Richard Lundwall, a manager in the finance department, was subsequently let go; his tapes seem to consist of random incidents from a day in the life Texaco. We hear him straightening out the matter of a departed employee who may have swiped a laptop. We hear him waxing lyrical over the filet mignon at the Texaco cafeteria. We hear him making nondescript phone calls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But most of all, we peer into his department as it wrestles with conflicting goals that should have sent journalistic synapses firing in all directions, awakening the slumbering cognitive organ: downsizing and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the tapes make clear over and over, Texaco's finance department was being prodded from on high to reduce costs by getting rid of bodies. ""We shrink very systematically,"" one manager is heard saying. ""We absorb the job and do a lot of crosstraining."" In another instance: ""Everybody who leaves, leaves with a smile on their face"" -- referring to the effort to coax people out the door with early retirement and generous severance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We also hear survivors comparing their lot with those who left, including some who jumped to Wall Street. This prompts a discussion about the relative advantages of packing your lifetime earnings into a few stress-laden, workaholic years or spreading them out over a 30-year career of easy hours at Texaco.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But along with downsizing, the department was being pushed to upsize minority and female representation. At one point Mr. Lundwall suggests recruiting at ""Howard or Temple or [other] predominantly black schools"" where students are allowed to advance ""simply on the basis of scholastic merit."" Other MBA programs, he says, are ""under the same gun as corporations"" to promote by quota.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it bothered anybody to be firing colleagues while recruiting minorities, it doesn't show. But there is evidence of stress over race within the organization -- far more interesting and reliable evidence than an indecipherable word that some self-interested lawyer claims is ""nigger.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lundwall jokes about wearing his Viking hat during National Odin Month -- ""I'm celebrating my heritage."" Then he and Mr. Ulrich riff about the ""black"" national anthem, which evidently some Texaco employees had sung at a company event the previous year. Mr. Lundwall says, ""When they sat during `ours' -- listen to me, during `ours,' as though they're not included -- and stood for their modified one, I apologize to nobody for walking out of there.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What follows is a series of inaudible mumbles and gaps in the recording, out of which supposedly emerged the offensive comment by Mr. Ulrich. But the tone is jocular rather than angry. Elsewhere, Mr. Ulrich can be heard reviewing employment records and remarking with satisfaction on the advancement of women and minorities. And in a discussion of how to talk prospective downsizees out the door, Mr. Ulrich comes across rather well -- sensitive yet realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The press might have thrown this evidence onto the scale when weighing whether ""nunjunah"" was really ""nigger.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Calls around Texaco last week didn't find anybody willing to say, on the record or off, what sort of guy Mr. Ulrich was, even though Mr. Bijur and the rest worked side by side with him for years. Their desire to duck this question was not hard to fathom: If Mr. Ulrich were a hardened racist, they should have booted him out long ago. If he were a decent guy, defending him now would violate the first rule of post-Tylenol crisis management, which is never defend yourself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, having scored this slamdunk over various Interfaith Councils for Decrying Big Business, the company blithers that the tapes are still ""troubling."" But Texaco must live in the world, and will certainly cough up generously to settle the lawsuit and become exemplary for its ""diversity"" programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the rest of us, we might conclude that senior executives of Big Oil are honestly at sea over ""diversity"" -- as these tapes clearly reveal -- no less than anyone else is. The muckraking publication Sales & Marketing Management recently pointed out to its readers that ""African-Americans confront stereotypes that make it difficult for them to sell to [white] customers."" Who could doubt it? And yet the same presumably liberal California voters who plumped heavily for Bill Clinton last week also decided that racial preferences are the wrong solution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the honest uncertainty, perhaps we should accept that there is more to human dignity than twisting ourselves into pretzels of ""sensitivity."" And keeping a few old goats around at Texaco who remember when the business of an oil company was finding oil, not color-coding jelly beans, may not be such a bad thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: On the Basis of Merit Only"" -- WSJ Nov. 19, 1996)</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Bush's A-team next year. The same goes for Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters deserve to know who is to be entrusted with the machinery of government. And they should know before Election Day, not after the votes are counted, while the champagne is flowing and when names start cropping up in the news. By then, it's too late to do anything about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are good reasons for demanding that both candidates come clean sooner rather than later.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bush, for instance, staged images of inclusion in Philadelphia and produced a platform that said, ""To all Americans, particularly immigrants and minorities, we send a clear message: This is the party of freedom and progress, and it is your home."" George W. Bush now has a chance to go one step further by revealing to America what his administration would look like.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Would the people selected to help him wield power reflect the hard- right political orientation of the overwhelmingly white conventioneers who were kept offstage at the First Union Center in Philly? Or would he craft an administration that reflects the diversity his party touted in prime time and in its platform?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican standard-bearer can spend the rest of the campaign hugging black children, addressing Latino rallies in fluent Spanish and pledging help to Native Americans. But a Bush governing team that fails to look like the America he professes to embrace would confirm the Democratic charge that the GOP convention was only an illusion of inclusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Waiting until Inauguration Day to find out what Bush has in mind is a gamble. Voters need to know now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Al Gore has no less a burden. A major role reversal has occurred within the Democratic Party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Writing about the Democratic convention in the Aug. 28 New Republic, Franklin Foer correctly observed: ""Liberal lions like Jackson and [Ted] Kennedy may know how to give speeches that energize the base, but the action in the Democratic Party is well to their right, with the Democratic Leadership Council . . . and other hard- core centrists. And the centrists know it; throughout the convention, their triumphalism is palpable.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Rev. Jesse Jackson partially conceded the shift during a meeting with The Post's editorial board this week. He agreed that the privately run Democratic Leadership Council has gained firm control of the top of the Democratic presidential ticket through its chairman, Sen. Joe Lieberman, and its member, Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Jackson said the council's membership does not reflect the racial or political orientation of delegates at the Los Angeles convention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That may not matter. As Will Marshall, president of the council's think tank, the Progressive Policy Institute, boasted in the New Republic piece: ""We used to be outside taking shots [at them]. Now we're enthroned and they're constantly attacking us.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does that mean the center-right-oriented council would have greater influence over the naming of Cabinet members and other top- level positions in a Gore administration? Not an insignificant question.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most African Americans and many other voters of color are expected to go with Gore because of Bill Clinton's record on jobs, his support for civil rights and his appointment of the most diverse administration in this country's history. But now that Gore is his ""own man,"" voters may want to know if the Democratic Leadership Council's ascendancy will mean a rollback in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> or backsliding on Democratic policies aimed at strengthening cities and rural communities and closing the achievement gap in schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candidate Gore can answer their worries by putting on public view- -before Nov. 7--the key women and men with whom he plans to govern.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That said, it would be wrong to conclude that this column's push for early disclosure is only about race and diversity. It's more than that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We're in a new day. Voters are better informed; they want and need to know more. Why shouldn't they know, in advance, who would be on the next president's foreign policy team? Why can't they be in a position to judge--before they vote--the credentials and competence of the individuals who, for example, would be selected to oversee health care policy and food and drug laws, manage environmental protection, carry the burden of federal law-enforcement responsibilities and steer the executive branch through the federal budget process?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both camps will tell you that's what a presidential transition is for--that they have to develop a blueprint, recruit, vet, make people fill out forms, and meet with interest groups, etc. from November to January.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Never mind that Tony Blair and his cabinet ministers took office in England one day after his election--a 24-hour transition. Or that presidential transitions take a week in France.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Okay, I'll concede this much: The next president can't unveil his entire administration by November. But why not disclose his future cabinet by mid-October?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sure, it would spoil the fun of watching the months-long intense jockeying of wannabes seeking top jobs in the next administration. And yes, it would stop Gore and Bush, two political pros, from teasing and extracting support from the ambitious and the aspiring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I think it's time for Bush and Gore to stop showing voters a little leg; it's time for both men to show their hand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e-mail: kingc@washpost.com</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

The searing news of the disproportionate rates of COVID-19 among Black Americans has added to the urgency of this moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But not for Donald Trump. His long record of embracing racism as a political tool -- from his promotion of the ""birther"" lie about Barack Obama to his defense of white supremacists -- has made him the most racially polarizing president in the last century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet while many Republican ""Never Trumpers"" condemn Trump for his brazen appeals to white supremacy, they are curiously silent on Ronald Reagan's record on race and civil rights. It's no accident that the Party of Reagan morphed so easily into the Party of Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long before Trump descended his golden escalator, promising to ""Make America Great Again,"" Reagan was the first to use the slogan ""Let's Make America Great Again,"" vowing to return America to its past glory before the civil rights movement toppled Jim Crow in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whenever the issue of Reagan's hostility to civil rights and unpopularity with Black Americans is broached, conservatives leap to Reagan's defense and stress his apparent lack of personal racism. That view has been shredded by the disclosure last year of a phone call in October 1971 between Richard Nixon and Reagan, in which Reagan described African diplomats as ""monkeys"" who were still ""uncomfortable wearing their shoes.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan's sunny vision of America as a ""shining city"" may be the antithesis of Donald Trump's dystopian American ""carnage,"" he masterfully deployed racially coded language and other dog whistles like ""states' rights,"" ""law and order"" and ""welfare queens"" that resonated with middle-class taxpayers without appearing racist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telling illustration is Reagan's decision to give a major speech in his 1980 campaign at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., only miles from where three civil rights workers -- James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner -- were murdered in 1964. Looking back, it is eerily similar to Trump's decision to hold a campaign rally on the day after Juneteenth in Tulsa, Okla., the site of the worst racial massacre in the 20th century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan was the first presidential nominee of a major political party to attend that fair since it started in 1889, and that fact was not lost on the 20,000 white people gathered there on Aug. 3, 1980, many proudly waving Confederate flags and chanting, ""We want Reagan! We want Reagan!"" The crowd was exhilarated with his declaring his fidelity to states' rights, which for a century had been the South's rallying cry to prevent the federal government from interfering with its racial customs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That speech helped Reagan sweep every Southern state except President Carter's home state of Georgia. Since then, the Old Confederacy has been the heart of the GOP. On the eve of Reagan's inauguration, Black Americans feared an assault on the civil rights gains of the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These fears were well-founded. After all, Reagan began his political career with his 1966 campaign for California governor by denouncing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, while running radio ads referring to urban areas as ""jungles.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only months after the Watts riots, Reagan made ""law and order"" and opposition to California's far-reaching Fair Housing Act the centerpiece of his campaign to oust the liberal incumbent, Pat Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan repeatedly said, ""If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes in the sale or renting of his property, it is his right to do so."" This stance resonated with millions of middle-class white voters, many of whom had never voted for a Republican, but voted for Reagan in part because they feared African Americans moving into their neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan's success in making inroads with white working-class voters in the booming suburbs of Southern California was a template for the ""law and order"" and ""silent majority"" rhetoric that fueled Nixon's presidential victory in 1968. Reagan mounted an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination in 1968, in which he crisscrossed the South and white enclaves across the country thrilling conservative audiences with his scorching attacks on lawless civil rights agitators and his tough talk of law and order. Just hours after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, Reagan called King's assassination ""a great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order and people started choosing which laws they'd break.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1976, Reagan, in challenging Gerald Ford for the Republican presidential nomination, popularized the racist trope of a ""welfare queen,"" repeating at virtually every campaign stop, before white audiences, the fictitious story of a Black welfare cheat, subsidized by hardworking white taxpayers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, Reagan's two-term presidency marked a new nadir in race relations. His administration tried to dilute the Voting Rights Act, vitiated the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and vowed to abolish <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, arguing that white men were the only victims -- of reverse discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan's attitudes on civil rights were reflected in his refusal to impose sanctions on the apartheid government of South Africa; he vetoed a 1986 bill imposing sanctions, which Congress overrode. Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu was so incensed that he declared Reagan ""a racist, pure and simple.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most egregiously, Reagan was instrumental in ratcheting up the ""war on drugs,"" which has led to the mass incarceration of Black and poor people of color and the destruction of families and communities. His administration adopted a series of draconian laws that resulted in the imprisonment rate of African Americans on drug charges that is almost six times that of whites, even though whites use illicit drugs at a similar rate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan eschewed the overt racism of Trump, his racial politics paved the way for Trump. In fact, Reagan's brand of racism was perhaps more sinister than Trump's because he did it with a genial smile. In reckoning with Trump, we need to reckon with Reagan's legacy. And that began with his appeal to white voters in Southern California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: RONALD REAGAN, at the 1976 GOP National Convention, repeatedly used the trope of the Black ""welfare queen"" to appeal to white voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:David Hume Kennerly Getty Images</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Daniel S.

Make him talk seriously about his judicial philosophy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court seat that has been vacant since the death more than a year ago of Justice Antonin Scalia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cynical conventional wisdom is that Republicans will lob softballs at the nominee, Democrats will try to portray his decisions on the federal appeals court in Denver as hostile to ""the little guy,"" and the judge himself will say as little as possible about controversial legal questions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We'd like to suggest a different approach: Senators should engage the nominee in a serious discussion of his views about the Constitution, the role of precedent and how the court should adapt general principles to changing social and scientific circumstances. And Gorsuch should respond in kind by speaking as frankly as he can, demurring only about specific cases that are likely to come before him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, Democrats are justifiably angry that the Republican majority never allowed hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland, President Obama's eminently qualified nominee to replace Scalia. One consequence of that power play is that Democratic senators are under extreme pressure from their liberal base to oppose Gorsuch. Beyond that, they have legitimate concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, from gay and transgender rights to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and reproductive rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are free to remind their Republican colleagues -- and Gorsuch -- of the injustice done to Obama and Garland. They also have every right to question the nominee about his rulings on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and his previous work, such as the role he played as a Justice Department lawyer in defending the George W. Bush administration's policies on interrogating and detaining suspected terrorists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the main focus should be how Gorsuch would approach the role of a Supreme Court justice. Gorsuch is only 49; if confirmed, he could sit on the court for decades and outlast several presidents and Congresses. In particular, they should explore how Gorsuch would interpret the Constitution and, to a lesser extent, acts of Congress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like Scalia, Gorsuch has been described as an ""originalist,"" someone who interprets the Constitution according to the meaning its provisions had at the time they were adopted. In a speech at Case Western Reserve University Law School last year, Gorsuch said judges should strive to ""apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This formula is much less straightforward than it seems. For one thing, ""text"" and ""history"" can be at odds because language can have different connotations at different times. For example, to Americans in the 19th century, the ""equal protection of the laws"" guaranteed by the 14th Amendment might seem to protect only racial equality; in the 20th century it seemed obvious to many Americans that it also prohibited some forms of sexual discrimination. Does Gorsuch object to that updated interpretation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he believe that a constitutional provision must be viewed through the eyes of the generation in which it was adopted and can't be interpreted to deal with situations its authors couldn't have imagined, such as cellphone signals being used to track suspects without a warrant? The U.S. Constitution has never been that sort of rigid document.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scalia, for whom Gorsuch has expressed great admiration, was zealous in defending relatively specific rights mentioned in the Constitution, including freedom of speech and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures -- even in circumstances that the Constitution's framers couldn't have anticipated, such as the sale of video games or the use by police of GPS technology. But Scalia's version of originalism led to him dissent stridently from rulings recognizing rights, such as abortion or marriage equality for gays and lesbians, that his colleagues rightly read into more general language in the Constitution about ""liberty"" and ""equal protection of the laws.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those decisions were a natural outgrowth of earlier rulings in which the court secured other rights that the Constitution didn't explicitly guarantee, such as a right to marry someone of another race (or the right to marry at all) or the right to use contraceptives in the privacy of one's bedroom. An America in which those decisions had come out the other way would not be an America in which most of us would want to live.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators should ask Gorsuch whether he shares Scalia's disdain for the court's decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage and, if so, whether he would nevertheless accord those decisions respect as precedents of the court. It's entirely possible that Gorsuch would not have joined the decisions legalizing abortion or same-sex marriage but also wouldn't agitate to overturn those rulings if he joined the court. Gorsuch reportedly told Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that he didn't believe a long-established precedent should be overruled simply because five current justices think it was wrongly decided. That's a possibility the committee should look into, but as part of a broader inquiry into Gorsuch's view of the importance of precedent and predictability in the law. (Some precedents, after all, should be overturned -- witness Plessy vs. Ferguson, the 1896 ruling that approved segregation in public facilities.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if Gorsuch wouldn't upset existing precedents, he could make it harder for the court to adapt to future changes in American society if he took too constrained an ""originalist"" approach going forward. That's why it's important that senators engage him in a dialogue about his view of the court's role that goes beyond hot-button issues such as abortion, guns and gay rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gorsuch is obviously an accomplished jurist. He has been rated ""well qualified"" by the American Bar Assn. (as was Garland, who never was permitted to appear before the Judiciary Committee). Unlike some Trump appointees, he is neither a crony nor someone whose professional credentials can be questioned. But the Senate has a right to look beyond a sterling resume to inquire about the philosophy that will help shape the court for decades to come.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

The lessons here are instructive. The ballot measure claimed to end “preferential treatment” in state schools. It resulted in a 25% reduction in Black student enrollment at state colleges and universities — the largest decline among all groups. Two decades later, UC’s Black enrollment is about 5%; it was slightly more than 7% pre-Prop. 209.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the executive director of Black College Success — a community-based nonprofit that provides academic pathways to colleges and universities for hundreds of Black students in South Los Angeles — I’m forced to reckon with the difficulty of improving such statistics. You should know that 75% of Black students from the Los Angeles Unified School District don’t enroll in and 85% don’t graduate from a four-year college or university. They come from communities where the median family income is less than $48,000 a year, and where less than 10% of community members have a college degree.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite these terrible odds, in May, the Black College Success team celebrated the admission of 208 students to more than 40 colleges and universities, including prestigious institutions such as Stanford, Pepperdine, Pitzer, Tulane and New York University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was far from easy for these students. For instance, Jackson, 18 and headed to a competitive school in the northeast, grew up in a single-parent household with a hardworking father who drives for Amazon, faced the challenges of being a Black man in L.A., avoiding gang life and supporting his siblings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ajaa, 17, will be a freshman at an HBCU — a historically Black college or university — in Georgia. She won more than $100,000 in scholarships while working part time to support her family, including take care of her younger brother so that her mother could attend school too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We’re not only trying to shatter the boundaries Black students from South Los Angeles face in gaining access to college, but to also help make clear the transformative opportunity that college offers their families financially for the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the students we work with will be the first in their families to go to college. And our help doesn’t stop there. To get them to graduation (our first cohort hasn’t yet reached that milestone), we follow them wherever they enroll, with continued counseling about class choices and majors and career possibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, how do we do it? And how will we do it in a post-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> world?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There’s just one way: one student at a time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the work of finding and recruiting high schoolers for the program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning as early as sophomore year (as we continue to expand, we’ll eventually work with students starting the moment they enter high school), a team of “college access managers,” who are from the same neighborhoods as our students and have backgrounds in college recruitment, go into our partner high schools, which have expressed an interest in working with us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The managers figuratively and literally meet the students where they are and offer them an array of supports, starting with academic planning assistance for their A-G requirements, the classes students must complete with a grade of C or better to be eligible to enter the Cal State or UC systems. No matter where students apply, the A-G standards are an objective demonstration that they’re college ready.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At times, the students’ need for mentoring is far greater than our capacity, so we partner with in-school resources, such as the newly created Black Student Achievement Program, and lock arms with other nonprofits like Brotherhood Crusade, 826LA, Los Angeles Urban League and others that can help us provide writing workshops, access to advanced courses and a range of extracurricular activities, stipends for summer internships, career guidance and scholarships.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once our students become seniors, they receive one-on-one college application assistance, personal statement workshops and financial aid advice. We take them on college and university visits and help them evaluate their choices. Our aim is to provide them with everything they need to level the landscape against peers who often enjoy significant advantages, such as private tutors and schools with more funding and resources than those in South L.A.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In doing this work, I’ve learned that it’s not how high a student’s GPA is or how impressive their test scores are that gets results. It’s an all-of-the-above mix of academics, guidance and the students’ own determination — the ability of a Jackson or an Ajaa to persevere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I’ve seen stories like theirs by the dozens. My fear is that, in the unfortunate new world of colorblind admissions, the opportunities available to them will diminish. If colleges and universities look past the distinctive experiences of Black applicants, it’s not just the students who will lose, but society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ibert Schultz is the executive director of Black College Success, a project of the LA Promise Fund.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports	
6574bd9b9b3c601d1c28500f	aa_opeds_sample/txt/408321836.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Power Ignored by the Press</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thirty years ago there was a flurry of interest by the press in the activities of America's nonprofit, tax-exempt foundations. Some, we discovered, acted as conduits for CIA subsidies to civic and educational organizations and subsidized the publication of various books and magazines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was all part of the Cold War against the Soviet Union, although many recipients of the agency's cash didn't know that and didn't know their patron. Not much came from these disclosures. The parties promised to sin no more and before long, the affair had faded into the misty regions of memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media turned to other pursuits and today, as Nicholas Lemann writes in the Atlantic Monthly, ""The press, which pays close attention to politics and government through deeply ingrained reflex, largely ignores foundations, or treats them, in a polite but faintly bored tone, as innocuous do-gooders rather than significant actors.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our interest in these institutions flickered briefly a couple of years ago when conservative elements in Congress started asking questions and proposing legislation to curb the political activities of foundations and the thousands of tax-exempt special interest groups that have spread like kudzu during the past 25 years. They now occupy a respectable share of the available office space in Washington. The ""public interests"" they represent range from the World Association of Alcohol Beverage Industries and the Dairy Recognition Foundation to the League of Women Voters and the YMCA.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax exemption, as Lemann reminds us, is granted to foundations and their ""public interest"" cousins on condition that they forswear any ""attempt to influence political or legislative outcomes, except by providing technical information. This rule is violated widely. In fact, it's difficult to think of a significant policy initiative taken by the federal government or voiced in a recent presidential campaign that didn't have some foundation undergirding.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is complicated by the federal government, which provides funding to many politically active nonprofits -- the National Council of Senior Citizens, for example -- that administer various federal educational and job-training programs. Republican critics in Congress claim that through bookkeeping devices these federal grants can be misused to finance political activities. They lost the fight last year, and the subject has more or less vanished from media agendas. That is unfortunate because foundations and the ""public interest"" nonprofits are a big, influential and expanding industry. Lemann reports that during the past 15 years or so the number of foundations has nearly doubled, from 22,000 to 39,000. Their assets now exceed $200 billion, half of it controlled by fewer than 200 foundations, according to another student of the industry, Alan Reynolds of the Hudson Institute.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This wealth, he writes, represents ""enormous influence over which public policy, social program or artistic endeavor will succeed or fail."" Lemann makes a similar point. Big foundations, ""which have a distinctly liberal cast use their tax-exempt dollars to fund everything from the civil rights movement to studies supporting the expansion of the welfare state to disarmament and population control abroad."" As conservative foundations have prospered since 1980 they ""have been particularly successful in training cadres of activists and policymakers to serve their cause, by subsidizing books that change the tenor of public discourse (for example, Dinesh D'Souza's `Illiberal Education') and supplying the government with policy ideas (the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for the early Reagan Administration . . . ).""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reach of the foundations is felt in ostensibly private affairs as well. Peter Skerry, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, recalls in the Wilson Quarterly the 1994 upheaval within the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The incumbent executive director, Benjamin Chavis, was ousted. ""But it was seldom noted {in the press},"" Skerry observes, ""that his removal was instigated not by the membership but by the Ford Foundation, which withheld a major grant until the NAACP's finances were put in order. One of the few observers who did note it was Washington Post columnist William Raspberry {who asked} . . . how such a venerable organization, still 600,000 members strong, has come to the point . . . of being beholden to a private foundation for its survival?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foundations may even work through relatively hollow organizational fronts. Skerry cites the case of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) ""which seeks to represent not only all Mexican Americans but all of the nation's 27 million Latinos. This claim is widely accepted, and the organization has played a prominent role in recent debates over immigration and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Yet it has no members and gets most of its funding from corporations and foundations, especially the Ford Foundation, which played the critical role in establishing it in the late 1960s. Lacking members, MALDEF has no real bonds of accountability to the communities it strives to represent.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Kettering Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia foundation, are less well-known than the Ford or Rockefeller foundations. But they have had a significant impact on a number of nongovernmental institutions, including the American press. Their intellectual leadership and money have been largely responsible for the ""civic journalism"" movement that has been taken up by the media in more than 40 cities. The guiding principle of ""civic journalism"" is that the public, through polls and ""focus groups"" usually financed by the foundations, should play an important role in setting the news and editorial agendas of the press. Newspapers and broadcasters that have embraced the movement are generally pleased with the results.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many critics such as William Woo, former editor of the St. Louis Post Dispatch, believe the press risks its independence and credibility by aligning itself and becoming financially beholden to foundations with ""a very ideological view of America, a very definite view of the road America should take."" He puts Pew in that category.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Lemann, the broader problem is that foundations ""have no voters, no customers, no investors."" So they operate in an unexamined environment, ignored by the press and public alike. No one asks the ""main policy questions about them -- How, exactly, should their economic and political activities be restricted in return for their tax-exempt status? Does the tax exemption still make sense ?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This {isolation} ought to change. Foundations are becoming so much more significant so rapidly that they deserve to be brought into the company of central institutions whose course is the subject of constant public scrutiny and debate.""</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed		
6574bd9b9b3c601d1c28500f	aa_opeds_sample/txt/432415722.xml.txt	"<div><p>Fixing the Race Gap in 25 Years or Less</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE Supreme Court decision upholding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in university admissions seemed to carry an expiration date. ''We expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her 5-to-4 majority opinion last week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the justices have in the past said that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> should not be used forever, never before has a justice placed a specific time limit on it. Having now done so, Justice O'Connor has raised tough questions, both broad and specific.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are her views merely idle musings, or will they become an iron-clad legal principle? Should the goal be parity in graduation rates of white, black and Hispanic high school students? Or should it be equality in financing between poor school districts, which tend to have more minority students, and middle-class white ones? Can the gap between black and white students on the SAT be bridged in the next generation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In The Chicago Tribune, Justice O'Connor said in a rare interview that the country can tackle many of these challenges. ''I hope it looks as though we don't need artificial help to fill our classrooms with highly qualified students at the graduate level,'' she said. ''And if we do our job on educating young people, we can reach that goal.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But closing the disparities in educational achievement and opportunities for college applicants across racial and ethnic lines will involve vociferous debate over the relative importance of school financing, social inequality and student study habits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Statistics tell the story. On every major indicator of academic success -- the SAT, the A.C.T. and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (given to elementary and secondary students) -- the gap between white and minority students has persisted for decades. Though it narrowed somewhat on the national assessment exams from the 1980's through the early 90's, the divide has only widened since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''There is some serious heavy lifting to do before we get to the dream scenario Justice O'Connor is envisioning,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and an assistant secretary of education in the Reagan administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some liberals say the gap can be closed only by equalizing the amount of money spent on educating whites and minorities. The school districts that many blacks and Hispanics attend spend $902 less per student on average than mostly white districts, according to a national study conducted last year by the Education Trust, a group focused on closing the achievement gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some degree, federal and state governments can, and do, try to fix this imbalance by sending more money to schools serving poor -- and, by extension, disproportionately minority -- students. Federal assistance for poor students is increasing, and state governments gave an average of $27 more per pupil to disproportionately minority schools in 2000 than to predominately white schools, though that hardly had a perceptible impact on the financing gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if federal and state lawmakers were bent on eliminating the financial discrepancies between white and minority districts, they couldn't have much affect. On average, states and the federal government have never accounted for more than 56 percent of schools' revenues over the last decade or so; the remainder has come from local sources, mostly property taxes. This financial structure makes parity unlikely at best.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And conservatives argue that the focus on financial parity misses the point, and point to some minority-dominated city school districts that have high spending per student but still lag well behind less flush districts, particularly in rural areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, educational parity may be linked to bigger, more complex economic factors. Most beneficiaries of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> are middle-income. According to a study by Anthony Carnevale, vice president of the Educational Testing Service, 74 percent of students at the 146 most prestigious colleges and universities -- where competition for admissions is most intense and where <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is practiced -- come from families in the top 25 percent of the nation's socioeconomic scale (as measured by income, educational attainment and occupations of the parents). Only 3 percent of the students at these highly selective schools come from the bottom 25 percent of the socioeconomic scale. As Lani Guinier, a law professor at Harvard University, puts it, ''<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is less an escalator up than it is a bridge across.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even middle-class black and Hispanic children who are burdened with issues of crime, troubled homes and poor schools have not been able to close the test-score gap with their white counterparts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The gap persists across all income levels,'' said Freeman Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, who has written extensively on improving the academic achievement of black students. ''We're talking about generations of habits in too many homes,'' said Mr. Hrabowski, who is black. ''Unfortunately, reading is not the No. 1 priority as a habit. There is much more emphasis on television watching.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both sides on the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> issue agree on the need to close the education gap, but not much else. Some supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hope that Justice O'Connor's 25-year time frame will protect <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> while the country makes headway in closing that rift.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the decision last week does not invalidate laws in California and Washington State that ban the use of race in public university admissions, hiring and government contracting. Ward Connerly, the black California businessman who was the force behind passing those laws, has already vowed to make Michigan his next target.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demographic pressures will also come into play. The Educational Testing Service estimates that from 1995 to 2015, the percentage of whites on college campuses will decline from 71 percent to 63 percent, while Hispanics will increase to 15 percent, from the current 11 percent, with blacks holding steady at 13 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with minorities making up a larger proportion of students going to college -- and with the children of young immigrants approaching college age toward the end of Justice O'Connor's 25-year target -- Hispanic and black parents may be clamoring even more forcefully that their children not be shut out of top schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the debate has not changed. Opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> will continue to say that such programs keep the country from focusing on what needs to be done -- namely, helping minority students meet higher standards. The supporters of race preferences counter that the country cannot end <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> without first fixing the education system. All agree that unless a commitment is made -- by society and minority families themselves -- the old arguments will still be around in 25 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lisa Navarette, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said, ''If all we do over the 25 years is <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, then we will still need <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, 1964: The University of Michigan Law School yearbook reflects the times.

6574bd9b9b3c601d1c28500f	test_question_neutral_testing_1	<p>Talking About Race in Akron</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid discussions about race are difficult even in intimate settings among well-acquainted people. For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>	stance:::Neutral			
6574bd9b9b3c601d1c28500f	aa_opeds_sample/txt/434126284.xml.txt	"<div><p>Meet The New Elite, Not Like The Old</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- They are the children of 1969 -- the year that America's most prestigious universities began aggressively recruiting blacks and Latinos to their nearly all-white campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No longer would Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Columbia be the domain of the privileged. Instead, in response to the national soul-searching prompted by the civil rights movement, America's premier colleges would try to become more representative of the population as a whole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Forty years later, America is being led, to a striking extent, by a new elite, a cohort of the best and the brightest whose advancement was formed, at least in part, by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies. From Barack and Michelle Obama (Columbia, Princeton, Harvard) to Eric Holder (Columbia) to Sonia Sotomayor (Princeton, Yale) to Valerie Jarrett (Michigan, Stanford),  the country  is now seeing, in full flower, the fruition of this wooing of  minorities to institutions that for much of the nation's history have groomed America's leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet the consequences of that change remain unresolved, as became  clear on Friday, when Mr. Obama grappled a second time with the arrest of the Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his own home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The incident, the president said, offered the potential to soothe  longstanding distrust between minorities and police officers. But it also laid bare another reality, that the children of 1969, even those who now occupy niches at the top of society, regard their status as complicated, ambiguous and vulnerable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Whether I were black or white, I think that me commenting on this and hopefully contributing to constructive -- as opposed to negative -- understandings about the issue, is part of my portfolio,"" Mr. Obama said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a reminder that Mr. Obama, in addition to being the most powerful American, is also the fulfillment of the ideals embraced by Ivy League minority recruiters in 1969. Mr. Gates entered Yale that year, as one of 96 black freshmen. Today that number seems small. But there had been only six black students just three years before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gates belonged to the first <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> wave at top universities -- a wave that continued into the 1970s and the 1980s. I was one of its beneficiaries. A black 17-year-old from Monrovia, Liberia, I was one of some 200 black freshmen at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1983.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My first roommate was a white student from Seagrove, N.C., whose SAT scores and grade-point average were higher than mine. Privately, I consoled myself that I had qualifications that she didn't: I could name the capital of every country in Africa; countries she had never heard of. I knew where the Zambezi River emptied into the Indian Ocean. None of that had been on the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every now and then I feared I was faking it, that my white classmates had something I didn't. There were things they seemed to know instinctively, that I had to look up. I remember  getting laughed at during a game of Pictionary when I couldn't come up with the word for a giant bird landing on a lawn with a baby in its mouth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My feelings of inadequacy were not unusual, said David L. Evans, the Saturn/Apollo electrical engineer hired by Harvard in 1969 to help lead its <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program. When Mr. Evans visited public high schools in Arkansas in search of promising black students, he was met with skepticism. ""Even people who didn't have any mean-spiritedness would say to the students, 'You going to be up there with the Kennedys?' "" he recalled. "" 'How do you think you can make it there?' ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was  anxiety, too, among  the originators of race-based <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs. ""The idealistic version of why these universities embraced racial <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is that they said, 'Hey, we're in the business of training elites, it would be better for America if there were a diverse elite,' "" said Nicholas Lemann,  dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and  author of ""The Big Test,"" a history of the SAT and the rise of America's meritocracy. To its architects, the minority recruitment was the next phase for universities that for years had paved the way for whites, particularly the offspring of upper-class alumni, Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The cynical version of why they did this is they said, 'We can't control this country, it's becoming too diverse, we need to socialize the brighter minorities and make them more like us.' ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, being molded into people ""more like us"" gave the children of 1969 an advantage denied most of their white counterparts. They learned to navigate within a second world. They also absorbed some of its ideas and values. And they paved the way for the next generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""We had to go through this phase of larger integration for Barack Obama to be possible,"" Mr. Gates said in an interview a few days  after his arrest. ""It would have been impossible for Barack Obama to go from a historic black school to become president, at this time. The whole point is that a broad swath of America had to be able to identify with him.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also enabled Mr. Obama to run ""the most race-blind campaign"" of any black presidential candidate, said Gwen Ifill, the PBS news reporter whose book ""The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama"" examines the rise of African-Americans in politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps. But the children of 1969 dwell in a complex world. They retain  an ethnic identity that includes its own complement of cultural, historical and psychological issues and considerations. This emerged at Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearings. And it emerged again last week, when Mr. Obama joked in the White House East Room that if he ran afoul of the police, ""I'd get shot."" In saying this, he seemed to draw on the fears of black men across the United States, including those within the new power elite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Mr. Obama seemed to be demonstrating was what Mr. Lemann of Columbia calls a ""double consciousness"" that allows the children of 1969 to flow more easily between the world which their skin color bequeathed them and the world which their college degree opened up for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same double consciousness I acquired at U.N.C., though I didn't think about it that way as a student. Sure, my white friends were learning a little more about black (and African) culture from me. But I was absorbing much more from them, since they surrounded me in such great number. At the time it seemed I had the advantage;   I would leave college having gotten much more from my interactions with my white friends than they could possibly have gotten from me. And the principal thing I learned was how to make them feel at ease around me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, of course, on those occasions when one can't. Life outside the university doesn't duplicate the conditions of university life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I can't wear my Harvard gown everywhere I go,"" Professor Gates said. ""We -- all of us in the crossover generation -- have multiple identities, and being black trumps all of those other identities.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday Mr. Obama said he hoped Mr. Gates's incident might become a ""teachable moment."" It is a daunting task for the children of 1969: finding out whether the double consciousness they honed in the Ivy League can actually get this country to listen -- and react -- to race in a different way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HELENE COOPER           Helene Cooper, a White House correspondent for The Times, is the author of ""The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Princeton: Sonia Sotomayor.

Few experts in the press or academe wanted to probe this most politically incorrect topic until Louisiana's David Duke seized the issue and became a political force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>General population polls conducted by Gordon Black Associates in 1984 and by the National Opinion Research Center in 1990 suggest that 1-in-10 white men has been injured by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. This figure alone adds up to millions. Circumstantial evidence suggests even larger numbers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Preferential policies were instituted during an intensely competitive era when huge cohorts of baby boomers crowded job markets increasingly constrained by international competition, lean-and-mean downsizing movements, and tax revolts. Thus, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> often occurred in zero-sum contexts; someone was quota-ed in at another's expense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My research indicates that reverse discrimination's bite has varied by age, geography, occupation, and private or public sector. Most vulnerable have been public-sector white men under the age of 45 with people-oriented skills. Their phone calls flood radio talk-show programs on this topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many more white men may not have been fully aware that they were being injured by behind-the-scenes tactics such as ""race-norming"" of employment tests by public testing agencies, and many private ones. (The EEOC only recently stopped pressuring corporations to use such procedures.) Nor have they been told of the drive to tie managers' bonuses to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hiring and promotion records.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I became curious about the impact of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> while working in the increasingly quota-crazy higher education systems of California -- where policies moved far beyond the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke dictum that race could be considered as one of several factors in selection processes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the 1980s, a state mandate for the community college system (AB1725) ordered a 30% minority-faculty hiring ""goal"" until the year 2005 -- when faculty must mirror the ethnic diversity of the entire state; the University of California began advertising ""targets of diversity"" faculty positions and substantially boosted minority-female representation in administrative staff positions to 72%; and the California State University system implemented set-aside faculty positions, set-aside grant and fellowship programs for graduate students -- while the politically correct faculty union lobbied (successfully) for higher pay for ""underrepresented"" junior faculty. And ""parity goals"" for the entire state work force were monitored in annual reports by the State Personnel Board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As my quiet interest in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> leaked out -- a professionally dangerous development -- students, colleagues, friends and relative strangers began to report encounters with reverse discrimination. In 1984-85, two graduate assistants and I supplemented this rising tide of informal data -- and scattered press reports -- with 32 in-depth interviews with California-based, mostly middle-class white men who reported that preferential policies prevented them from obtaining jobs or disrupted or ended extant careers. Some findings:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A community college instructor repeatedly lost tenure-track appointments to less qualified minorities after he moved to California from Michigan.

(He finally obtained an appointment at another college.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A mid-management bank administrator -- and an ardent liberal -- began to have second thoughts as he watched women he'd hired the year before move by him on the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> fast-track. (Rapid increases in female mid-management employees in his bank and at others lent credence to his account.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Public-sector workers reported that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> barriers eventually became obvious and quietly acknowledged by most employees. After 13 years of being bypassed by minorities or women, one upper-middle-management California state official reported being offered a promotion -- with some public fanfare -- only to have the appointment rescinded because, as an agency head told him, ""Let's face it, you're not the right color.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of these men avoided open complaints or protests out of fear they wouldn't be believed or would be labeled racist. (No one said he feared being thought sexist.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Six resigned from the organizations that discriminated against them. Three circumvented reverse discrimination problems through various organizational means. Three filed suits, none of which was successful. No government agency offered redress. (EEOC guidelines effectively insulate employers from reverse discrimination complaints if the employer has taken ""reasonable"" voluntary <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> to remedy ""deficiencies"" in minority representation.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of our subjects simply acquiesced in their treatment with varying degrees of bewilderment, resignation or anger. Most subjects voiced temporary, if not long-term, frustration and cynicism about social institutions. ""A lot of us were sold a bill of goods,"" complained a California state middle-management worker. ""We were told if you went to college you could write your own ticket. But . . . <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has lowered standards to the point where education counts against you.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No subject expressed hostility toward minorities per se, but many felt alienated from a society that refused to acknowledge whites' victimization. A teacher, transferred to a distant school in a racial balancing plan, commented: ""My friends couldn't handle this. They experienced cognitive dissonance. They didn't want to be seen as racists."" Another teacher noted: ""I found out what it was like to be a victim. Nobody likes a victim.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Research sponsored and then suppressed by the Democratic Party in 1985 and 1987 suggests a possible class split in white reactions to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Political analyst Stanley Greenberg's ""Report on Democratic Defections"" by blue-collar white ""Reagan Democrats"" in Michigan found fury over quotas for blacks and immigrants. (This anger, Mr. Greenberg concluded, undercut Democratic campaign themes of ""fairness"" and ""justice."") These data, in combination with the record of lawsuits filed by blue-collar groups (overtly or covertly aided by unions), indicate a more militant, angry working-class response. This is perhaps because of more intense zero-sum problems wrought by a shrinking blue-collar jobs market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until Pete Wilson, Jesse Helms and David Duke began to attack quotas in statewide election campaigns last year, a curious bipartisan paralysis thwarted any open political response to rank-and-file whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Radicals and liberals have neutralized whites' complaints with swift, categorical denials, such as ""white males can't be victims."" Indeed, much liberal and multicultural theory today embodies a colorized version of Marx's class struggle. White men (regardless of individual backgrounds) are regarded as a privileged modern-day ""bourgeoisie,"" while women and people of color (again, regardless of individual or subgroup circumstances) are the oppressed ""proletariat."" Any mention of a white working class -- once prominently represented in labor histories -- is simply met with more rationalizations or with awkward silence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives have been inclined to dismiss white men's complaints of reverse discrimination because of conservatism's rugged individualistic and free-market underpinnings. White men injured by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> are likely to be told to ""take it like a man"" and get on with their lives. Conservatives are also likely to harbor the assumption that an injured white man can simply quit the offending organization and get another job or start his own business. And there's been more than a hint of class bias. Conservatives are not overly fond of historically Democratic, unionized, white, blue-collar and public-sector workers. Some right-of-center writers have sneered at ""firefighters"" (presumably racist brethren of Archie Bunker) who complain of reverse discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stereotype of ""racist"" working-class white men has made most journalists, academics and politicians fearful of acquiring a ""racist"" label themselves if they even raise the white-male problem. Thus, most of the recent debate over <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has focused on the safer topics of costs to employers and the stigmatization of officially favored groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unwanted, inadvertent findings about whites and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have been buried. Just as the Greenberg studies were suppressed in the mid-1980s, a 1990 study by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, designed to provide impetus for the 1991 civil rights bill, was bottled up. News leaks indicated the study uncovered substantial white anger toward <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One study not buried was the recent, well-publicized Urban Institute study in which matched black/white pairs of job seekers were sent out to test discrimination in hiring. In 67% of the outcomes, neither applicant was offered a job; in 13%, both the black and white applicants were offered the job; in 15% of the cases, only the white applicant was offered the job, while in 5% of the cases the black received the offer-indicating only minimal levels of reverse discrimination. However, the institute study ignored the public sector entirely, as well as people-oriented, liberal-arts types of jobs. Would the institute be willing to dispatch black/white teams to apply for openings in California state agencies? In universities?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span>'s impact upon white males must also be viewed as a legitimate topic of discussion if we are to understand how these policies have both functioned and malfunctioned. An earlier, fair hearing of whites' complaints might have led to the recognition that, in practice, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has become what George Will has aptly termed a racial spoils system with all attendant corruptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lingering white racism is to be condemned. But it is unjust and inaccurate to automatically attribute whites' criticisms of flawed policies to racism. Further suppression will only obscure troubling realities and lead to emotional exploitation of an important topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lynch is visiting associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California, and author of ""Invisible Victims: White Males and the Crisis of Affirmative Action"" (Praeger Paperbacks, 1991).</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

They then invoked an obscure Senate rule that required the judicial candidates to be re-nominated. (Yes, these are the same Republicans who used to loudly demand that every one of President George W. Bush's nominees get a vote on the Senate floor, regardless of their qualifications.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most prominent of the five repeaters is Goodwin Liu, a law professor and legal scholar who would be the only Asian-American serving as an active judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Liu went to Stanford, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and graduated from Yale Law School. He clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before beginning a teaching career at the University of California, Berkeley,  School of Law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, it is largely his stellar background that is fueling Republican opposition. Mr. Liu, who is 39, is seen as a strong possibility to be on President Obama's short list for a future Supreme Court vacancy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives do not like Mr. Liu's support for same-sex marriage rights, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and his view that the Constitution is a living document that evolves over time. But his views fall well within the legal and political mainstream. His warnings that Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel Alito would turn out to be extremely conservative were accurate. But Mr. Liu is no rigid liberal ideologue, as his support of school vouchers and charter schools attest. Kenneth Starr, the conservative lawyer who investigated President Bill Clinton, co-signed a letter vouching for Mr. Liu's ""independence and openness to diverse viewpoints.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be nice if some Republican members of the Judiciary Committee voted for Mr. Liu and the four other re-nominees (along with three other new nominees). Whether they do or not, the White House and Senate Democrats should persist in fighting for their confirmation and the confirmation of the 16 other pending nominees already approved by the committee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the comparable point in the Bush presidency, the Senate had confirmed 61.4 percent of Mr. Bush's nominees.

A few students -- we won't pretend to know how many -- have been plotting a swell trick to lampoon the sometimes wretched excesses of political correctness on campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As far as that goes, who can complain? American academia wears no single ideological facepaint. But in the aggregate, the thinking of the professoriate (and often the earnest studentoriate, too) can self-censor dangerous thoughts. These thoughts include any suggestion that individuals or groups deserve to be critiqued let alone -- heaven forfend! -- criticized. So unless the group in question holds authority, or wealth, or is otherwise by definition oppressive, even honest critiques or criticisms tend to be unwelcome. Judgment can be, you know, so judgmental.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if your worldview is more impish than that, how best to make fun of the people, the cultural values, that others hold so sacrosanct?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One whispered proposal at Columbia is an ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale,"" at which white or Asian students would be charged markedly more for pastries than Latino or African-American or Native- American customers. The point is to confront the college community with the purported silliness of discriminating -- favorably and unfavorably -- on the basis of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not irreverent enough for you? How about a rollicking game of ""Catch an Illegal Immigrant""? Players compete for a bounty by trying to corral a student who dresses up as, say, a Guatemalan border- runner. (Extra yuks if the ""illegal"" pours water down his back, thus rendering it wet. What a hoot!)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Don't think ill of Columbia. Peruse news databases and you'll find similar antics at elite universities by the dozen. Columbia's students are distinguished by restraint: They'd be late to this party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ours being a free country, there's nothing illegal about insulting groups of people in ways that some individuals in those groups might find hurtful. But noted wit Don Imus has done all of us a courtesy by letting us see the pain that a moment of hilarity can cause others. The young women from Rutgers University had the perfect response to Imus' game. They wouldn't play.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ignoring obnoxiousness is such a marvelous retort that it's remarkable how rarely most of us do that. The typical campus reaction to bake sales and immigrant games is to form committees, and draft policies, and pronounce prohibitions -- exercises in correctness that, yes, only betray an overweening fealty to correctness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So if spring frolics bring a clever bake sale or border game to a campus near you, let it be. And try to imagine how Don Imus felt when he realized how his momentary fun had wounded some college kids who aren't as fortunate as he.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
5c037f464c14cf00019d379f	test_question_against_testing_1	<p>TESTING THE WATERS DROPPING THE SAT WOULD MEAN FAILING STUDENTS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Got a weight problem? Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>	stance:::Neutral

Now the guy in the back of the class is shooting spitballs at the class pet and is coming off as more juvenile than daring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Around the McCain campaign, they grouse that Obama ""hasn't bled."" He hasn't bled literally, in military service, just like W., the last holder of an E-ZPass who sped past McCain. And he hasn't paid his dues in the Senate, since he basically just stopped by for directions to the Oval Office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a new senator, Obama was not only precocious enough to pounce on turf that McCain had invested years in, such as campaign finance lobbying, ethics reform and earmarks. When Obama did reach across the aisle for a mentor, it was to the staid Richard Lugar of Indiana, not to the salty Republican of choice for Democrats, McCain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the Illinois freshman took back a private promise to join McCain's campaign finance reform effort, McCain told his aide Mark Salter to ""brush him back."" Salter sent an over-the-top vituperative letter to Obama. ""I guess I beaned him instead,"" Salter told Newsweek's Howard Fineman.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain could dismiss W. as a lightweight, but he knows Obama's smart.

Indeed, there hardly is a regular legislative process anymore; controversial measures are increasingly embodied in riders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for me the most vicious example of the corrupted process was the Senate's 54-to-45 vote last month to reject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White of the Missouri Supreme Court to a federal district judgeship. Every one of the 55 Republican senators except one who was absent voted against Justice White. They all did so at the urging of their ultra-conservative colleague John Ashcroft of Missouri.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Ashcroft charged that Justice White was ''pro-criminal,'' had ''a serious bias against the death penalty'' and showed ''a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' As first demonstrated in a column by Benjamin Wittes of The Washington Post, those statements were lies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In support of his charge that Justice White is biased against the death penalty, Senator Ashcroft cited the case of a black defendant, Brian Kinder, sentenced to death for murder. When the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, Justice White dissented. Senator Ashcroft said the basis for the dissent was that the trial judge, Earl Blackwell, had said he ''opposed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.'' That was a brazen falsehood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Blackwell was running for re-election to the bench. A week before the Kinder trial he announced that he was switching parties to Republican because ''the Democrat party places far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work and people with a skin that's any color but white. . . . While minorities need to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hard-working taxpayers in this country.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kinder's lawyer asked Judge Blackwell to recuse himself because of his hostile statement suggesting that minorities were not ''hard-working taxpayers.'' The judge refused. The majority on the State Supreme Court said the statement would not ''cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality'' of Judge Blackwell. It was from that dubious assertion that Justice White dissented.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice White has voted to uphold 41 death sentences. He dissented in one case that involved the murder of a sheriff, and for that reason Missouri sheriffs and the National Sheriffs' Association opposed his confirmation. But the Missouri police organization endorsed him, saying Justice White's record ''has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real reason for Senator Ashcroft's opposition was that he is running for re-election next year and wants to look tough on crime. What is shocking is that the other Republicans joined in his cynical performance -- even a supposed moderate like Arlen Specter, who voted for Justice White twice in committee, and then against him on the floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because Justice White is an African-American, the Republicans were accused of racism in rejecting him. I think they were innocent of that charge. They were guilty of something else: dirtying the confirmation process and stabbing a good judge and a good man in the back. Stuart Taylor Jr., The National Journal's respected legal commentator, put it exactly: ''The Senate's vote and the smearing of Justice White were shameful acts of pettiness and partisanship.''</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed		
5c037f464c14cf00019d379f	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421591042.xml.txt	"<div><p>Commentary; SAT's 'Halo Effect' Casts a Long Shadow</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The discussion emanating from the University of California regarding the SAT is an invigorating move for American higher education. It is long overdue. The SAT is ideally viewed as a yardstick of merit. It has been used for decades as a key criterion for admission to four-year colleges and universities. Yet, in reality, the SAT is a poorly defined test that reflects racial and economic privileges. It reproduces sex, race and class inequalities in access to the nation's educational resources that produce wealth and power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The SAT affords a too-easy sorting of students' applications into the categories of admit, maybe admit and don't admit. The problem is that many of the students in the don't-admit category could succeed with flying colors if they were given the chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The SAT creates a halo effect that colors the more holistic evaluation of applicants' statements of purpose and letters of recommendation. It creates a mind-set that is tough to overcome for students who don't have the ""test-wiseness"" to correctly fill the bubbles on questions that involve obscure vocabulary or reasoning that is embedded in white cultural trivia. Students might be expected to know Shakespeare or Voltaire, but they are safe if they are ignorant of Wheatley or Nkrumah. After more than 20 years of college teaching, I've learned that the single most important criterion for a student's success is his or her motivation and effort, attributes that are untapped by SAT scores.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've seen students with abysmal scores excel and students with stellar ones flounder. For millions of aspiring college students, the SAT tests students on material that they have not been taught. In the context of known racial inequalities in educational opportunity, the use of an inflexible yardstick such as the SAT is inherently racist. Ward Connerly, the regent who has led the movement to abolish <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> at UC and in the nation, suggested that he would not want the banning of the SAT to be a ""proxy"" for racial preferences. But the use of the SAT is, in fact, a proxy for maintaining the racial and economic advantages of rich whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UC President Richard H. Atkinson is correct in casting doubt on the SAT, but he is wrong in suggesting that the SAT II, a subject- matter test, is an improvement. Students are advised to take the verbal and math sections of the SAT II (and a subject area of their choosing), which re-create the same biases as the SAT I. Standardized tests cannot assess merit in the context of non- standardized educational experiences. This is also true for the tests that act as gatekeepers to the professions, the MCAT (for medicine), the LSAT (for law) and the GRE (for the social sciences and humanities).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The under-representation of minorities who face discrimination in undergraduate programs dramatically worsens in graduate schools. Much is at stake in Atkinson's proposal because of the multibillion- dollar nature of the testing and test-preparation industries. Students waste valuable time and money in preparing for exams that are irrelevant to their success or failure in higher education. Students take the tests several times in hopes of improving their scores--a cost that is prohibitive to families that do not have financial resources.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SAT scores are weak predictors of first-year college success, explaining only 10% of the variance in grades, and have virtually no bearing on subsequent success or failure. Other measures of presumed merit, such as grade-point averages, are also problematic. GPAs are inflated by advanced placement courses that may produce GPAs above 4.0. We know that students in predominantly African American and Latino schools have less access to these courses, just as they have less access to books and experienced teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a perverse irony, African American and Latino communities support public institutions that they do not benefit from in proportion to their tax dollars. Admissions procedures must eschew criteria that have known biases and incorporate those that allow students' drive and determination to manifest themselves. They should emphasize the more important qualities of critical thinking, intercultural awareness and a healthy skepticism of the so-called knowledge items contained in the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead of spending billions of dollars to exclude students, we should redirect those dollars to create more seats in more universities. At Pitzer College, students, faculty and staff have been engaged in an ongoing dialogue about the merits of the SAT. In a recent opinion study on the matter, the college's constituencies have been nearly evenly divided. Atkinson's bold proposal nudges us in the right direction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Halford H. Fairchild is a professor of psychology and black studies at Pitzer College.

I fell somewhere in the middle: She may have told the truth, but so what?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On bended knee, give thanks if you are too young to remember. A brief summary: Hill testified that then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her by verbally sharing his enjoyment of porn films and his sexual proficiency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, yawn if you must. This was scandalous, of course, because . . . well, I'm still not certain. You see, to be scandalized, one must be deeply sensitive to the mention of anything sexual. Indeed, in this case, one needed to be scandalized for an indefinite period of time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hill's testimony came several years after she worked for Thomas at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where the alleged harassment took place. In other words, she didn't protest at the time of these conversations, which were boorish, assuming they happened as she described. Or were they merely lame attempts at humor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The context has never been clear. In any case, other options available to Hill included telling Thomas to get over himself. Or, at the very least, assuming deep offense, complaining to a higher authority. She did neither, apparently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, nothing was mentioned until Thomas was nominated to the highest court. Would an African American nominee of the liberal persuasion have been subjected to the same kind of interrogation? Only as precedent to riot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clarence Thomas's ""offense"" had nothing to do with whether he did or did not say something off-color to a subordinate. Rather, his offense was being a conservative black man who had the audacity, among other things, to suggest that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> ultimately might do harm to those it was intended to help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now we are revisiting the Thomas hearings, sadly owing to the poor judgment of his wife, Ginni. As all surely know, she recently called Anita Hill and left a voice mail suggesting that Hill apologize for what she did. This jaw-droppingly odd lapse has prompted an unwelcome and sordid review of the past and a deluge of theories to explain Ginni Thomas's action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For one, the same day of the phone call, a story ran on the front page of the New York Times about Ginni Thomas's new nonprofit group, Liberty Central, which aims to organize the Tea Party movement. She was trying to monetize the moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's put a pause on nonsense and concede that the Thomas affair remains a painful memory and maybe, just maybe, the justice's wife needs resolution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, a new player has emerged in the drama: Lillian McEwen, a former Thomas girlfriend from way back, has decided that now is the time to set the record straight. Coincidentally, McEwen is shopping her memoir.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday night, McEwen sat down with Larry King on CNN (where I work) to share her own sexual past with Thomas and her belief that Hill told the truth. She told The Washington Post (where I am a columnist) that Thomas was ""obsessed with porn.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McEwen said she didn't mind the porn, she was just bored by it. She also told King that Thomas, who quit drinking while they were together, became ambitious and obsessed with physical fitness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thomas's history of drinking is no secret to anyone who bothered to read his memoir, ""My Grandfather's Son."" He is brutally honest about his transformation from an angry boy abandoned by his alcoholic father, his upbringing by his grandfather and the nuns at his little Catholic school, and his battle with his own demons and lonely rages to become a thoughtful man deeply respected by fellow members of the court. As Supreme Court analyst Jan Greenburg wrote in ""Supreme Conflict,"" Thomas is the quiet force on the bench who brings others to change their minds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only the heartless would not be moved by Thomas's description of lying at home in a fetal curl, suffering the public humiliation of his hearing, and recognizing that the only route to survival was humility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It had long since become clear to me that this battle was at bottom spiritual, not political,"" he wrote, ""and so my attention shifted from politics to the inward reality of my spiritual life.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proud Thomas said during those hearings that he was the victim of a high-tech lynching. Let's hope he has enough spiritual reserve to survive this second lynching  --  and a big enough heart to forgive poor Ginni.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kathleenparker@washpost.com</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
5c037f464c14cf00019d379f	aa_opeds_sample/txt/408366163.xml.txt	"<div><p>Foreign Affairs in Annapolis</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rushern L. Baker III, a Maryland state legislator from Cheverly in Prince George's County, was ""a little taken aback"" when a former ambassador and a deputy assistant secretary of state showed up in Annapolis to lobby him last week. Their mission: to block a Baker proposal to impose sanctions against companies that do business in Nigeria, a wanton human-rights abuser in Africa.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State Department officials, like those from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, increasingly are finding that they have to negotiate with Americans as well as their foreign counterparts. From Massachusetts to California to New York City, local initiative and foreign policy are coming into conflict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is America's thickening connections with the world. ""You have to go back to George Washington's day to find a time when the United States was as dependent on foreign trade and investment as it is today,"" says Alan Larson, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs and the boss of last week's emissaries to Annapolis. In 1970 imports and exports were equivalent to 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product; today they're up to 30 percent. U.S. investments overseas, and foreign investments here, also have soared.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's not just a question of volume. As ties grow, the United States increasingly is trying to shape other countries' societies. Trade talks used to focus on tariffs, duties, anti-dumping provisions and other matters that only trade lawyers understood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. officials focus on what they call ""non-tariff barriers"": corruption, inadequate antitrust law, even zoning-like regulations that may work against U.S. products. In Europe, the United States is fighting health laws that keep out U.S. beef. In Japan, the United States attacks laws that help preserve neighborhoods by shielding small shops from competition -- but also make life difficult for U.S. exporters. U.S. labor unions want the administration to pressure other nations to allow collective bargaining.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, other nations don't always welcome these initiatives. Even less surprisingly, they have their own ideas about how the United States should organize itself. To win the right to challenge foreign barriers before international judges, America has had to subject itself to the same rules. Baker says he modeled his anti-Nigeria law on state laws that helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But in the intervening years, the United States has signed on to treaties that preclude such laws -- and that give other nations the right to demand compensation from Washington if their firms are barred in Maryland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no question, the State Department's Larson says, that the stuff of international negotiation today tends tend to ""get into your living room"" more than in the past. He should know; he's point man for a treaty-in-progress known as the Multilateral Agreement on Investments. Under negotiation for 2 1/2 years, this far-reaching pact would in most cases bind nations to treat foreign companies as they do their own, so that firms can invest across borders without fear of expropriation or unfair favoritism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The MAI hasn't yet attracted much attention in Washington. But it's the object of fevered opposition on talk radio and in some corners of the Internet. In the preface to a recently published tract, ""MAI and the Threat to American Freedom,"" Lori Wallach and Ralph Nader describe the proposed treaty as ""enormously secretive and powerful"" and ""a slow-motion coup d'etat against democratic governance in the United States, Canada and abroad. . . . ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to being secretive, the entire soporific text is available on the Web site of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, under whose auspices the negotiations are taking place (www.oecd.org). But opponents are more persuasive when they list decisions they say could be taken out of Americans' hands. Since MAI would forbid countries from demanding a certain level of investment, wouldn't the Community Reinvestment Act -- which says banks must invest in low-income neighborhoods -- be thrown out? Since the treaty bans anything ""tantamount"" to expropriation, couldn't a foreign tobacco company challenge advertising restrictions that reduce the value of its investment? What about state laws that limit hunting licenses or farmland ownership to locals, minority contractor set-asides, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, right-to-work laws?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials say none of these would be affected. Government procurement would be exempted, all state and local laws would be grandfathered, the ""tantamount"" language would be amended to underscore the inviolability of legitimate health, environmental and safety regulation. Moreover, they argue that MAI would help American workers, because U.S. firms in today's economy need to operate effectively abroad to remain healthy at home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Clinton administration, still smarting from the defeat of fast-track trade legislation, isn't pushing MAI too hard. The original plan was to wrap up talks by May; now U.S. officials say they need at least another year, and they'll oppose any firm deadline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More to the point, they have learned from fast-track that they have to consult, while treaties are still being shaped, more than ever before -- with unions, local officials, environmentalists and others. The more the scope of trade talks goes beyond tariffs, the less they can be left exclusively to trade officials.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, as State Department officials know from their work in foreign capitals, consultation doesn't guarantee agreement. ""The State Department testimony only helped me more,"" says Baker. ""They admitted that what's going on in Nigeria is terrible -- and they couldn't point to much that they are doing about it."" Before it's over for U.S. diplomats, Annapolis may make Pyongyang look easy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is a member of the editorial page staff.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed		
5c037f464c14cf00019d379f	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2414754878.xml.txt	"<div><p>Roberts to Trump: Don’t Take the Supreme Court for Granted</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A week of decisions contained hidden and not-so-hidden messages from the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suppose there had been a leak from the Supreme Court early Thursday morning: The court was about to issue its long-awaited decision in the DACA case on the fate of nearly 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers; the vote was 5 to 4; and the majority opinion was by Chief Justice John Roberts. But the leaker didn’t know, or wouldn’t say, which way the case came out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Dreamers and their supporters, hearts would have been in their throats. This was the chief justice, after all, who two years ago wrote the opinion upholding President Trump’s Muslim travel ban, and who five years before that wrote the opinion dismantling the Voting Rights Act. The vote in both was 5 to 4. Why wouldn’t the conservative chief justice defer to the president’s decision to end a program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that his predecessor had instituted by executive action without even seeking Congress’s approval?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president’s allies would have had ample reason to be anxious. Wasn’t this the chief justice who just a year ago wrote the majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 blocked the president’s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census? The proposal failed the essential requirement of administrative law for “reasoned decision making,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote in that case. He dismissed the administration’s proffered good-government rationale as pretextual; or, as the dictionary puts it, “dubious or spurious.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, of course, we know that it was the Chief Justice Roberts of the census decision, which an enraged President Trump came within inches of defying, who arrived on the scene in time to save the Dreamers. His opinion assured readers that in holding that the administration’s effort to undo DACA was invalid, the court was not endorsing the program. That is conventional administrative law talk — and the case, as the chief justice framed it, was a conventional one about administrative procedure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration’s explanation for why it was terminating DACA — explained in a single sentence by an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (“Taking into consideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated”) — was so inadequate as to make the decision “arbitrary and capricious,” Chief Justice Roberts said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the department came up with a more elaborate explanation nine months later in response to an unfavorable Federal District Court ruling, the chief justice said that it was a “foundational principle of administrative law” that an agency, once challenged, has to defend its action on the grounds it initially invoked, not on an after-the-fact rationalization, unless it wants to restart from scratch the process of arriving at a decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dry procedural language of the opinion, including its invitation to the Trump administration to start over and find a new way to defend terminating DACA, seems to have lulled many readers into assuming that the victory for the Dreamers is less than complete. No doubt many eyes had glazed over by Page 24, when the chief justice began a crucial discussion of the “reliance interests” in favor of continuing the program that permits DACA recipients to live and work lawfully in the only country that most of them have ever known.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Citing statistics in briefs filed by, among others, a group of 143 businesses, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that those with a stake in continuing the program included not only the Dreamers themselves but also their families, “including their 200,000 U.S.-citizen children,” “employers who have invested time and money in training them” and state and local governments that would lose tax revenue from DACA recipients’ earnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Administrative law requires the agency to take reliance interests into account, Chief Justice Roberts said. “DHS may determine, in the particular context before it, that other interests and policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests,” he said, adding, “Making that difficult decision was the agency’s job, but the agency failed to do it.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And can the Trump administration do it now? Theoretically yes, under still another acting homeland security secretary, but any newly justified rescission announcement would find the administration back in court within hours, the clock ticking all the while toward Election Day. Although the chief justice nominally left it up to the administration to weigh the reliance interests against its policy goal, his exposition of the strength of those interests sets a very high bar for this or any subsequent administration to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where was the other Chief Justice Roberts this week, the one of the disastrous Shelby County v. Holder voting rights decision and of the travel ban decision? Was the Chief Justice Roberts who silently joined Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion bringing L.G.B.T.Q. people within the protection of federal anti-discrimination law the same chief justice who wrote a snarky dissenting opinion five years ago when the court upheld the constitutional right to same-sex marriage?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contemplating this head-snapping week at the Supreme Court, I’m reminded of the amazing 2002-2003 term, when the court under another conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist, seemed to pull its robust conservatism up short. In the space of a few weeks in the spring of 2003, the court upheld <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in higher education; granted constitutional protection to gay men and lesbians for their private sexual lives; and upheld the application of the family-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act to state employees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Rehnquist himself was in dissent in the first two of those cases, but he surprised nearly everyone by writing the majority opinion in the third, a case that may sound obscure now but that effectively spelled an end to the federalism revolution on which, under the chief justice’s leadership, the court had been embarked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could have accounted for that surprising turn of events at the dawn of the new century? Wrestling with that question, I eventually concluded that the court was realigning itself, as it has done historically, with its own sense of what the public wanted and expected from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“No great Supreme Court case is only a question of law,” I wrote then. “It is always also an episode in the ongoing dialogue by which the court engages with the society in which it operates and in which the justices live.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just so with this week’s cases. Monday’s ruling on the right of gay and transgender people to be free of discrimination in the workplace showed a court that by a refreshing vote of 6 to 3 decided not to stand in the path of a tide of social change. The DACA decision contained a message threaded through its dry language of administrative procedure — a warning to the Trump administration not to assume that it gets a free pass, not to take the Supreme Court for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“This is not the case for cutting corners,” the chief justice wrote. That’s a sentence sure to be echoing in the halls of the solicitor general’s office, where Chief Justice Roberts once worked and where he honed his ability to speak to the Supreme Court. Now, with four colleagues to his left and four to his right, he speaks for the court from a center chair that must often feel like a lonely place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the decisions due in the next few weeks on abortion, religion, the president’s tax returns and the Electoral College, among other cases, it’s too soon to place a label on this pandemic-disrupted Supreme Court term. The justices will issue decisions that will infuriate, reassure, surprise and even break hearts, as they evidently broke Senator Josh Hawley’s on Monday. The Missouri Republican took to the Senate floor to bemoan “the end of the conservative legal movement.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as the ambitious young senator, a former law clerk to Chief Justice Roberts, surely knows, there is no end, only a new beginning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Neglectful landlords. Battles over minority enrollment. In the imagination of many liberal New Yorkers, private universities like New York and Columbia are often at odds with struggling communities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's Dr. Allan J. Formicola to contradict the usual image. Retiring this month after 23 years as dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, Dr. Formicola, 61, used his position to attract minorities to the dental school and to bring high-quality dental care to Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Formicola, a man with two wings of curly salt-and-pepper hair and a warm  manner, achieved this partly through a personality that makes him as comfortable in a boardroom as on a street corner. He reached out to minority alumni, some of whom had felt isolated at the dental school. At a time of falling enrollment at dental schools nationally, he sold Columbia on encouraging new black and brown faces and more local involvement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The grandson of Italian immigrants, Dr. Formicola was only 38 when he arrived at Columbia in 1978. But his resume included a stint in the late 60's teaching at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a city infamous for its treatment of black people. He describes himself as someone who was always enamored of the ideals of the Great Society and the civil rights movement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''He's got a tremendous amount of respect from the people in Harlem,'' said Paul Dunn, vice president of Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement. ''He's a man who's had a lot of vision and a lot of commitment to bringing people together and building bridges.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia and Harlem, in particular, have had a fractious relationship. Most famously, the 1968 student protest was sparked by Columbia's plan to build a gym in Morningside Park. Recently, Columbia's Morningside Heights neighbors took the university to court over plans to build faculty housing and an elementary school on West 110th Street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dental school, founded in 1852 and incorporated into Columbia in 1917, had its own history, mostly of indifference. Only 13 blacks graduated from the the school between 1923 and 1980. Dr. Formicola helped enhance minority enrollment to the point that out of a student body of about 300, each class has 6 to 10 blacks and 6 to 8 Latinos. Also under his guidance, Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood now have three community health centers, dental clinics in seven neighborhood schools, and a van offering dental care to children and the aged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Formicola's achievements are an implicit answer to a question behind the never-ending debate about <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and other issues involving inequality: what do those in power owe those on the other end?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''It's hard to say when you're sitting in the midst of a community in need that our mission should be research and education,'' Dr. Formicola said as he sat in his immaculate office in Washington Heights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia's dental school now leads the nation in projects like community partnerships for clinics, said Dennis Mitchell-Lewis, an assistant professor at the school and the director of many of the outreach efforts. ''Dean Formicola has changed everything,'' Dr. Mitchell-Lewis said. ''He added community service to the mission of the dental school. He has a unique way with people. I've had him on 127th Street at 7:30 p.m, meeting with 14 women from a women's group from a little church.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Albert Thompson, a black graduate now in private practice in Manhattan, was one who answered Dr. Formicola's call in 1978 to help recruit minority students, faculty and administrators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all the attention paid to drawing minorities into the professions, fewer than 5  percent of American dentists are black. And yet minority graduates are more likely to go to work in minority neighborhoods, where inadequate dental care remains a problem, resulting in everything from children with excessive cavities to disparities between white and nonwhite survivors of oral cancers. There are still no pediatric dentists or oral surgeons in private practice in Harlem, Dr. Mitchell-Lewis said, even as research shows a link between oral health and heart disease, diabetes and premature babies. ''We are still at the beginning,'' he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question now is whether the successes achieved under Dr. Formicola will continue. ''He's created the template,'' Mr. Dunn said. ''Hopefully, Columbia will continue the legacy.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Mark Matcho)</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

Unfamiliar with the surroundings in the dark, he bonks his head on the refrigerator and is out cold for three and a half years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When he opens his eyes in 1992, refreshed after his long rest, he sees the face of White House chief of staff John Sununu peering down at him. Mr. Bush's first words are ''How fares the nation?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Everything is in great shape,'' Mr. Sununu reports. ''Peace, prosperity without inflation, the kinder-gentler thing doing fine. One of Millie's grandpuppies just had her first litter, and the Post Office is delivering the announcement cards.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The President warily asks for specifics: ''How much does it cost to mail a letter from Washington to California?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Same as last year,'' shrugs Sununu, ''300 yen.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To discover if such complacency is rampant at the center of power, and to track down the source of a troubling new phrase, I visited Governor Sununu in his West Wing office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is, as they say, sharp. When I recalled hours spent in that corner office with a previous occupant, and added wistfully, ''Say what you like about Haldeman, nobody ever ran into his motorcades,'' Mr. Sununu smiled and replied, ''I'll mention that to Cheney.'' He had caught the obscure allusion to inept Presidential motorcading during the Ford Administration when Dick Cheney was chief of staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, he is still insecure and wet behind his White House ears. In our interview, which was on foreground, he had his deputy sit in to take notes, sign of a player new to the big leagues and fearful of being misquoted. He had his secretary rush in with a message about being late for a meeting with the President, which he waved off to flatter his visitor but also to impress him with the value of the time being taken up. That hoary heave-ho technique is known to Oval Officiators as ''the 10-minute bounce.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about the perception of leisureliness in governance, the near-palindromic aide offered a fresh metaphor to explain the failure to understand the Bush approach: ''Ours is a different template.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Translation: You can no longer use the Reagan template on the keyboard of power. (A template in this sense is a plastic instruction sheet cut out to overlay the computer's keys.) The Bush template reflects a different processing system: if you hold down Alt and push F9, you will now get conciliation where you used to get confrontation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I take this to mean, for example, that the deal made with Speaker Wright to keep the contras fed while giving a policy veto on Nicaragua to Congress would be an unprincipled cave-in on the Reagan template, but is a net pragmatic gain on the Bush template.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief of staff ''had a little chat with'' Boyden Gray about the way the President's counsel, shut out of that Baker-Sununu-Scowcroft project, objected publicly. I think Mr. Gray was right in trying to stop an evisceration of Presidential power, but Mr. Sununu disagrees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was not trapped by what was artfully presented as a linguistic question. The phrase enhanced rescission is being whispered in the corridors of power. Sounds like a tricky euphemism; what does it mean?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''It's an alternative to the line-item veto,'' he said, suggesting Bob Dole as the best source about that, I presume to avoid letting it appear to be an executive initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The power to impound - to not spend - funds appropriated by Congress was taken away from a weakened President in 1974; Mr. Reagan's counterattack, the line-item veto, never had a chance of passage. That leaves a middle ground of ''rescission,'' or getting Congress to agree to rescind parts of appropriations, to be ''enhanced'' by making unnecessary the current affirmative legislative action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The upshot would be a substantial giveback of executive authority, as evidence that the Tower appointment precedent and the contra-veto usurpation were not waves of the future. It would show, too, that the Bush White House was effectively at work behind the scenes, progressing without grandstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will Mr. Sununu and budgeteer Dick Darman win this for President Bush? I don't see how, if their standard becomes a white feather on a flapping doormat, but for my different template, I am willing to plunk down about 300 yen.</p></div>		stance:::None/Not Discussed

The growing number of jobs lost to this crafty creature that seems to be nowhere and everywhere at once is startling enough to make us question our assumptions about how to plan a future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the goal was once to ensure a college education for everyone, the more prudent policy now might be to help people develop skills related to outdoor work and other physically demanding jobs. Chatbots can write, but they can't change a lightbulb. They can't plumb a house. They can't heal the sick with a human touch or grow vegetables or perform countless other jobs that fill humanity's most crucial needs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the confused, ""GPT"" stands for ""generative pre-trained transformer,"" which refers to how ChatGPT processes, requests and formulates responses. ChatGPT is trained via reinforcement and reward models that rank the best responses. Something like that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the reasoning behind the high court's 6-3 decision on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is best left to lawyers - speaking of replaceable professions - the implications of the explosive expansion of AI into new arenas should be obvious to anyone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During a visit with my son, I brought up the subject of AI, and he quickly begged for a subject change. ""I don't want to talk about it,"" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Why not?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Because it upsets me.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, he has reason to be worried. A writer with a law degree, he depends on regular clients to earn a living. He's fine for now, thanks to his unique niche, but other writers similarly situated have lost their entire client lists overnight. Post tech reporters Pranshu Verma and Gerrit De Vynck recently described a Bloomingdale, Ill., writer, Eric Fein, whose clients - all of them - notified him that they were ""transitioning"" to AI. Is anyone not transitioning these days?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fein has returned to school to become an HVAC technician. Another displaced writer, this one in San Francisco, has started a job as a dog walker.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amid the disruption, irony remains fully employed. Is technology, in replacing humans, also making us more human? More time spent outdoors is surely healthier than sitting at a desk for hours a day. If more people turn to skilled labor, might we finally be able to find dependable help on household troubles beyond our ken?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A forthcoming ""wearable AI assistant"" from a company called Humane is meant to revolutionize both technology and humanity. Imran Chaudhri, Humane's co-founder and chairman, describes his pocket-size invention as intentionally humanizing, because it eliminates the need for devices - smart phones, watches, even computers - that act as barriers to human interaction. Chaudhri's device performs the functions of all the above and more, using the palm of the hand as a display screen so your face is free to express emotions, make eye contact and, not least, see where you're going.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such developments are both frightening and exhilarating. The possibilities for liberation and creativity are limited only by the imagination. But the threat to life as we know it - and especially to white-collar (or work-at-home-hoodie) jobs - is potentially catastrophic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the bright side, AI isn't always so smart. Or, rather, it's smart in a Vulcan way. All brain, no emotion, makes for a lousy human. Writers can be replaced if all you need is a user manual, but AI doesn't have the emotional depth or experiential memory to write beautifully, using just the right word or nuance. An algorithm might come up with the likeliest word used by most people most of the time, but a good writer knows better ones. Voice and style are as individual as a fingerprint.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least one of Fein's clients has realized that his content was better than AI's and has returned. Others decided that the quality sacrifice was worth the cost savings. Humans, after all, need steady salaries and health benefits, vacations, sick days and family leave. AI needs nothing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can't at this point see exactly how AI might evolve. We know instinctively that the good often is shadowed by the bad. How many ways will we regret our eager embrace of machine over man? Of such is science fiction written, though I suspect AI would be a lousy author. Great literature comes to us from people who have dug deep into their psyches, experiences, sorrows, triumphs, fears, losses and aspirations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do wonder about all the folks who no longer will be admitted to colleges and universities because they don't meet certain data-driven standards and, therefore, won't have the opportunity to study humankind's greatest achievements.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The immediate losers will be the students of color who might have benefited from <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. But in the longer run, the real loser might well be academia. Young men already have abandoned college in huge numbers, leaving women to dominate in many fields that AI loves. Add Black and Brown young people to decreasing enrollments and who's left? And who will teach? AI, I'm afraid.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court says <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> belongs to another generation and is no longer needed. It would be nice to think so, but my hunch is that many Americans would agree with Suzanne Szostak, co-innkeeper of Mine + Farm, my favorite getaway here in Sonoma County.

63ed99d5c3520191a0a7280e	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1548604795.xml.txt	"<div><p>U.T. Austin's affirmative action program is a careful effort to ensure diversity (Posted 2014-07-28 00:15:53)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LAST YEAR, the Supreme Court ordered the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to reconsider the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> program at the University of Texas at Austin. This month, the appeals court determined again that the university's admissions policies were constitutional. This was not much of a surprise: The 5th Circuit sided with the university the last time it examined this case. Much less predictable is how the Supreme Court will rule when the dispute comes before the justices for a second time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We wouldn't accuse them of having an easy task. Every American should be wary of any instance in which the government distinguishes between people based on race, with bad or good motivations. But in its ruling, the 5th Circuit offered the justices several good reasons to side with the university. Among them: If, as the justices have said, the Constitution can bear public universities instituting some kind of narrow, careful <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> admissions policies, UT Austin's modest program is a prime example of the sort that should survive judicial scrutiny.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Texas fills most of the seats at its premier public university with students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school classes -- state policy guarantees them admission. This has had the effect of drawing some students from areas of the state where minorities make up the majority without distinguishing among students based on race. The case is about what the university can do from there. UT fills the rest of its classes with students who get in under a comprehensive, holistic review of their academic and personal records. In that analysis, race can be used as ""a factor of a factor of a factor of a factor,"" as advocates put it, as admissions officers assemble a complete picture of an applicant's profile. The 5th Circuit points out that this resembles the sort of individualized review of applicants that the Supreme Court has insisted must occur if race is to be explicitly considered in public university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university's opponents charge that the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> policy is unnecessary. The top 10 percent program already pulls in minority students. Why do any more?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the reasons are the fact that the top 10 percent scheme's effects on diversity stem from ongoing racial segregation in Texas schools. The scheme also is a blunt tool that overlooks applicants who want to and would contribute to the university. The experience of a minority applicant from a majority minority school, for example, may well be quite different than that of a minority applicant from a majority white school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another lesson from the 5th Circuit's ruling: One reason this and other <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> cases are difficult is that the Supreme Court has not offered public university officials clear guidance on what is constitutionally acceptable. According to the court, public universities, for example, can attempt to achieve a ""critical mass"" of minority students on campus to expose students to diverse viewpoints and prepare them to participate in a multi-ethnic society. What a ""critical mass"" looks like, though, is not certain. The Supreme Court should clear up the confusion. In the process, the justices should affirm that UT's conscientiously designed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> program, a cautious effort to complement the race-neutral top 10 percent program and seek diversity from a range of student profiles, is permissible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
63ed99d5c3520191a0a7280e	aa_opeds_sample/txt/432415722.xml.txt	"<div><p>Fixing the Race Gap in 25 Years or Less</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE Supreme Court decision upholding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in university admissions seemed to carry an expiration date. ''We expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her 5-to-4 majority opinion last week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the justices have in the past said that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> should not be used forever, never before has a justice placed a specific time limit on it. Having now done so, Justice O'Connor has raised tough questions, both broad and specific.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are her views merely idle musings, or will they become an iron-clad legal principle? Should the goal be parity in graduation rates of white, black and Hispanic high school students? Or should it be equality in financing between poor school districts, which tend to have more minority students, and middle-class white ones? Can the gap between black and white students on the SAT be bridged in the next generation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In The Chicago Tribune, Justice O'Connor said in a rare interview that the country can tackle many of these challenges. ''I hope it looks as though we don't need artificial help to fill our classrooms with highly qualified students at the graduate level,'' she said. ''And if we do our job on educating young people, we can reach that goal.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But closing the disparities in educational achievement and opportunities for college applicants across racial and ethnic lines will involve vociferous debate over the relative importance of school financing, social inequality and student study habits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Statistics tell the story. On every major indicator of academic success -- the SAT, the A.C.T. and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (given to elementary and secondary students) -- the gap between white and minority students has persisted for decades. Though it narrowed somewhat on the national assessment exams from the 1980's through the early 90's, the divide has only widened since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''There is some serious heavy lifting to do before we get to the dream scenario Justice O'Connor is envisioning,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and an assistant secretary of education in the Reagan administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some liberals say the gap can be closed only by equalizing the amount of money spent on educating whites and minorities. The school districts that many blacks and Hispanics attend spend $902 less per student on average than mostly white districts, according to a national study conducted last year by the Education Trust, a group focused on closing the achievement gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some degree, federal and state governments can, and do, try to fix this imbalance by sending more money to schools serving poor -- and, by extension, disproportionately minority -- students. Federal assistance for poor students is increasing, and state governments gave an average of $27 more per pupil to disproportionately minority schools in 2000 than to predominately white schools, though that hardly had a perceptible impact on the financing gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if federal and state lawmakers were bent on eliminating the financial discrepancies between white and minority districts, they couldn't have much affect. On average, states and the federal government have never accounted for more than 56 percent of schools' revenues over the last decade or so; the remainder has come from local sources, mostly property taxes. This financial structure makes parity unlikely at best.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And conservatives argue that the focus on financial parity misses the point, and point to some minority-dominated city school districts that have high spending per student but still lag well behind less flush districts, particularly in rural areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, educational parity may be linked to bigger, more complex economic factors. Most beneficiaries of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> are middle-income. According to a study by Anthony Carnevale, vice president of the Educational Testing Service, 74 percent of students at the 146 most prestigious colleges and universities -- where competition for admissions is most intense and where <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is practiced -- come from families in the top 25 percent of the nation's socioeconomic scale (as measured by income, educational attainment and occupations of the parents). Only 3 percent of the students at these highly selective schools come from the bottom 25 percent of the socioeconomic scale. As Lani Guinier, a law professor at Harvard University, puts it, ''<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is less an escalator up than it is a bridge across.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even middle-class black and Hispanic children who are burdened with issues of crime, troubled homes and poor schools have not been able to close the test-score gap with their white counterparts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The gap persists across all income levels,'' said Freeman Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, who has written extensively on improving the academic achievement of black students. ''We're talking about generations of habits in too many homes,'' said Mr. Hrabowski, who is black. ''Unfortunately, reading is not the No. 1 priority as a habit. There is much more emphasis on television watching.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both sides on the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> issue agree on the need to close the education gap, but not much else. Some supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hope that Justice O'Connor's 25-year time frame will protect <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> while the country makes headway in closing that rift.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the decision last week does not invalidate laws in California and Washington State that ban the use of race in public university admissions, hiring and government contracting. Ward Connerly, the black California businessman who was the force behind passing those laws, has already vowed to make Michigan his next target.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demographic pressures will also come into play. The Educational Testing Service estimates that from 1995 to 2015, the percentage of whites on college campuses will decline from 71 percent to 63 percent, while Hispanics will increase to 15 percent, from the current 11 percent, with blacks holding steady at 13 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with minorities making up a larger proportion of students going to college -- and with the children of young immigrants approaching college age toward the end of Justice O'Connor's 25-year target -- Hispanic and black parents may be clamoring even more forcefully that their children not be shut out of top schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the debate has not changed. Opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> will continue to say that such programs keep the country from focusing on what needs to be done -- namely, helping minority students meet higher standards. The supporters of race preferences counter that the country cannot end <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> without first fixing the education system. All agree that unless a commitment is made -- by society and minority families themselves -- the old arguments will still be around in 25 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lisa Navarette, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said, ''If all we do over the 25 years is <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, then we will still need <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, 1964: The University of Michigan Law School yearbook reflects the times.

Few experts in the press or academe wanted to probe this most politically incorrect topic until Louisiana's David Duke seized the issue and became a political force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>General population polls conducted by Gordon Black Associates in 1984 and by the National Opinion Research Center in 1990 suggest that 1-in-10 white men has been injured by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. This figure alone adds up to millions. Circumstantial evidence suggests even larger numbers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Preferential policies were instituted during an intensely competitive era when huge cohorts of baby boomers crowded job markets increasingly constrained by international competition, lean-and-mean downsizing movements, and tax revolts. Thus, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> often occurred in zero-sum contexts; someone was quota-ed in at another's expense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My research indicates that reverse discrimination's bite has varied by age, geography, occupation, and private or public sector. Most vulnerable have been public-sector white men under the age of 45 with people-oriented skills. Their phone calls flood radio talk-show programs on this topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many more white men may not have been fully aware that they were being injured by behind-the-scenes tactics such as ""race-norming"" of employment tests by public testing agencies, and many private ones. (The EEOC only recently stopped pressuring corporations to use such procedures.) Nor have they been told of the drive to tie managers' bonuses to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hiring and promotion records.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I became curious about the impact of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> while working in the increasingly quota-crazy higher education systems of California -- where policies moved far beyond the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke dictum that race could be considered as one of several factors in selection processes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the 1980s, a state mandate for the community college system (AB1725) ordered a 30% minority-faculty hiring ""goal"" until the year 2005 -- when faculty must mirror the ethnic diversity of the entire state; the University of California began advertising ""targets of diversity"" faculty positions and substantially boosted minority-female representation in administrative staff positions to 72%; and the California State University system implemented set-aside faculty positions, set-aside grant and fellowship programs for graduate students -- while the politically correct faculty union lobbied (successfully) for higher pay for ""underrepresented"" junior faculty. And ""parity goals"" for the entire state work force were monitored in annual reports by the State Personnel Board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As my quiet interest in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> leaked out -- a professionally dangerous development -- students, colleagues, friends and relative strangers began to report encounters with reverse discrimination. In 1984-85, two graduate assistants and I supplemented this rising tide of informal data -- and scattered press reports -- with 32 in-depth interviews with California-based, mostly middle-class white men who reported that preferential policies prevented them from obtaining jobs or disrupted or ended extant careers. Some findings:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A community college instructor repeatedly lost tenure-track appointments to less qualified minorities after he moved to California from Michigan. ""At first, you think it's you,"" he said. ""You blame yourself."" (He finally obtained an appointment at another college.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A mid-management bank administrator -- and an ardent liberal -- began to have second thoughts as he watched women he'd hired the year before move by him on the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> fast-track. (Rapid increases in female mid-management employees in his bank and at others lent credence to his account.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Public-sector workers reported that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> barriers eventually became obvious and quietly acknowledged by most employees. After 13 years of being bypassed by minorities or women, one upper-middle-management California state official reported being offered a promotion -- with some public fanfare -- only to have the appointment rescinded because, as an agency head told him, ""Let's face it, you're not the right color.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of these men avoided open complaints or protests out of fear they wouldn't be believed or would be labeled racist. (No one said he feared being thought sexist.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Six resigned from the organizations that discriminated against them. Three circumvented reverse discrimination problems through various organizational means. Three filed suits, none of which was successful. No government agency offered redress. (EEOC guidelines effectively insulate employers from reverse discrimination complaints if the employer has taken ""reasonable"" voluntary <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> to remedy ""deficiencies"" in minority representation.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of our subjects simply acquiesced in their treatment with varying degrees of bewilderment, resignation or anger. Most subjects voiced temporary, if not long-term, frustration and cynicism about social institutions. ""A lot of us were sold a bill of goods,"" complained a California state middle-management worker. ""We were told if you went to college you could write your own ticket. But . . . <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has lowered standards to the point where education counts against you.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No subject expressed hostility toward minorities per se, but many felt alienated from a society that refused to acknowledge whites' victimization. A teacher, transferred to a distant school in a racial balancing plan, commented: ""My friends couldn't handle this. They experienced cognitive dissonance. They didn't want to be seen as racists."" Another teacher noted: ""I found out what it was like to be a victim. Nobody likes a victim.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Research sponsored and then suppressed by the Democratic Party in 1985 and 1987 suggests a possible class split in white reactions to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Political analyst Stanley Greenberg's ""Report on Democratic Defections"" by blue-collar white ""Reagan Democrats"" in Michigan found fury over quotas for blacks and immigrants. (This anger, Mr. Greenberg concluded, undercut Democratic campaign themes of ""fairness"" and ""justice."") These data, in combination with the record of lawsuits filed by blue-collar groups (overtly or covertly aided by unions), indicate a more militant, angry working-class response. This is perhaps because of more intense zero-sum problems wrought by a shrinking blue-collar jobs market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until Pete Wilson, Jesse Helms and David Duke began to attack quotas in statewide election campaigns last year, a curious bipartisan paralysis thwarted any open political response to rank-and-file whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Radicals and liberals have neutralized whites' complaints with swift, categorical denials, such as ""white males can't be victims."" Indeed, much liberal and multicultural theory today embodies a colorized version of Marx's class struggle. White men (regardless of individual backgrounds) are regarded as a privileged modern-day ""bourgeoisie,"" while women and people of color (again, regardless of individual or subgroup circumstances) are the oppressed ""proletariat."" Any mention of a white working class -- once prominently represented in labor histories -- is simply met with more rationalizations or with awkward silence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives have been inclined to dismiss white men's complaints of reverse discrimination because of conservatism's rugged individualistic and free-market underpinnings. White men injured by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> are likely to be told to ""take it like a man"" and get on with their lives. Conservatives are also likely to harbor the assumption that an injured white man can simply quit the offending organization and get another job or start his own business. And there's been more than a hint of class bias. Conservatives are not overly fond of historically Democratic, unionized, white, blue-collar and public-sector workers. Some right-of-center writers have sneered at ""firefighters"" (presumably racist brethren of Archie Bunker) who complain of reverse discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stereotype of ""racist"" working-class white men has made most journalists, academics and politicians fearful of acquiring a ""racist"" label themselves if they even raise the white-male problem. Thus, most of the recent debate over <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has focused on the safer topics of costs to employers and the stigmatization of officially favored groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unwanted, inadvertent findings about whites and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have been buried. Just as the Greenberg studies were suppressed in the mid-1980s, a 1990 study by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, designed to provide impetus for the 1991 civil rights bill, was bottled up. News leaks indicated the study uncovered substantial white anger toward <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One study not buried was the recent, well-publicized Urban Institute study in which matched black/white pairs of job seekers were sent out to test discrimination in hiring. In 67% of the outcomes, neither applicant was offered a job; in 13%, both the black and white applicants were offered the job; in 15% of the cases, only the white applicant was offered the job, while in 5% of the cases the black received the offer-indicating only minimal levels of reverse discrimination. However, the institute study ignored the public sector entirely, as well as people-oriented, liberal-arts types of jobs. Would the institute be willing to dispatch black/white teams to apply for openings in California state agencies? In universities?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span>'s impact upon white males must also be viewed as a legitimate topic of discussion if we are to understand how these policies have both functioned and malfunctioned. An earlier, fair hearing of whites' complaints might have led to the recognition that, in practice, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has become what George Will has aptly termed a racial spoils system with all attendant corruptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lingering white racism is to be condemned. But it is unjust and inaccurate to automatically attribute whites' criticisms of flawed policies to racism. Further suppression will only obscure troubling realities and lead to emotional exploitation of an important topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lynch is visiting associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California, and author of ""Invisible Victims: White Males and the Crisis of Affirmative Action"" (Praeger Paperbacks, 1991).</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

I have never doubted Ashcroft's decency, never questioned his legal abilities, never worried that, in a particular case, he would be unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the attorney general is not just the nation's chief cop. He is also the chief influencer of our law-enforcement policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is from that office that decisions are made on which laws to enforce, and how vigorously; what discretion ought to be exercised, and in which direction; how law-enforcement resources should be deployed, and with what emphases. Bland reassurances that Ashcroft would ""enforce the law fairly"" aren't much help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take a simple example, what does it mean to enforce America's drug laws ""fairly""? Does it mean locking up anybody caught with illegal drugs, as the law permits? Does it mean focusing resources on major traffickers, as the law also permits? Does it mean shifting resources from enforcement to treatment -- or the other way around? Does it mean confiscating more and more assets of people found in violation of the drug laws? The law allows all these things -- allows as well the disparate sentencing for powdered and ""crack"" cocaine and the well-documented racial disparity that results from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To promise to enforce the law without talking about which policies would be emphasized or changed is to say nothing at all. Absent a president with strong feelings on the matter,  law-enforcement policy is largely left to attorneys general to decide. Some have gone against discrimination, some against organized crime, some against monopolies and trusts. Some have followed public sentiment, and some have gone their own way. Most of the time, it hasn't mattered much. So why do so many non-conservatives believe it will matter so much this time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The answer is in Ashcroft's record of advocacy. He has fought with extraordinary vigor for positions that are well outside the American mainstream -- on gun control, on abortion, on juvenile justice, on the death penalty. I don't mean to deny that his position on all these issues might be shared by a significant minority. I say only that his views are unusually conservative. He is, I think it fair to say, an ideologue. And when you take someone who has been advocating views that are well away from the political center and put him in charge of law-enforcement policy, it's not enough to say he'll ""enforce the law.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ashcroft signaled his own understanding of this point when he was asked whether he would try to undermine the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion. He said that for the solicitor general (who ranks under the attorney general) to petition the Supreme Court to have another look at Roe would undermine the Justice Department's standing before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, as I read his response, saying he could make the attempt, though it might be impolitic to do so at this time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is it unfair to oppose Ashcroft, an experienced lawyer, out of fear that his personal and religious views would influence his role as attorney general?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) reminded us the other day, it is a question Ashcroft himself has answered. When Bill Lann Lee was named by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, Ashcroft fought to deny him the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He had no doubt concerning the nominee's professional ability, Ashcroft said at the time, but Lee's beliefs (on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>) ""limit his capacity to have the balanced view of making judgments that will be necessary for the person who runs the division.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why can't the same assessment apply to the person who will run the whole department?</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

It may seem counterintuitive to suggest that the Caucus should support the passage of legislation that targets the rich for a tax reduction. But a meaningful capital gains tax cut will help those of us in the black community who are helping to create jobs for middle- and working-class people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Passage of a capital gains tax cut will stimulate economic growth by freeing up capital for new investments, including venture capital investments in black-controlled companies, thereby creating jobs for the constituents of CBC members. In the long run, policies that increase the availability of investment capital for entrepreneurial endeavors could completely eliminate the need for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Venture capital, which would receive a big boost from a capital gains tax cut, is a proven method of creating jobs. The most recent study by Venture One Corporation and the National Venture Capital Association found that 495 venture-capital-backed companies generated 75,240 new U.S. jobs between 1989 and 1993. It also found $2 billion of export sales were generated by the same companies. The CBC needs to become a more active and vocal advocate of the black business community in general and the flow of investment capital to black business in particular. As welfare reform increases the pressure on disadvantaged blacks in the inner cities of America, policies that stimulate black business growth are needed to provide opportunities for those coming off the welfare rolls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the moment, the private equity business, with more than $170 billion under management as of year-end 1994 (according to Private Equity Analyst estimates), flourishes with capital contributions from public pensions funds, corporate pension plans, banks and insurance companies. But very little of that capital has been directed to black firms. It is a national problem that deserves national attention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond simply cutting capital gains taxes, there are other measures the government can take to help black-owned busineses. Two initiatives come to mind, both of which can be initiated by the administration without additional legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, since the Labor Department regulates pension funds and has the responsibility to issue interpretations of regulations, Secretary Robert Reich could issue interpretations of current pension fund policies to encourage them to invest in black-owned businesses. The second initiative should be aimed at getting the brokerage industry to raise money for the black companies. With approximately $1 trillion raised each year by the U.S. brokerage industry for American businesses, it would be good business for the major brokerage firms to tap the capital markets on behalf of black businesses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But none of this is a substitute for a capital gains tax cut. The effect on black-controlled businesses would be to greatly increase the flow of venture capital in the form of equity to such businesses. This decade has seen for the first time genuine interest being expressed by the institutional investment community in making venture capital investments in black businesses. Substantially all black-controlled companies are privately held, and are precisely the type of firms that would benefit from an increased infusion of venture capital from institutions and wealthy individuals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A good indication of the impact that such investments can have on black employment lies in a 1993 Wall Street Journal survey, which found that 60% of all black businesses employ a work force at least 70% black. With a badly needed infusion of equity capital to allow them to expand, black firms would create more jobs for the substantially black constituency base of CBC members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are other benefits for the CBC in a capital gains tax cut. It would enable the lawmakers to replace the narrowly targeted broadcast properties tax incentive recently struck down by the Republican majority in Congress with a tax incentive that would benefit all industries in which black businesses operate. It would also enable the CBC to form a unique alliance with the Republican Congress to enact legislation that will help all Americans, including black Americans. Such an alliance would position the CBC as a dynamic voting bloc and its members as leaders able to deliver for their constituents by skillfully adapting to the changing political environment. This would most certainly increase the value of the CBC vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Granger is president of Ark Capital Management in Chicago.

It is New York City's crown jewel, where - like in the fictional Lake Wobegon - all the students really are ""above average."" And just to make matters more intriguing and complicated, Stuyvesant's student body is majority Asian American</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>. The mayor thinks this is a ""monumental injustice"" and that more of the students should be Hispanic and black. For that, he recently asked congregants at a black church for an ""amen.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, from certain critics, he got a groan of opposition and disbelief. In the name of racial equity, fairness and that most deceptive of all words, diversity, he would demolish a system that at Stuyvesant and seven other elite city high schools has, without a doubt, propelled countless poor kids right into the middle class - and beyond.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason I mentioned Trump in the first paragraph is that his base consists, in no small part, of white males who think the deck is stacked against them; that the liberal policies of the Obama years, personified by Hillary Clinton, unfairly favored other groups or, when it came to trade, other nations. You and I may quibble with this view, but then along comes Mayor Bill de Blasio to demand an ""amen"" to his efforts to tilt a color-blind admissions system to get a different blend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Blacks and Hispanics comprise 67 percent</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>of New York's public school students. Yet Stuyvesant's incoming freshman class contains only 10 black students, 27 Hispanics, 151 whites - and 613 Asian Americans. A similar imbalance applies to the city's seven other elite schools, including Brooklyn Tech, where the mayor's son just graduated. Clearly, something is off. In the best of all possible worlds, these schools should have student bodies that reflect the city's demographics. This, though, is not the best of all worlds. It's the one we have.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And in this world, the children of Asian immigrants walk away with the lion's share of admissions. Why? Simple. They study. They study hard. Admissions to New York's academically elite schools is based solely on an entrance exam. That's it. No alumni recommendations. No offer of a contribution. No athletic ability or anything of the sort. Take the test. Score high. Get in. Nothing could be fairer. Yet, de Blasio, a Democrat, wants to do away with the exam all together.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an exhaustive piece for the City Journal about Brooklyn's Chinese American community - one of New York's several Chinatowns - Kay S. Hymowitz writes that ""If, as sometimes appears the case, 'Harvard' is the first English word that immigrant Chinese mothers learn, the second is probably 'Stuyvesant.' ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reading Hymowitz's description of how these parents work around the clock for their children - rising before dawn to ensure that homework is done - is exhausting in itself. Often, they put aside money to have their kids prepped for the Stuyvesant admissions test. This is not a perk of the rich. This is yet another sacrifice these parents make for their children.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My limited tolerance for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> - possibly permissible when the poor are advantaged at the expense of the rich - hits a wall in this case. By and large, the Asian Americans of Stuyvesant are not rich. Many of them are poor, so-called Title I kids, entitled to all sorts of aid. They and their parents played by the rules and studied hard. Why should they be deprived - on the basis of race or ethnicity - of what they earned? That's what the mayor wants to happen. Asian American kids have to make way for black or Hispanic ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The figures are both stark and tragic. But they prove, to the obstinate blindness of the doctrinaire, that poverty is not always the determinant. You can hardly get poorer than many of the Asian immigrants. They come to America with little. Many can't even speak English. In her article, Hymowitz says Chinese families often ""maintain that they have been discriminated against, and they tell their children to expect discrimination as well."" It's a hard, hard life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already, the mayor has reserved some slots for students whoalmostpass the exam so that more black and Hispanic kids will be admitted to the special schools. For him, it is only a beginning. In the name of diversity, he wants to scrap the test and, thereby, destroy a system that epitomized the American dream and - as Trump might say - made America great.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>cohenr@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Richard Cohen</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

The bill will “bring needed transparency to the abusive spying programs that have tarnished the nation’s reputation.” Introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the measure would require the government “to disclose how many people’s data was collected by intelligence agencies, and how many of those people were American.” Perhaps most important, the bill will “create a panel of advocates to argue before the court in support of privacy rights and civil liberties, and would require the court to issue public summaries of its decisions that specifically detail the impact on those rights.” It “represents a breakthrough in the struggle against the growth of government surveillance power.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other significant viewpoints from around the world:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An editorial in The Washington Post supports a decision handed down by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the University of Texas at Austin’s <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> admissions policies. “This was not much of a surprise,” The Post writes. “The 5th Circuit sided with the university last time it examined the case.” Nevertheless, it’s an important move: The Post cites it as “a prime example of the sort that should survive judicial scrutiny.” Texas’s “top 10 percent program” guarantees admission for students in the top 10 percent of every public high-school graduating class, but the U.T. Austin “fills the rest of its classes with students who get in under a comprehensive, holistic review of their academic and personal records.” When the case returns to the Supreme Court, the justices should affirm that U.T.’s “conscientiously designed” program, a cautious effort to complement the race-neutral top 10 percent program and seek diversity, is permissible.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Massachusetts State Legislature “took a big step toward addressing the U.S. Supreme Court’s objections to the state’s ‘buffer-zone’ law,” according to an editorial in The Boston Globe. The buffer-zone law prohibited protesting within 35 feet of the entrance to abortion clinics — it was “deemed by the court to be overly broad, restricting the free speech of the plaintiffs, who sought to dissuade women from having abortions by quietly handing them literature and urging them to consider alternatives.” This new law would permit law-enforcement officers to order protesters to withdraw from an abbreviated buffer zone “if they impede access to the clinic.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“For the past five months, the world’s most important unelected official has been a 67-year-old former economics professor, who’s apparently still pre-gentrified Brooklyn enough to pronounce guide ‘goyd,’” says an editorial in The Guardian. Since Janet Yellen’s appointment to chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, she has “displayed the greatest acuity about what rate-setters must do: ‘The low rate of wage growth is, to me, another sign that the Fed’s job is not yet done.’ Bingo!” The difference between Ms. Yellen and her British counterpart, Mark J. Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is that “while Mr. Carney has his sights set on unemployment, Ms. Yellen doesn’t just want Americans off the dole — she wants to get them a pay rise too.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“The massive, worldwide die-off of honeybees has been one of the biggest environmental scares of this new century,” says an editorial in The Globe and Mail. “The possible extinction of the planet’s most prolific pollinator is more than a bit terrifying.” But “colony collapse disorder, while a real threat, is being remarkably well managed.” Governments, scientists and beekeepers “have been making steady progress against it” — the European Union has imposed a two-year ban on three types of pesticide especially harmful to bees to measure whether their absence improves bee-colony health. Meanwhile, the Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists “has done and excellent job of monitoring wintering losses since colony collapse disorder first came to light,” and their annual reports since show a slowly declining average mortality rate during winter months. “There is more work and research to be done, but the outlook is hopeful.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“Last week, the U.N. Committee on Human Rights called on Japan to ensure that effective, independent and impartial investigations be launched into wartime sex slavery and to offer an apologia to ‘comfort women,’ who were forced to work in its military brothels,” according to an editorial in The Korea Herald. Tokyo rejected the committee’s request. “While expressing regrets about the recommendation, the Abe government denied again that Korean and other Asian women were coerced into military sex slavery.” This historical revisionism is “angering Korea and other victimized Asian countries,” The Herald writes, and if Japan wishes to maintain “harmonious, friendly relations” with Korea, Mr. Abe’s government must come to terms with its colonial history.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

The experiences he recounted were ""a source of amazement and inspiration,"" she wrote, not only for what they revealed about him ""but also because of what they instill in, and ask, of us."" She said she found herself ""hoping to hear, just once more, another story that would, by and by, perhaps change the way I see the world.""I was touched by the essay when I first read it, but also puzzled. If I had been asked to name justices who were immune to Thurgood Marshall's influence, Justice O'Connor, who had been on the court for 11 years and had served with him for 10 years, would have been on the list. She opposed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and her states'-rights orientation made her antagonistic to federal court review of state criminal justice issues. I was taken aback by her first line in a 1991 majority opinion that rejected an appeal from an inmate on Virginia's death row. ""This is a case about federalism,"" she declared. Justice Marshall dissented.And yet. By the time of her own retirement in 2006, Justice O'Connor was in a very different place. She wrote the majority opinion that preserved <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in university admissions. She modulated her views on federalism. It would be ridiculous to ascribe Justice O'Connor's migration in late middle age solely to the influence of Justice Marshall, who died in 1993. But it would be equally ridiculous to discount his influence entirely. Why not take her at her word? She must have sensed something in 1992, a pull in a different direction.Could President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, assuming her confirmation, inspire any of her new colleagues to see the world in a different way?There doesn't seem to be a Sandra Day O'Connor lurking within today's carefully constructed conservative supermajority, and the heroic trajectory of Thurgood Marshall's life is not Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's story. It's fair to say that she has more in common with the justice she has been named to replace. Like Stephen Breyer, she was a star student at an excellent public high school. Her father, like his, worked as a lawyer for a big-city school board (Miami in her case, San Francisco in his). Success at Harvard Law School propelled them both to a Supreme Court clerkship (in fact, she clerked for him). Justice Breyer is often referred to as the father of the federal sentencing guidelines and served on the original United States Sentencing Commission, where she later served as vice chair.In drawing these parallels, I have deliberately not emphasized race. Yes, her nomination fulfills the president's campaign promise to appoint a Black woman, the first to sit on the Supreme Court. While that's cause for celebration, it shouldn't obscure the other kinds of diversity she would bring to the court.Diversity has many dimensions, perspective among them. That she would be the first former public defender to sit on the court has received wide notice, less so the fact that as a public school graduate she would be a rarity among the justices. Justice Breyer's departure will leave only two, Elena Kagan, who attended the highly selective Hunter College High School in Manhattan, hardly a typical public school, and Samuel Alito, who went to Steinert High School in Hamilton Township, N.J., near Trenton, his hometown. Every other member of the court is a graduate of a Catholic high school, a striking but little-observed fact at a time when cases concerning public and religious schools and the relationship between the two are prominent on the court's docket.Justice Breyer's wife, Joanna, is a clinical psychologist who during her active career specialized in working with children being treated for cancer at the Lahey Clinic in Boston. Does having a medical professional in the family account for Justice Breyer's emphasis on facts and evidence in his opinions on medical subjects? With medical questions hardly about to disappear from the court's docket, it's worth noting that Judge Jackson's husband, Patrick, is a surgeon. (Justice Sonia Sotomayor's brother, Juan, is a doctor with an allergy practice in upstate New York.) Some conservative justices seem to assume that doctors don't act in the interest of their patients, whether performing abortions or administering vaccines. Maybe Judge Jackson will be able to persuade them otherwise.Or maybe not, but my point is that we cheat ourselves out of a full appreciation of what a person brings to the court if race is our only focus. On the day of Judge Jackson's nomination, Curt Levey, president of the right-wing interest group Committee for Justice, put out a statement that was as preposterous as it was predictable. ""Jackson should be asked about her views on race,"" the statement said, adding that ""at a time when a major <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> case is on the Supreme Court's docket and our nation is debating whether equality or equity should be the governing anti-discrimination standard, we hope that senators will ask Judge Jackson about her views on equity, racial preferences, disparate impact and the like.""Maybe it's only white nominees who are not expected to answer questions about pending cases. Maybe I missed other news releases from the Committee for Justice, but I don't remember Mr. Levey asking senators to drill down on the views on racial issues held by President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court nominees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Don't white Supreme Court nominees also have a race?Thurgood Marshall, born into segregation in 1908, was already a Supreme Court justice when Ketanji Brown was born 62 years later. She will walk through the doors that he opened. But her life story is not without power. She thrived at an integrated high school -- most public schools in the United States remain racially segregated -- where she was class president and a star debater, despite the lowered expectations that white administrators had for her.Her parents attended historically Black colleges, building a solid middle-class life for their children's future. Her teenage dream was to be a judge. By 2012, when the country had a president determined to diversify the federal courts, Judge Jackson had walked through every open door and was ready for Barack Obama.It's a quintessentially American success story. Thinking about what her role on the court might be, is it fanciful to suppose that some of her colleagues, age mates who checked the same boxes on their way to the top, might look at Ketanji Brown Jackson and see themselves? Perhaps in the very familiarity of her path to the Supreme Court -- a story that to others might look extraordinary -- might lie its ability to inspire, or at least to prompt conservatives who are sure of what they think to think again. No, I don't expect her to change the court. But she may well change the conversation, and that's a start.The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

659c08d2e6e913c0e383da68	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421978637.xml.txt	"<div><p>Rehnquist's Mixed Legacy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sixteen men have served as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Some, like Melville W. Fuller, who presided from 1888 to 1910, inhabit the shadows of the court's history. Others, possessed of deeply held views and blessed with longevity or a favorable political wind at their backs, have touched Americans more profoundly than many presidents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fourth chief, John Marshall, was the first to leave his mark. It will surprise many people to learn that nothing in the Constitution explicitly authorizes the Supreme Court to decide whether acts of Congress are constitutional. In Marbury vs. Madison, Marshall deduced this power from the structure of government that the Constitution created -- and thus he created the institution of judicial review. More than a century later, Chief Justice Earl Warren led his colleagues to apply constitutional principles to outlaw racial segregation and to expand the rights of criminal defendants. Racial equality and the right to a lawyer may seem like obvious constitutional principles today; they didn't before Warren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When William H. Rehnquist joined the Supreme Court in 1972, he had ambitions that were similar in size but different in substance. Did he succeed? After 33 years on the court, the last 19 as its leader, Rehnquist's record is mixed. The Rehnquist court has slowed the expansion of civil rights but has not reversed it in most areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Victim of Cancer</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief justice has cancer and is mostly working from home. This comes after years of rumors that back troubles would force his resignation. The cancer diagnosis last fall intensified predictions of his impending retirement and sparked new discussions of his legacy and the court's future direction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist found his politics early, in dinner-table discussions with his Milwaukee parents and, after Pearl Harbor, as a neighborhood block captain responsible for reporting ""subversive activities"" to the police. His interest in history, forged in high school reenactments of the nation's founding, has endured in his writings, on the bench and off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those writings, Rehnquist will often hearken back to the period after the Civil War. Many think of the Reconstruction era as one of brutal repression of minorities and a pinched view of the federal government. Rehnquist, however, finds his legal and ideological touchstones in those years: states' rights, a narrow view of congressional authority and a bone-deep skepticism about the notion that law should protect private behavior. As a Supreme Court clerk, Rehnquist wrote memos urging his boss, Justice Robert H. Jackson, to dissent in voting-rights and school desegregation cases. Young Rehnquist scornfully dismissed pleas from criminal defendants. When Rehnquist became a justice himself, he took his own advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist has been least successful in the realm of private behavior. The abortion rights decision, Roe vs. Wade, came a year after he joined the court, and the core of that decision stands three decades later, despite Rehnquist's fierce opposition. The constitutional ban on school prayer also remains. Rehnquist's years saw the court uphold laws forbidding consensual sex among homosexuals and, over his objection, then saw the court reverse itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has had his successes. Rehnquist pushed the court to narrow or reverse many protections the Warren court had declared for criminal suspects, prisoners, racial minorities and students, boosting the authority of police, prosecutors, prison wardens and school officials. He and his colleagues struck down New Deal-era federal laws on the grounds that even the commerce clause of the Constitution -- formerly an all-purpose authority for the use of federal power -- did not authorize them. The Rehnquist court struck down laws concerning gun control, sexual assaults and cigarettes on this basis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States' Rights Booster</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sovereign authority of the states, by contrast, got a boost from Rehnquist. States are now largely free to execute murderers, destroy some inland wetlands and ponds, demote state employees who develop breast cancer or lock up some petty thieves for life, as California has chosen to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stopwatch efficiency that has earned Rehnquist high marks as the court's manager is also evident in his often-sparse opinions. Here it has not served him or the court as well. Instead of articulating principles that can guide judges and lawmakers, Rehnquist has often focused on the facts at hand. Your guess is as good as a constitutional scholar's about how the court will rule on any given <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> program. Why some terrorism suspects are entitled to legally challenge their confinement and others are not is similarly mysterious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist's most memorable accomplishment will probably be his most ignominious, and one of the most ""activist"" rulings in the court's history: essentially installing George W. Bush as president in the fatuously reasoned Bush vs. Gore. In the years before 2000, the Rehnquist court had rejected equal-protection claims from death row inmates complaining of racial bias, California homeowners challenging wide disparities in the property tax, gays and lesbians who wanted to serve in the military, and so on. But the same justices found that George W. Bush was a victim of an injustice worthy of the court's intervention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The selection of Rehnquist's successor, whenever it happens, will be a high-stakes battle. Both sides believe that important precedents, Roe among them, now hang on one vote. Rehnquist's replacement with another conservative may not much change the court's balance, but with eight of the nine justices over 65, the next vacancy could occur soon, allowing Bush to shift the court sharply right and finish the job Rehnquist started.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

An F1 career blasts off</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lewis Hamilton is more than just Formula One's first black driver. We could be witnessing the arrival of a Tiger Woods on wheels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hamilton, 22, is off to the best start ever for an F1 rookie-- ever!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And at the highest level of automobile racing in the world, he's in some serious historical company: Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Jackie Stewart, Emerson Fittipaldi, Jimmy Clark . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His breakthrough victory could come as soon as Sunday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>F1 is abuzz with the numerology of Hamilton's onslaught: third in the season-opening Grand Prix of Australia, second last Sunday in Malaysia, so why not first in Bahrain this weekend?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When he wins may be a matter of when his McLaren-Mercedes team gives him the green light to go all out. So far he has been following F1 protocol for a junior driver, which is to defer to the senior teammate--in this case Fernando Alonso, who at 25 has won world championships the last two years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You have to understand the subtleties of F1 to get the entire meaning of what Hamilton said to his team via radio last Sunday, seconds after completing one of the most captivating second-place drives by anyone, rookie or not, in memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The radio transmission was uplinked to the world by satellite TV.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I want to win,"" Hamilton said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, of course he does. But you could read that not as a simple expression of ambition, but as a request to McLaren team boss Ron Dennis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Doesn't matter if it's the next race,"" Hamilton continued in the accent of his birthplace, England. ""But sometime this year, I'm going to have one.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider Hamilton's Malaysian drive:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He started fourth, but quickly, artfully, slipped past both Ferraris--better, quicker cars than his McLaren--into second place, falling in behind teammate Alonso, who had jumped from second into the lead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From there, Hamilton's job was not to challenge Alonso, but to fight a defensive action to hold off the favored Ferraris so Alonso could get away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Hamilton did, all race, in electrifying ways at times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Felipe Massa--whom Ferrari deems its rising star--tried three times to get around Hamilton. Three times Hamilton darted back ahead, making Massa look worse each time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I was able to trick him,"" Hamilton said afterward in an uplinked news conference, ""into out-braking himself, to the point that he went off [into the grass, on the third try].</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I apologize for that,"" Hamilton said, and then smiled with polite ruthlessness. ""But we have the points, so it doesn't really matter.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With 14 season points, Hamilton is third in the world championship standings, only four behind leader Alonso. That's the highest standing ever for a rookie at this point in a season. Only one other driver, Peter Arundel in 1964, scored podium finishes in his first two starts--a pair of thirds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Later in the Malaysian race Hamilton held off Kimi Raikkonen, widely considered the quickest driver in the world now that Schumacher has retired, in the other Ferrari. Alonso won easily because Hamilton fought the war. That's how it works in F1. But Hamilton was more impressive than his world-champion teammate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is but a touch of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in Hamilton's story-- just enough to be fair in the unspeakably expensive world of international formula racing. He has taken it from there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His father, Anthony Hamilton, born in England to immigrants from Grenada, bought Lewis a go-kart when he was 8. The youngster was so good that by age 13 he was signed to a developmental contract by McLaren's Dennis and Mercedes-Benz racing director Norbert Haug.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By 2005, Hamilton was making Dennis and Haug look prescient, dominating the F3 Euroseries with 15 victories and 13 poles. Then last year he soared through the GP2 series, the final stepping stone to F1, winning the championship on his first try.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Hamilton still might be waiting in the pipeline of the McLaren-Mercedes system if not for an ironic twist to what NASCAR considered its greatest coup yet toward driver diversity: the defection of Colombian star Juan Pablo Montoya from F1.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most monumental aspect of Montoya's move may turn out to be that it left a seat open at McLaren: the one Hamilton has filled so dazzlingly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ehinton@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: Lewis Hamilton gleefully displays his second-place trophy in Malaysia last Sunday.

Nonetheless, liberals shouldn't pretend that academia is untouched by political prejudices. Conservatives do face some bias and are wildly underrepresented in the social sciences; enough, perhaps, to warrant new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a recent study, only 6.6% of professors in the social sciences self-identify as Republicans (compared with 24.2% in business, 23.3% in engineering, and 22.9% in the health sciences). In sociology, Marxists outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1. Conservative professors are, then, less well represented in the social sciences than women and people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This imbalance is partly attributable to the fact that conservative students steer clear of the social sciences well before they consider graduate programs. One study found that students' politics is among the very best predictors of their undergraduate major choice, with conservatives tending to select the natural sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's possible that these conservative undergraduates simply prefer the natural sciences -- some evidence, for example, suggests that they are slightly more focused on financial success than are liberals. But it's also germane that conservatives feel uncomfortable in classes that touch on politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A climate survey conducted by the University of Colorado found that Republican students were more than three times as likely as their Democratic peers to feel intimidated when sharing their political ideas in class. Another study found that students active in campus conservative groups avoid coursework in the social sciences -- an especially striking discovery given these students' self-evidently strong interest in social and political issues. A third study found that conservatives report less satisfaction with their coursework in the social sciences than do liberal students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've also found that right-leaning PhD students seem to avoid the most politicized subfields in the social sciences. One young political scientist, for example, told us that she would have preferred to study the Middle East, but opted for a safer subfield instead: ""I didn't do the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which was the thing I wanted to do."" As one professor of the ancient world -- a safe subfield in history -- explained more generally: ""If you're a conservative, there [are] such huge no-go zones.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one exception -- that proves the rule -- is economics. Economics has a long history of openness to thinkers on both sides of the political divide and is the one social science field that actually looks like America; it has roughly equal proportions of professors who identify as Republicans, independents and Democrats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Academic sorting is especially troubling given that the university is one of the only institutions that could model civil discourse for young people in our polarized age, an example that is hard to provide with so few conservatives about. Additionally, a growing number of social scientists are recognizing that political homogeneity makes it hard for humanistic disciplines to converge on the best approximation of the truth; homogenous fields not only generate a narrower range of research interests and interpretations, they are also plagued by confirmation bias -- our tendency to accept findings and theories that fit our assumptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One liberal argument for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is sympathetic to these very points. In his 1978 opinion on Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. noted that truth is discovered ""out of a multitude of tongues."" (He was quoting an earlier decision on another topic.) If Justice Powell is right -- if the primary purpose of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is to increase the variety of tongues -- then we should increase conservative ones too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some might reasonably object that the real purpose of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is to remedy historical discrimination. Universities, however, have long emphasized the virtues of diversity over remedial justice. In fact, liberals embraced the diversity rationale in the 1970s partly because it allowed them to extend <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> to new groups -- especially women -- with far weaker historical grievances than African Americans. Today, universities are so committed to diversity -- not remedial justice -- that they are now practicing <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for men so that their campuses don't become even more dominated by female students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity is now the new religion of the university -- and it's one they could practice much better. We don't endorse preferences in graduate admissions and hiring. At a bare minimum, however, universities should stop barring conservative speakers from their campuses. In just the past year, for example, Williams College disinvited two conservative speakers from its ""uncomfortable learning"" series.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In hiring committees, liberal faculty might also question their natural preference for like-minded colleagues. (Progressive professors often say that they prefer to hire liberals, all else being equal.) Before they start sorting through resumes, departments might consider advertising positions in fields that are more popular among conservatives, such as military history, political history, the American founding, sociology of religion and natural law. Scholars in such fields would bring some balance to a curriculum increasingly dominated by race and gender. Finally, universities could grant visiting appointments in conservative thought, an experiment already underway at the University of Colorado.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even these modest reforms should help conservative feel much more welcome in all of academia, not just in some of its quarters. When that happens, the university will also deepen its public legitimacy -- an increasingly rare and fragile good in our polarized age. But that fine achievement depends critically on liberals. As conservative professors, we have defended the progressive university against its polemical right-wing critics. Now we are asking the university to better practice what it preaches.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jon A.

659c08d2e6e913c0e383da68	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2761519572.xml.txt	"<div><p>What Went Unsaid in the Chief Justice’s Report on the Judiciary</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, recently filed his 2022 “year-end report on the federal judiciary.” It’s more interesting for what it didn’t say than for what it did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To underscore the threatening world that judges occupy, the chief justice began by focusing on a pivotal moment in the desegregation of the nation’s schools. The 1957 attempt by the Arkansas governor Orval Faubus to block Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School led to threats of violence against the federal judge who enforced the court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. That judge, Ronald N. Davies, was “uncowed,” the chief justice wrote, despite being “physically threatened.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“A judicial system cannot and should not live in fear,” Chief Justice Roberts added as he thanked Congress for passing a law last year to protect judges. The new law was named in honor of Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, who was murdered in 2020 in an assault meant for the judge at her home. The law screens from the public the personal information of federal judges and their families, including identifiers such as license plate numbers and addresses. Leaders like the chief justice deserve praise when they highlight the dangers all public officials now face.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Focusing on the Brown decision was nonetheless surprising. After all, the court appears poised to reverse a decision upholding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in school admissions, one of the very remedies that the Brown decision spawned, and which all nine members of the court stood squarely behind in 1954 and reaffirmed in a subsequent case in 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, the chief justice sometimes used his year-end report to describe substantive reforms in the federal courts, like the task force created in 2018 in response to allegations that federal judges had harassed their staffs sexually and in other ways. Not so in his latest report, which was four pages long with a five-page appendix. Chief Justice Roberts did not mention any of the many issues that made the news about the court last year — the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices whose actions or those of family members raise questions about impartiality, the leak of a draft of the court’s decision overturning abortion rights, the insufficiency of financial disclosure and questions about fund-raising for the Supreme Court Historical Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor did the chief justice explore the troubling data in his report’s appendix on “the workload of the courts.” The numbers document a sharp decline of the use of the federal courts. Federal appellate filings fell again in the fiscal year 2022, a steady decline from 49,000 in 2018 to fewer than 42,000 last year. Trial-level civil cases in the federal district courts have fallen precipitously as well — down from more almost 283,000 cases in 2018 to about 240,000 in 2022.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In calculating totals and the trend in civil cases, court administrators did not include about 321,000 filings that, starting in 2020, were brought by military service members and veterans who claimed that combat earplugs sold by 3M to the U.S. military were faulty. Under a federal statute, those cases became, in effect, one litigation, consolidated before trial in front of a single judge, and they are an example of the importance of people having access to courts, which can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The opinions of the very court that the chief justice leads provide insight into the decline. We know from our own experience that savvy civil rights lawyers now steer clear of federal court. Winning in the appellate courts risks having the Supreme Court’s conservative majority extinguish any gains won for women, prisoners, the environment and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dwindling numbers of filings at the trial level in the U.S. District Courts also derive in part from what the Supreme Court has done during the last few decades — to close the courthouse doors to many would-be litigants, in class-action lawsuits and other cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key example can be found in the court’s interpretations of the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In a series of cases that began in the 1980s, the court has read the statute to mean that employers and businesses can include arbitration clauses in lengthy, dense, fine-print documents with consumers and employees that bar access to courts and to class actions. Even complaints of violations of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and of federal laws regulating securities, fair credit, unlawful mergers and unfair business practices can be forced into arbitration rather than being litigated in court. Anyone aggrieved has to go, one by one, to private arbitration. In practice, almost none do, because most people don’t have the resources to pursue small-value claims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, the veterans in the combat earplug cases were able to get into court because no arbitration mandate kept them out. And once in court, because of procedures designed to make group-based litigation easier, they could combine resources to pursue their arguments of hearing loss and tinnitus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The “state of the judiciary” address is a bully pulpit constructed decades ago by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Given the challenges the country faces, we need a chief justice who helps us all talk seriously about what ails the federal courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts’s focus on 1950s desegregation litigation is a poignant reminder that once federal courts led the way in protecting civil rights and making courts accessible to all. His court, however, has made plain it has no interest in opening doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that, we need Congress to reinvigorate federal rights and end the power of would-be defendants to control access. That’s what Congress did in 2022 when it amended the 1925 arbitration statute to let victims of sexual assault and harassment decide if they want to sue in court rather than consider using arbitration. The chief justice properly commended Congress for making strides in protecting federal judges. Now Congress needs to protect and support the right to bring cases to those judges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nancy Gertner, a retired Federal District Court judge, is a senior lecturer in law at Harvard Law School.

It's an experiment providing a ""universal basic income,"" or UBI, to low-income Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In conjunction with the Marin Community Foundation, which plans to contribute $3 million to the effort, the Marin County Board of Supervisors has allocated $400,000 in public funds for the experiment. The program is similar to one recently completed in Stockton, Calif., but one major difference sets the Marin experiment apart: race and sex discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Stockton UBI experiment provided payments to 125 residents of neighborhoods at or below Stockton's median household income. The Marin regime will do the same, but beneficiaries must be ""mothers of color."" That term is undefined, but it's clear that fathers and white mothers are ineligible to participate. A similar race-based scheme has been announced in Oakland, Calif.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter what one thinks of UBI as a policy matter, the use of public funds in the Marin scheme is legally dubious. The California Constitution's equal-protection clause, like the federal one in the 14th Amendment, applies ""strict scrutiny""—the highest possible level of judicial scrutiny—to racial classifications. California courts, unlike federal ones, also apply strict scrutiny to sex classifications. In Connerly v. State Personnel Board (2001), a California appeals court made that clear in invalidating both race- and sex-based <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If I had grown up in Marin County under its proposed UBI regime, my family would have been ineligible to participate. I grew up poor and at times homeless or living in public housing projects. But my mother, who is white, was raising her three black children on her own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin Community Foundation's chief executive, Thomas Peters, has said that ""this first cohort will focus on low-income moms of color"" because they face ""the greatest aggregate of challenges: low income, young children and facing the daily travails and insults of overt and covert racial discrimination.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My mother was low-income, had three young children and faced racial discrimination. We lived in black communities where black men were stigmatized for consorting with white women, and that stigma flowed to those women and their biracial children.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If my mother was somehow privileged over similarly situated black mothers, it could only have been by the slimmest possible margin. To exclude someone like her from a public-assistance program on account of her skin color is the very definition of racial injustice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin UBI scheme threatens to drive the wedge of racial discord currently tearing wildly through our social fabric even deeper. And frankly, policies with good intentions such as UBI, which might conceivably help to address the intractable problem of poverty, will be tainted with the scarlet R of racism and the understandable suspicion of being a pretense for reparative racial justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Westhill is president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marin County's Discriminatory 'Universal Basic Income'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Devon Westhill</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

Unfamiliar with the surroundings in the dark, he bonks his head on the refrigerator and is out cold for three and a half years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When he opens his eyes in 1992, refreshed after his long rest, he sees the face of White House chief of staff John Sununu peering down at him. Mr. Bush's first words are ''How fares the nation?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Everything is in great shape,'' Mr. Sununu reports. ''Peace, prosperity without inflation, the kinder-gentler thing doing fine. One of Millie's grandpuppies just had her first litter, and the Post Office is delivering the announcement cards.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The President warily asks for specifics: ''How much does it cost to mail a letter from Washington to California?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Same as last year,'' shrugs Sununu, ''300 yen.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To discover if such complacency is rampant at the center of power, and to track down the source of a troubling new phrase, I visited Governor Sununu in his West Wing office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is, as they say, sharp. When I recalled hours spent in that corner office with a previous occupant, and added wistfully, ''Say what you like about Haldeman, nobody ever ran into his motorcades,'' Mr. Sununu smiled and replied, ''I'll mention that to Cheney.'' He had caught the obscure allusion to inept Presidential motorcading during the Ford Administration when Dick Cheney was chief of staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, he is still insecure and wet behind his White House ears. In our interview, which was on foreground, he had his deputy sit in to take notes, sign of a player new to the big leagues and fearful of being misquoted. He had his secretary rush in with a message about being late for a meeting with the President, which he waved off to flatter his visitor but also to impress him with the value of the time being taken up. That hoary heave-ho technique is known to Oval Officiators as ''the 10-minute bounce.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about the perception of leisureliness in governance, the near-palindromic aide offered a fresh metaphor to explain the failure to understand the Bush approach: ''Ours is a different template.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Translation: You can no longer use the Reagan template on the keyboard of power. (A template in this sense is a plastic instruction sheet cut out to overlay the computer's keys.) The Bush template reflects a different processing system: if you hold down Alt and push F9, you will now get conciliation where you used to get confrontation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I take this to mean, for example, that the deal made with Speaker Wright to keep the contras fed while giving a policy veto on Nicaragua to Congress would be an unprincipled cave-in on the Reagan template, but is a net pragmatic gain on the Bush template.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief of staff ''had a little chat with'' Boyden Gray about the way the President's counsel, shut out of that Baker-Sununu-Scowcroft project, objected publicly. I think Mr. Gray was right in trying to stop an evisceration of Presidential power, but Mr. Sununu disagrees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was not trapped by what was artfully presented as a linguistic question. The phrase enhanced rescission is being whispered in the corridors of power. Sounds like a tricky euphemism; what does it mean?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''It's an alternative to the line-item veto,'' he said, suggesting Bob Dole as the best source about that, I presume to avoid letting it appear to be an executive initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The power to impound - to not spend - funds appropriated by Congress was taken away from a weakened President in 1974; Mr. Reagan's counterattack, the line-item veto, never had a chance of passage. That leaves a middle ground of ''rescission,'' or getting Congress to agree to rescind parts of appropriations, to be ''enhanced'' by making unnecessary the current affirmative legislative action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The upshot would be a substantial giveback of executive authority, as evidence that the Tower appointment precedent and the contra-veto usurpation were not waves of the future. It would show, too, that the Bush White House was effectively at work behind the scenes, progressing without grandstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will Mr. Sununu and budgeteer Dick Darman win this for President Bush? I don't see how, if their standard becomes a white feather on a flapping doormat, but for my different template, I am willing to plunk down about 300 yen.</p></div>		stance:::None/Not Discussed

In that opinion, she wrote that the court “expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.” Driver argues that the years remaining on the clock that started with Grutter could offer public and private institutions of higher learning a way to adapt to race-neutral admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In another essay last week, Linda Greenhouse, who reported on the Supreme Court for The Times from 1978 to 2008, casts the upcoming oral arguments as evidence that the meaning of Brown v.

659c08d2e6e913c0e383da68	test_question_pro_testing_1	"<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

But this gives them too much credit. It implies they have a starting team. Not these days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bench is where players are stashed who can step in for the first team--for a governor, a U.S. senator, a state attorney general. . . . The GOP currently has none of these top positions. Democrats occupy the governor's office, both U.S. Senate seats and five of seven statewide partisan offices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of two statewide elected Republicans--Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush--has suffered a potential career-ending scandal. Scratch him as a future governor. The other--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Secretary of State Bill Jones--angered major GOP campaign contributors by defecting to Sen. John McCain after having committed to Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Jones is now on the political disabled list.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is one healthy player, and he's not exactly a bench warmer. He's the new state Senate minority leader, Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte, 44, is the most politically savvy, articulate Republican in the Legislature. Indeed, it's tough to think of a Republican throughout California who commands more respect among politicians of either party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""He makes things happen in the Capitol,"" notes GOP consultant Ray McNally. ""And he does it without surrendering his conservative principles. Without selling out.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte's first political job was slapping on bumper strips for gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan as a 10-year-old. Eventually, he became an advance man for Vice President George Bush, worked for several politicians and was elected to the Assembly in 1990.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Quickly rising to Republican leader, Brulte orchestrated the GOP's ""takeover"" of the Assembly in 1994. But three Republicans sold out to Democrat Willie Brown and Brulte was denied the speakership. In 1996, he moved to the Senate, became GOP caucus chairman and, when Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine stepped down as minority leader for family health reasons last week, Brulte succeeded him without a fight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's now his responsibility to improve the GOP's 25-15 disadvantage in the Senate--or at least keep the scarce seats the party holds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What drives Brulte is political conquest and legislative compromise, not any ideological cause. He brings to the arena congeniality. ""I don't provoke people,"" notes the 6-foot, 4-inch, 260- pound GOP leader.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That means less legislative gridlock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's not one to hang up a budget over, say, abortion funding. In truth, no recent GOP leader has, partly due to Brulte's coaxing. He's basically antiabortion but tries to avoid the divisive issue. Same with gun control; he mostly votes against it, but cautions Republicans that they are on the wrong side of history on firearms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked how his party got to this low point, Brulte replies: ""It allowed itself to be painted as intolerant. It picked issues that tended to divide rather than to unite. And we're now [in the Senate] trying to focus on issues that unite.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Issues like school accountability, lower college fees, transportation planning. He won't get into the errant, divisive issues--abortion, illegal immigration, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte has his own <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program: He pumped $400,000 from his political kitty into the winning primary campaigns of Republican women and minorities. ""I wanted to send a signal that at the highest level of the party, we're prepared to put our money where our mouth is,"" he says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An optimist, Brulte professes not to worry about the GOP's future in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Conventional wisdom is historically wrong,"" he says. ""Three years ago, Gray Davis was pretty much derided. Today he's governor. . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Perception always trails reality. And the Republican Party was in trouble long before people recognized it. We're still in trouble, but we're better off than people think.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The party is financially better off since Brulte became its finance chairman last fall. It was $300,000 in debt; now it has more than $1 million in the bank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Considered Bush's point man in California, Brulte recruited the candidate for a $2-million-plus party fund-raising dinner. This week, Bush is in California again raising another $2 million for the state and national parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Says Gov. Davis' chief strategist, Garry South: ""I think the world of Brulte. We're honest with each other. He's never sleazed me. I pick his brain. He picks mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""My only concern about Brulte is he's had such a meteoric rise, he's going to think the next step is running for governor.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not likely. But given their bench, Republicans could do worse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Message No: ..ACCN: 00042160</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: GRAPHIC-DRAWING: SACRAMENTO</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

But this year, Morristown also had a live-action drama showcasing those unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The action began when a white supremacist from Mississippi won the right in court to hold a rally here yesterday. Richard Barrett, whose Nationalist Movement oath declares ''the white race is the superlative civilizer,'' said he chose Morristown because of its history. Just as George Washington ''said no to the privileges of the king, today we're saying no to the privileges of minorities,'' he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett got what he wanted yesterday -- helmeted police protecting his right to march on Washington Street, a crowd of angry counter-protesters that drew pepper spray and 10 arrests. A perfect forum for a man with bullhorn and bombast. Mr. Barrett brought to town an anemic anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> protest and a racist version of the Declaration of Independence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But on Monday night, as Mr. Barrett prepared to deliver his divisive message, Morristown made its elegant statement. About 1,000 people filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't have done it without him. ''We are here tonight to reject any notion that one race is superior to another,'' Calvary's pastor, the Rev. Jerry Carter, said to cheers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The service and a candlelight march to the Morristown Green were arranged at the urging of the mayor, John J. DeLaney Jr., who was looking for a way to counter Mr. Barrett without giving him the satisfaction of a confrontation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The town has about 17,000 residents --  about 15 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic -- and just around the corner from Calvary church is evidence that all is not harmonious. Outside a house, a sign commemorates the death of a black resident who was killed last year by the police in a neighboring town. Prosecutors cleared the officers, but, for some, his death remains an example of racial profiling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MONDAY night, though, was a display of racial accord. Rabbi David Nesson of Morristown's Jewish Community Center reminded the crowd that Washington once wrote to a synagogue in Newport, R.I., that one of the country's guiding ideals was ''to give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jakki Dumas-Footman, 33, a financial analyst, said she felt compelled to come to the service with her daughter even though she grew up black in a largely white Morristown neighborhood and rarely felt racism. ''I've never seen a K.K.K. march,'' she said. ''I brought my daughter. She knows about the K.K.K. I want her to see it. This is our history, in a way.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nate Moore, a 58-year-old computer consultant, came Monday night remembering that history from having grown up black in Alabama. Mr. Barrett's message ''really astounded me,'' he said. ''I really thought these days were passed.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The songs of equality at the church recalled the old days, Mr. Moore said, but there were more white faces in the pews,  and the ranks of racists were thinner. ''I think you have to accept the differences and move on,'' he said. ''I think that's what we're doing more of -- accepting the differences and moving on.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But moving on is not a straight course.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monday night's harmony gave way to yesterday's ugliness. Mr. Barrett's sad parade of eight followers was separated from an angry crowd of about 250 by barricades and helmeted police on horses. At the height of the event, protesters from groups including the Progressive Labor Party were hurling vile taunts at the police as some protesters knocked down barricades and threw golf balls and batteries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asa Watkins, an 83-year-old artist from Morristown, had come to oppose Mr. Barrett, but was taken aback by the anger on both sides.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Watkins was reminded that Washington had spent two treacherous winters in Morristown on the way to victory. This Fourth of July freedom had another tough, but victorious, round in Morristown. ''It's a messy process, democracy is,'' said Mr. Watkins, leaving the rally. ''It always is.''</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

It is too painful to look at. Reality is too hard to accept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mental health experts routinely say that denial is among the most common defense mechanisms. Denial is how the person defends his superior sense of self, her racially unequal society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Denial is how America defends itself as superior to “shithole countries” in Africa and elsewhere, as President Trump reportedly described them in a White House meeting last week, although he has since, well, denied that. It’s also how America defends itself as superior to those “developing countries” in Africa, to quote how liberal opponents of Mr. Trump might often describe them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump appears to be unifying America — unifying Americans in their denial. The more racist Mr. Trump sounds, the more Trump country denies his racism, and the more his opponents look away from their own racism to brand Trump country as racist. Through it all, America remains a unified country of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reckoning of Mr. Trump’s racism must become the reckoning of American racism. Because the American creed of denial — “I’m not a racist” — knows no political parties, no ideologies, no colors, no regions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, affirmed that Mr. Trump did use the term “shithole” during a White House meeting on immigration with lawmakers. Mr. Durbin rightfully described Mr. Trump’s words as “hate-filled, vile and racist,” and added, “I cannot believe that in the history of the White House in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Trump is no exception. In framing Mr. Trump’s racism as exceptional, in seeking to highlight the depth of the president’s cruelty, Mr. Durbin, a reliably liberal senator, showed the depth of denial of American racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Begin with the eight presidents who held slaves while in the Oval Office. Then consider how Abraham Lincoln urged black people to leave the United States. “Even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race,” Lincoln told five black guests at the White House in 1862. So “it is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raging then as we are raging now, the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison responded, “Can anything be more puerile, absurd, illogical, impertinent, untimely?” He added that “had it not been for the cupidity of their white enslavers, not one of their race would now be found upon this continent.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Presidential history also includes the social Darwinism of Theodore Roosevelt, the federal-government-segregating, “Birth of a Nation”-praising Woodrow Wilson — and the bigotry that came from the mouths of presidents who are generally seen as essential to racial progress. President Lyndon B. Johnson said “nigger” nearly as often as Ku Klux Klansmen did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism. Where there is suffering from racist policies, there are denials that those policies are racist. The beat of denial sounds the same across time and space.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up to the beat of racist denial in Queens, not far from where Mr. Trump grew up. I was raised in the urban “hell” of neighborhoods he probably avoided, alongside immigrants from countries he derided last week. In school or elsewhere, we all heard recitals of the American ideal of equality, especially on the day we celebrate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Those events often feature recitals of the words “all men are created equal,” which were written by a slaveholder who once declared that black people “are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thomas Jefferson was not a founding father of equality. He was a founding father of the heartbeat of denial that lives through both Mr. Trump’s denials and the assertion that his racial views are abnormal for America and its presidents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fifty years ago, Richard Nixon transformed this historic heartbeat of denial into an intoxicating political philosophy. His presidential candidacy appealed to George Wallace-type segregationists while also attracting Americans who refused to live near “dangerous” black residents, obstructed the desegregation of schools, resisted <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies, framed black mothers on welfare as undeserving, called the black family pathological and denigrated black culture — all those racists who refused to believe they were racist in 1968.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nixon designed his campaign, one of his advisers explained, to allow a potential supporter to “avoid admitting to himself that he was attracted by” the “racist appeal.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new vocabulary emerged, allowing users to evade admissions of racism. It still holds fast after all these years. The vocabulary list includes these: law and order. War on drugs. Model minority. Reverse discrimination. Race-neutral. Welfare queen. Handout. Tough on crime. Personal responsibility. Black-on-black crime. Achievement gap. No excuses. Race card. Colorblind. Post-racial. Illegal immigrant. Obamacare. War on Cops. Blue Lives Matter. All Lives Matter. Entitlements. Voter fraud. Economic anxiety.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The denials using these phrases come from both conservatives and white liberals who think people of color are stuck in cycles of unstable families and criminal cultures, and that the deprivations of poverty and discrimination spin out bad people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump opened his candidacy with racism, calling Mexicans criminals and rapists. Since taking office, he has looked away from the disaster zone in Puerto Rico, he has called some violent white supremacists “very fine people,” and he has described Nigerians as living in “huts .”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When someone identifies the obvious, Mr. Trump resounds the beat of denial as he did before he was president: “I’m the least racist person that you’ve ever met ,” that “you’ve ever seen ,” that “you’ve ever encountered .”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are ugly denials. But it’s the denials from those who stand in strong opposition to this president that are more frustrating to me: denials that their attacks on identity politics are racist. Denials that the paltry number of people of color in elite spaces marks racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those denials echo the same ones that frustrated Dr. King in 1963 as he sat in a Birmingham jail cell and wrote , “Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, I suspect, will go to his grave with his heart beating in denial of the ill will of racism. Many others will as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because we naturally want to look away from our ugliness. We paint over racist reality to make a beautiful delusion of self, of society. We defend this beautiful self and society from our racist reality with the weapons of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Denial is fueled by the stigma associated with being a racist. Feeding the stigma is how “racist” is considered almost like an identity, a brand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a racist is not who a person is. A racist is what a person is, what a person is saying, what a person is doing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Racist is not a fixed category like “not racist,” which is steeped denial. Only racists say they are not racist. Only the racist lives by the heartbeat of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The antiracist lives by the opposite heartbeat, one that rarely and irregularly sounds in America — the heartbeat of confession.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/opinion/sunday/heartbeat-of-racism-denial.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: IBRAM X.

Some, we discovered, acted as conduits for CIA subsidies to civic and educational organizations and subsidized the publication of various books and magazines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was all part of the Cold War against the Soviet Union, although many recipients of the agency's cash didn't know that and didn't know their patron. Not much came from these disclosures. The parties promised to sin no more and before long, the affair had faded into the misty regions of memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media turned to other pursuits and today, as Nicholas Lemann writes in the Atlantic Monthly, ""The press, which pays close attention to politics and government through deeply ingrained reflex, largely ignores foundations, or treats them, in a polite but faintly bored tone, as innocuous do-gooders rather than significant actors.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our interest in these institutions flickered briefly a couple of years ago when conservative elements in Congress started asking questions and proposing legislation to curb the political activities of foundations and the thousands of tax-exempt special interest groups that have spread like kudzu during the past 25 years. They now occupy a respectable share of the available office space in Washington. The ""public interests"" they represent range from the World Association of Alcohol Beverage Industries and the Dairy Recognition Foundation to the League of Women Voters and the YMCA.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax exemption, as Lemann reminds us, is granted to foundations and their ""public interest"" cousins on condition that they forswear any ""attempt to influence political or legislative outcomes, except by providing technical information. This rule is violated widely. In fact, it's difficult to think of a significant policy initiative taken by the federal government or voiced in a recent presidential campaign that didn't have some foundation undergirding.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is complicated by the federal government, which provides funding to many politically active nonprofits -- the National Council of Senior Citizens, for example -- that administer various federal educational and job-training programs. Republican critics in Congress claim that through bookkeeping devices these federal grants can be misused to finance political activities. They lost the fight last year, and the subject has more or less vanished from media agendas. That is unfortunate because foundations and the ""public interest"" nonprofits are a big, influential and expanding industry. Lemann reports that during the past 15 years or so the number of foundations has nearly doubled, from 22,000 to 39,000. Their assets now exceed $200 billion, half of it controlled by fewer than 200 foundations, according to another student of the industry, Alan Reynolds of the Hudson Institute.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This wealth, he writes, represents ""enormous influence over which public policy, social program or artistic endeavor will succeed or fail."" Lemann makes a similar point. Big foundations, ""which have a distinctly liberal cast use their tax-exempt dollars to fund everything from the civil rights movement to studies supporting the expansion of the welfare state to disarmament and population control abroad."" As conservative foundations have prospered since 1980 they ""have been particularly successful in training cadres of activists and policymakers to serve their cause, by subsidizing books that change the tenor of public discourse (for example, Dinesh D'Souza's `Illiberal Education') and supplying the government with policy ideas (the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for the early Reagan Administration . . . ).""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reach of the foundations is felt in ostensibly private affairs as well. Peter Skerry, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, recalls in the Wilson Quarterly the 1994 upheaval within the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The incumbent executive director, Benjamin Chavis, was ousted. ""But it was seldom noted {in the press},"" Skerry observes, ""that his removal was instigated not by the membership but by the Ford Foundation, which withheld a major grant until the NAACP's finances were put in order. One of the few observers who did note it was Washington Post columnist William Raspberry {who asked} . . . how such a venerable organization, still 600,000 members strong, has come to the point . . . of being beholden to a private foundation for its survival?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foundations may even work through relatively hollow organizational fronts. Skerry cites the case of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) ""which seeks to represent not only all Mexican Americans but all of the nation's 27 million Latinos. This claim is widely accepted, and the organization has played a prominent role in recent debates over immigration and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Yet it has no members and gets most of its funding from corporations and foundations, especially the Ford Foundation, which played the critical role in establishing it in the late 1960s. Lacking members, MALDEF has no real bonds of accountability to the communities it strives to represent.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Kettering Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia foundation, are less well-known than the Ford or Rockefeller foundations. But they have had a significant impact on a number of nongovernmental institutions, including the American press. Their intellectual leadership and money have been largely responsible for the ""civic journalism"" movement that has been taken up by the media in more than 40 cities. The guiding principle of ""civic journalism"" is that the public, through polls and ""focus groups"" usually financed by the foundations, should play an important role in setting the news and editorial agendas of the press. Newspapers and broadcasters that have embraced the movement are generally pleased with the results.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many critics such as William Woo, former editor of the St. Louis Post Dispatch, believe the press risks its independence and credibility by aligning itself and becoming financially beholden to foundations with ""a very ideological view of America, a very definite view of the road America should take."" He puts Pew in that category.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Lemann, the broader problem is that foundations ""have no voters, no customers, no investors."" So they operate in an unexamined environment, ignored by the press and public alike. No one asks the ""main policy questions about them -- How, exactly, should their economic and political activities be restricted in return for their tax-exempt status? Does the tax exemption still make sense ?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This {isolation} ought to change. Foundations are becoming so much more significant so rapidly that they deserve to be brought into the company of central institutions whose course is the subject of constant public scrutiny and debate.""</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

A coalition of civil rights groups made the settlement possible by agreeing to pay 70 percent of the $433,500 judgment that Sharon Taxman won in a lower court for back pay and lawyers' fees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> thought that the Supreme Court, which was scheduled to hear the case in January, was likely to find the race-based layoff decision improper.

The Piscataway case was a difficult one with unusual facts. The teachers, hired the same day, had equal seniority and comparable qualifications. The school district, forced to trim staff for budget reasons, chose to keep the black teacher because she was the only black teacher in her department. The district's goal of maintaining racial diversity was honorable, but its approach was clumsy. The Clinton Administration, which first supported the action, reversed itself this summer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At some point, the Supreme Court will address whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits considering race in any employment decision, except as a remedy for actual discrimination.

Neglectful landlords. Battles over minority enrollment. In the imagination of many liberal New Yorkers, private universities like New York and Columbia are often at odds with struggling communities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's Dr. Allan J. Formicola to contradict the usual image. Retiring this month after 23 years as dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, Dr. Formicola, 61, used his position to attract minorities to the dental school and to bring high-quality dental care to Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Formicola, a man with two wings of curly salt-and-pepper hair and a warm  manner, achieved this partly through a personality that makes him as comfortable in a boardroom as on a street corner. He reached out to minority alumni, some of whom had felt isolated at the dental school. At a time of falling enrollment at dental schools nationally, he sold Columbia on encouraging new black and brown faces and more local involvement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The grandson of Italian immigrants, Dr. Formicola was only 38 when he arrived at Columbia in 1978. But his resume included a stint in the late 60's teaching at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a city infamous for its treatment of black people. He describes himself as someone who was always enamored of the ideals of the Great Society and the civil rights movement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''He's got a tremendous amount of respect from the people in Harlem,'' said Paul Dunn, vice president of Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement. ''He's a man who's had a lot of vision and a lot of commitment to bringing people together and building bridges.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia and Harlem, in particular, have had a fractious relationship. Most famously, the 1968 student protest was sparked by Columbia's plan to build a gym in Morningside Park. Recently, Columbia's Morningside Heights neighbors took the university to court over plans to build faculty housing and an elementary school on West 110th Street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dental school, founded in 1852 and incorporated into Columbia in 1917, had its own history, mostly of indifference. Only 13 blacks graduated from the the school between 1923 and 1980. Dr. Formicola helped enhance minority enrollment to the point that out of a student body of about 300, each class has 6 to 10 blacks and 6 to 8 Latinos. Also under his guidance, Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood now have three community health centers, dental clinics in seven neighborhood schools, and a van offering dental care to children and the aged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Formicola's achievements are an implicit answer to a question behind the never-ending debate about <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and other issues involving inequality: what do those in power owe those on the other end?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''It's hard to say when you're sitting in the midst of a community in need that our mission should be research and education,'' Dr. Formicola said as he sat in his immaculate office in Washington Heights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia's dental school now leads the nation in projects like community partnerships for clinics, said Dennis Mitchell-Lewis, an assistant professor at the school and the director of many of the outreach efforts. ''Dean Formicola has changed everything,'' Dr. Mitchell-Lewis said. ''He added community service to the mission of the dental school. He has a unique way with people. I've had him on 127th Street at 7:30 p.m, meeting with 14 women from a women's group from a little church.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Albert Thompson, a black graduate now in private practice in Manhattan, was one who answered Dr. Formicola's call in 1978 to help recruit minority students, faculty and administrators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all the attention paid to drawing minorities into the professions, fewer than 5  percent of American dentists are black. And yet minority graduates are more likely to go to work in minority neighborhoods, where inadequate dental care remains a problem, resulting in everything from children with excessive cavities to disparities between white and nonwhite survivors of oral cancers. There are still no pediatric dentists or oral surgeons in private practice in Harlem, Dr. Mitchell-Lewis said, even as research shows a link between oral health and heart disease, diabetes and premature babies. ''We are still at the beginning,'' he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question now is whether the successes achieved under Dr. Formicola will continue. ''He's created the template,'' Mr. Dunn said. ''Hopefully, Columbia will continue the legacy.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Mark Matcho)</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Maybe that's why, in this race of all-but-certain presidential nominees, I find myself distracted by Alan Keyes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or rather by the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes. I'm not suggesting that Keyes is likely to repeat in New Hampshire his startling showing in the Iowa caucuses--a third-place finish with 14 percent of the vote--much less that he'll still be battling George W. Bush for the Republican nomination as the party convention draws nearer. The subplot I've been following treats a much simpler question: Are white voters truly capable of looking beyond a black candidate's race?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans seem certain that the answer is ""no,"" while white voters--on much the same evidence--believe it has long since been answered in the affirmative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Didn't we help elect David Dinkins mayor of New York City and Doug Wilder governor of Virginia? whites will say. And blacks will reply: Yes, but in substantial measure out of racial guilt--which means that it was, at bottom, a race-tinged vote. Similarly with elected officials from Massachusetts's Ed Brooke to Oklahoma's J. C. Watts, and with that most-popular of noncandidates, Colin Powell. I remember remarking, with utter seriousness, that the white-led bandwagon for Powell was a way for white people to prove to themselves they had gotten over their fixation on race. Now Alan Keyes has me wondering if I've gotten over mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A televised interview with a handful of Iowans after the Keyes surprise makes my point. The reporter was talking to these white conservatives--members of what we call the ""religious right""--and a couple of them were explaining how they compared Keyes and Gary Bauer and found Keyes's views more to their liking. One of the respondents mentioned that she'd like to see Keyes on the ticket of the eventual nominee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What struck me about that brief exchange was that it seemed genuinely to have nothing to do with race, only issues. And I was reminded by something in my long-repressed memory:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Strom Thurmond, as Old South and conservative as they come, standing up at those 1991 Judiciary Committee hearings for Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. I don't imagine Thurmond was motivated by racial angst. Indeed, the Senate's 1,000-year-old man seemed indifferent to the fact that Thomas's white wife, Virginia, was a daily fixture at those hearings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He may have supported Thomas for reasons I would reject, but on this issue, at least, Strom Thurmond seemed, like that woman in Iowa, to have surmounted race in favor of political philosophy. I have to think it's a good thing--and too little recognized by those of us who insist we want to be judged by characteristics other than the color of our skins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But look how these conservatives get beyond race--by supporting African Americans whose views are anathema to the rank and file of black voters. Doesn't that demonstrate their disregard for what black people in general think? Doesn't it suggest that the only way they can forget our race is by supporting black folk who have forgotten it too?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what would we expect?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That these dyed-in-the-wool conservatives--who oppose a woman's right to choose abortion, who think <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is Satan's own tool and who never saw a new government initiative they didn't hate-- should get out the vote for Jesse Jackson Sr.?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't mean to suggest that all conservatives have retired their suspicions of racial minorities, or that racism and a certain brand of conservatism have been disentangled. I'm suggesting only that those of us who refuse to believe that white people can be conservative without being against black people may have some disentangling of our own to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And a modest bit of celebration. For if conservatives--the people we have always viewed as our dedicated enemies--are willing to move beyond our race to consider our character and our philosophy, why there may be hope for white liberals, too.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

It's an experiment providing a ""universal basic income,"" or UBI, to low-income Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In conjunction with the Marin Community Foundation, which plans to contribute $3 million to the effort, the Marin County Board of Supervisors has allocated $400,000 in public funds for the experiment. The program is similar to one recently completed in Stockton, Calif., but one major difference sets the Marin experiment apart: race and sex discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Stockton UBI experiment provided payments to 125 residents of neighborhoods at or below Stockton's median household income. The Marin regime will do the same, but beneficiaries must be ""mothers of color."" That term is undefined, but it's clear that fathers and white mothers are ineligible to participate. A similar race-based scheme has been announced in Oakland, Calif.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter what one thinks of UBI as a policy matter, the use of public funds in the Marin scheme is legally dubious. The California Constitution's equal-protection clause, like the federal one in the 14th Amendment, applies ""strict scrutiny""—the highest possible level of judicial scrutiny—to racial classifications. California courts, unlike federal ones, also apply strict scrutiny to sex classifications. In Connerly v. State Personnel Board (2001), a California appeals court made that clear in invalidating both race- and sex-based <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If I had grown up in Marin County under its proposed UBI regime, my family would have been ineligible to participate. I grew up poor and at times homeless or living in public housing projects. But my mother, who is white, was raising her three black children on her own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin Community Foundation's chief executive, Thomas Peters, has said that ""this first cohort will focus on low-income moms of color"" because they face ""the greatest aggregate of challenges: low income, young children and facing the daily travails and insults of overt and covert racial discrimination.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My mother was low-income, had three young children and faced racial discrimination. We lived in black communities where black men were stigmatized for consorting with white women, and that stigma flowed to those women and their biracial children.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If my mother was somehow privileged over similarly situated black mothers, it could only have been by the slimmest possible margin.

In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

But this gives them too much credit. It implies they have a starting team. Not these days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bench is where players are stashed who can step in for the first team--for a governor, a U.S. senator, a state attorney general. . . . The GOP currently has none of these top positions. Democrats occupy the governor's office, both U.S. Senate seats and five of seven statewide partisan offices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of two statewide elected Republicans--Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush--has suffered a potential career-ending scandal. Scratch him as a future governor. The other--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Secretary of State Bill Jones--angered major GOP campaign contributors by defecting to Sen. John McCain after having committed to Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Jones is now on the political disabled list.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is one healthy player, and he's not exactly a bench warmer. He's the new state Senate minority leader, Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte, 44, is the most politically savvy, articulate Republican in the Legislature. Indeed, it's tough to think of a Republican throughout California who commands more respect among politicians of either party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""He makes things happen in the Capitol,"" notes GOP consultant Ray McNally. ""And he does it without surrendering his conservative principles. Without selling out.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte's first political job was slapping on bumper strips for gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan as a 10-year-old. Eventually, he became an advance man for Vice President George Bush, worked for several politicians and was elected to the Assembly in 1990.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Quickly rising to Republican leader, Brulte orchestrated the GOP's ""takeover"" of the Assembly in 1994. But three Republicans sold out to Democrat Willie Brown and Brulte was denied the speakership. In 1996, he moved to the Senate, became GOP caucus chairman and, when Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine stepped down as minority leader for family health reasons last week, Brulte succeeded him without a fight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's now his responsibility to improve the GOP's 25-15 disadvantage in the Senate--or at least keep the scarce seats the party holds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What drives Brulte is political conquest and legislative compromise, not any ideological cause. He brings to the arena congeniality. ""I don't provoke people,"" notes the 6-foot, 4-inch, 260- pound GOP leader.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That means less legislative gridlock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's not one to hang up a budget over, say, abortion funding. In truth, no recent GOP leader has, partly due to Brulte's coaxing. He's basically antiabortion but tries to avoid the divisive issue. Same with gun control; he mostly votes against it, but cautions Republicans that they are on the wrong side of history on firearms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked how his party got to this low point, Brulte replies: ""It allowed itself to be painted as intolerant. It picked issues that tended to divide rather than to unite. And we're now [in the Senate] trying to focus on issues that unite.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Issues like school accountability, lower college fees, transportation planning. He won't get into the errant, divisive issues--abortion, illegal immigration, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte has his own <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program: He pumped $400,000 from his political kitty into the winning primary campaigns of Republican women and minorities. ""I wanted to send a signal that at the highest level of the party, we're prepared to put our money where our mouth is,"" he says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An optimist, Brulte professes not to worry about the GOP's future in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Conventional wisdom is historically wrong,"" he says. ""Three years ago, Gray Davis was pretty much derided. Today he's governor. . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Perception always trails reality. And the Republican Party was in trouble long before people recognized it. We're still in trouble, but we're better off than people think.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The party is financially better off since Brulte became its finance chairman last fall. It was $300,000 in debt; now it has more than $1 million in the bank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Considered Bush's point man in California, Brulte recruited the candidate for a $2-million-plus party fund-raising dinner. This week, Bush is in California again raising another $2 million for the state and national parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Says Gov. Davis' chief strategist, Garry South: ""I think the world of Brulte. We're honest with each other. He's never sleazed me. I pick his brain. He picks mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""My only concern about Brulte is he's had such a meteoric rise, he's going to think the next step is running for governor.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not likely. But given their bench, Republicans could do worse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Message No: ..ACCN: 00042160</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: GRAPHIC-DRAWING: SACRAMENTO</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
650b1963cf394af06984d0b9	aa_opeds_sample/txt/431493919.xml.txt	"<div><p>A Lesson In Bigotry And Liberty</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THIS town, which served as a headquarters of the Revolutionary Army, usually celebrates the Fourth of July with a dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence, complete with muskets and tricorn hats. But this year, Morristown also had a live-action drama showcasing those unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The action began when a white supremacist from Mississippi won the right in court to hold a rally here yesterday. Richard Barrett, whose Nationalist Movement oath declares ''the white race is the superlative civilizer,'' said he chose Morristown because of its history. Just as George Washington ''said no to the privileges of the king, today we're saying no to the privileges of minorities,'' he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett got what he wanted yesterday -- helmeted police protecting his right to march on Washington Street, a crowd of angry counter-protesters that drew pepper spray and 10 arrests. A perfect forum for a man with bullhorn and bombast. Mr. Barrett brought to town an anemic anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> protest and a racist version of the Declaration of Independence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But on Monday night, as Mr. Barrett prepared to deliver his divisive message, Morristown made its elegant statement. About 1,000 people filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't have done it without him. ''We are here tonight to reject any notion that one race is superior to another,'' Calvary's pastor, the Rev. Jerry Carter, said to cheers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The service and a candlelight march to the Morristown Green were arranged at the urging of the mayor, John J. DeLaney Jr., who was looking for a way to counter Mr. Barrett without giving him the satisfaction of a confrontation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The town has about 17,000 residents --  about 15 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic -- and just around the corner from Calvary church is evidence that all is not harmonious. Outside a house, a sign commemorates the death of a black resident who was killed last year by the police in a neighboring town. Prosecutors cleared the officers, but, for some, his death remains an example of racial profiling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MONDAY night, though, was a display of racial accord. Rabbi David Nesson of Morristown's Jewish Community Center reminded the crowd that Washington once wrote to a synagogue in Newport, R.I., that one of the country's guiding ideals was ''to give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jakki Dumas-Footman, 33, a financial analyst, said she felt compelled to come to the service with her daughter even though she grew up black in a largely white Morristown neighborhood and rarely felt racism. ''I've never seen a K.K.K. march,'' she said. ''I brought my daughter. She knows about the K.K.K. I want her to see it. This is our history, in a way.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nate Moore, a 58-year-old computer consultant, came Monday night remembering that history from having grown up black in Alabama. Mr. Barrett's message ''really astounded me,'' he said. ''I really thought these days were passed.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The songs of equality at the church recalled the old days, Mr. Moore said, but there were more white faces in the pews,  and the ranks of racists were thinner. ''I think you have to accept the differences and move on,'' he said. ''I think that's what we're doing more of -- accepting the differences and moving on.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But moving on is not a straight course.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monday night's harmony gave way to yesterday's ugliness. Mr. Barrett's sad parade of eight followers was separated from an angry crowd of about 250 by barricades and helmeted police on horses. At the height of the event, protesters from groups including the Progressive Labor Party were hurling vile taunts at the police as some protesters knocked down barricades and threw golf balls and batteries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asa Watkins, an 83-year-old artist from Morristown, had come to oppose Mr. Barrett, but was taken aback by the anger on both sides.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Watkins was reminded that Washington had spent two treacherous winters in Morristown on the way to victory. This Fourth of July freedom had another tough, but victorious, round in Morristown. ''It's a messy process, democracy is,'' said Mr. Watkins, leaving the rally. ''It always is.''</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
650b1963cf394af06984d0b9	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1987023512.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Heartbeat of Racism Is Denial</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When our reality is too ugly, we deny reality. It is too painful to look at. Reality is too hard to accept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mental health experts routinely say that denial is among the most common defense mechanisms. Denial is how the person defends his superior sense of self, her racially unequal society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Denial is how America defends itself as superior to “shithole countries” in Africa and elsewhere, as President Trump reportedly described them in a White House meeting last week, although he has since, well, denied that. It’s also how America defends itself as superior to those “developing countries” in Africa, to quote how liberal opponents of Mr. Trump might often describe them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump appears to be unifying America — unifying Americans in their denial. The more racist Mr. Trump sounds, the more Trump country denies his racism, and the more his opponents look away from their own racism to brand Trump country as racist. Through it all, America remains a unified country of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reckoning of Mr. Trump’s racism must become the reckoning of American racism. Because the American creed of denial — “I’m not a racist” — knows no political parties, no ideologies, no colors, no regions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, affirmed that Mr. Trump did use the term “shithole” during a White House meeting on immigration with lawmakers. Mr. Durbin rightfully described Mr. Trump’s words as “hate-filled, vile and racist,” and added, “I cannot believe that in the history of the White House in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Trump is no exception. In framing Mr. Trump’s racism as exceptional, in seeking to highlight the depth of the president’s cruelty, Mr. Durbin, a reliably liberal senator, showed the depth of denial of American racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Begin with the eight presidents who held slaves while in the Oval Office. Then consider how Abraham Lincoln urged black people to leave the United States. “Even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race,” Lincoln told five black guests at the White House in 1862. So “it is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raging then as we are raging now, the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison responded, “Can anything be more puerile, absurd, illogical, impertinent, untimely?” He added that “had it not been for the cupidity of their white enslavers, not one of their race would now be found upon this continent.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Presidential history also includes the social Darwinism of Theodore Roosevelt, the federal-government-segregating, “Birth of a Nation”-praising Woodrow Wilson — and the bigotry that came from the mouths of presidents who are generally seen as essential to racial progress. President Lyndon B. Johnson said “nigger” nearly as often as Ku Klux Klansmen did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism. Where there is suffering from racist policies, there are denials that those policies are racist. The beat of denial sounds the same across time and space.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up to the beat of racist denial in Queens, not far from where Mr. Trump grew up. I was raised in the urban “hell” of neighborhoods he probably avoided, alongside immigrants from countries he derided last week. In school or elsewhere, we all heard recitals of the American ideal of equality, especially on the day we celebrate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Those events often feature recitals of the words “all men are created equal,” which were written by a slaveholder who once declared that black people “are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thomas Jefferson was not a founding father of equality. He was a founding father of the heartbeat of denial that lives through both Mr. Trump’s denials and the assertion that his racial views are abnormal for America and its presidents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fifty years ago, Richard Nixon transformed this historic heartbeat of denial into an intoxicating political philosophy. His presidential candidacy appealed to George Wallace-type segregationists while also attracting Americans who refused to live near “dangerous” black residents, obstructed the desegregation of schools, resisted <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies, framed black mothers on welfare as undeserving, called the black family pathological and denigrated black culture — all those racists who refused to believe they were racist in 1968.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nixon designed his campaign, one of his advisers explained, to allow a potential supporter to “avoid admitting to himself that he was attracted by” the “racist appeal.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new vocabulary emerged, allowing users to evade admissions of racism. It still holds fast after all these years. The vocabulary list includes these: law and order. War on drugs. Model minority. Reverse discrimination. Race-neutral. Welfare queen. Handout. Tough on crime. Personal responsibility. Black-on-black crime. Achievement gap. No excuses. Race card. Colorblind. Post-racial. Illegal immigrant. Obamacare. War on Cops. Blue Lives Matter. All Lives Matter. Entitlements. Voter fraud. Economic anxiety.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The denials using these phrases come from both conservatives and white liberals who think people of color are stuck in cycles of unstable families and criminal cultures, and that the deprivations of poverty and discrimination spin out bad people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump opened his candidacy with racism, calling Mexicans criminals and rapists. Since taking office, he has looked away from the disaster zone in Puerto Rico, he has called some violent white supremacists “very fine people,” and he has described Nigerians as living in “huts .”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When someone identifies the obvious, Mr. Trump resounds the beat of denial as he did before he was president: “I’m the least racist person that you’ve ever met ,” that “you’ve ever seen ,” that “you’ve ever encountered .”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are ugly denials. But it’s the denials from those who stand in strong opposition to this president that are more frustrating to me: denials that their attacks on identity politics are racist. Denials that the paltry number of people of color in elite spaces marks racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those denials echo the same ones that frustrated Dr. King in 1963 as he sat in a Birmingham jail cell and wrote , “Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, I suspect, will go to his grave with his heart beating in denial of the ill will of racism. Many others will as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because we naturally want to look away from our ugliness. We paint over racist reality to make a beautiful delusion of self, of society. We defend this beautiful self and society from our racist reality with the weapons of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Denial is fueled by the stigma associated with being a racist. Feeding the stigma is how “racist” is considered almost like an identity, a brand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a racist is not who a person is. A racist is what a person is, what a person is saying, what a person is doing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Racist is not a fixed category like “not racist,” which is steeped denial. Only racists say they are not racist. Only the racist lives by the heartbeat of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The antiracist lives by the opposite heartbeat, one that rarely and irregularly sounds in America — the heartbeat of confession.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/opinion/sunday/heartbeat-of-racism-denial.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: IBRAM X.

650b1963cf394af06984d0b9	aa_opeds_sample/txt/408321836.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Power Ignored by the Press</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thirty years ago there was a flurry of interest by the press in the activities of America's nonprofit, tax-exempt foundations. Some, we discovered, acted as conduits for CIA subsidies to civic and educational organizations and subsidized the publication of various books and magazines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was all part of the Cold War against the Soviet Union, although many recipients of the agency's cash didn't know that and didn't know their patron. Not much came from these disclosures. The parties promised to sin no more and before long, the affair had faded into the misty regions of memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media turned to other pursuits and today, as Nicholas Lemann writes in the Atlantic Monthly, ""The press, which pays close attention to politics and government through deeply ingrained reflex, largely ignores foundations, or treats them, in a polite but faintly bored tone, as innocuous do-gooders rather than significant actors.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our interest in these institutions flickered briefly a couple of years ago when conservative elements in Congress started asking questions and proposing legislation to curb the political activities of foundations and the thousands of tax-exempt special interest groups that have spread like kudzu during the past 25 years. They now occupy a respectable share of the available office space in Washington. The ""public interests"" they represent range from the World Association of Alcohol Beverage Industries and the Dairy Recognition Foundation to the League of Women Voters and the YMCA.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax exemption, as Lemann reminds us, is granted to foundations and their ""public interest"" cousins on condition that they forswear any ""attempt to influence political or legislative outcomes, except by providing technical information. This rule is violated widely. In fact, it's difficult to think of a significant policy initiative taken by the federal government or voiced in a recent presidential campaign that didn't have some foundation undergirding.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is complicated by the federal government, which provides funding to many politically active nonprofits -- the National Council of Senior Citizens, for example -- that administer various federal educational and job-training programs. Republican critics in Congress claim that through bookkeeping devices these federal grants can be misused to finance political activities. They lost the fight last year, and the subject has more or less vanished from media agendas. That is unfortunate because foundations and the ""public interest"" nonprofits are a big, influential and expanding industry. Lemann reports that during the past 15 years or so the number of foundations has nearly doubled, from 22,000 to 39,000. Their assets now exceed $200 billion, half of it controlled by fewer than 200 foundations, according to another student of the industry, Alan Reynolds of the Hudson Institute.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This wealth, he writes, represents ""enormous influence over which public policy, social program or artistic endeavor will succeed or fail."" Lemann makes a similar point. Big foundations, ""which have a distinctly liberal cast use their tax-exempt dollars to fund everything from the civil rights movement to studies supporting the expansion of the welfare state to disarmament and population control abroad."" As conservative foundations have prospered since 1980 they ""have been particularly successful in training cadres of activists and policymakers to serve their cause, by subsidizing books that change the tenor of public discourse (for example, Dinesh D'Souza's `Illiberal Education') and supplying the government with policy ideas (the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for the early Reagan Administration . . . ).""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reach of the foundations is felt in ostensibly private affairs as well. Peter Skerry, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, recalls in the Wilson Quarterly the 1994 upheaval within the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The incumbent executive director, Benjamin Chavis, was ousted. ""But it was seldom noted {in the press},"" Skerry observes, ""that his removal was instigated not by the membership but by the Ford Foundation, which withheld a major grant until the NAACP's finances were put in order. One of the few observers who did note it was Washington Post columnist William Raspberry {who asked} . . . how such a venerable organization, still 600,000 members strong, has come to the point . . . of being beholden to a private foundation for its survival?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foundations may even work through relatively hollow organizational fronts. Skerry cites the case of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) ""which seeks to represent not only all Mexican Americans but all of the nation's 27 million Latinos. This claim is widely accepted, and the organization has played a prominent role in recent debates over immigration and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Yet it has no members and gets most of its funding from corporations and foundations, especially the Ford Foundation, which played the critical role in establishing it in the late 1960s. Lacking members, MALDEF has no real bonds of accountability to the communities it strives to represent.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Kettering Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia foundation, are less well-known than the Ford or Rockefeller foundations. But they have had a significant impact on a number of nongovernmental institutions, including the American press. Their intellectual leadership and money have been largely responsible for the ""civic journalism"" movement that has been taken up by the media in more than 40 cities. The guiding principle of ""civic journalism"" is that the public, through polls and ""focus groups"" usually financed by the foundations, should play an important role in setting the news and editorial agendas of the press. Newspapers and broadcasters that have embraced the movement are generally pleased with the results.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many critics such as William Woo, former editor of the St. Louis Post Dispatch, believe the press risks its independence and credibility by aligning itself and becoming financially beholden to foundations with ""a very ideological view of America, a very definite view of the road America should take."" He puts Pew in that category.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Lemann, the broader problem is that foundations ""have no voters, no customers, no investors."" So they operate in an unexamined environment, ignored by the press and public alike. No one asks the ""main policy questions about them -- How, exactly, should their economic and political activities be restricted in return for their tax-exempt status? Does the tax exemption still make sense ?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This {isolation} ought to change. Foundations are becoming so much more significant so rapidly that they deserve to be brought into the company of central institutions whose course is the subject of constant public scrutiny and debate.""</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

A coalition of civil rights groups made the settlement possible by agreeing to pay 70 percent of the $433,500 judgment that Sharon Taxman won in a lower court for back pay and lawyers' fees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> thought that the Supreme Court, which was scheduled to hear the case in January, was likely to find the race-based layoff decision improper. They also feared the Court would have gone further and prohibited consideration of racial criteria in employment in general, thus jeopardizing voluntary <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> plans in all workplaces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Avoiding a Supreme Court ruling, in this situation, was a smart move. The Piscataway case was a difficult one with unusual facts. The teachers, hired the same day, had equal seniority and comparable qualifications. The school district, forced to trim staff for budget reasons, chose to keep the black teacher because she was the only black teacher in her department. The district's goal of maintaining racial diversity was honorable, but its approach was clumsy. The Clinton Administration, which first supported the action, reversed itself this summer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At some point, the Supreme Court will address whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits considering race in any employment decision, except as a remedy for actual discrimination.

Or perhaps I've slipped into another dimension where perceptions are altered, where lies are truth, where yes means no, or the meaning of ""is"" is debatable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last Wednesday was one of those days. I was reading a New York Times columnist's accounting of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' speech at the American Enterprise Institute's dinner honoring him, and I wondered whether someone had spiked my water with some reality-altering chemical at my table.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the reliably witty Maureen Dowd described Thomas' speech as ""bellicose,"" ""self-pitying"" and ""self-aggrandizing,"" I described the same speech to friends as inspiring. Maybe it was the stirring rendition of ""America the Beautiful"" (I'm a shameless sucker for patriotic songs.), but I seem to have heard a different speech altogether.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is true, as Dowd pointed out, that the 1,600-person crowd was mostly white; that red meat was served and, presumably, eaten; that Thomas talked and talked and talked. But it is also true that no one stirred or so much as cleared his throat during the hour-long speech. And true, too, that Thomas' standing ovation at the end was longer than is required by politeness and more spontaneous than one might naturally expect of a crowd merely tired of sitting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From which I must infer that others in the throng heard the message of ""duty, honor, country"" as I did--as values worthy of the trenches and of our occasional discomfort. Nothing he said evoked ""comparisons to Bill Clinton's defense for pardoning Marc Rich when he said it was easy to say no and took courage to say yes,"" as Dowd wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It doesn't take courage to pardon an unscrupulous criminal in exchange for political favors and possibly huge sums of money, though corruption helps. It does take courage, on the other hand, to fight for your principles, to stand by your convictions, to tell the truth in your heart, as Thomas recommended throughout his speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's what Thomas really talked about, even as he acknowledged some personal understanding of these matters. He mentioned having experienced the firing line, from his Supreme Court confirmation hearings through media portrayals that were painful. He spoke, too, of his experiences as a black man who dares to question such ""black"" issues as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, school busing and welfare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Those who come to engage in debates of consequence, and who challenge accepted wisdom, should expect to be treated badly,"" he said. On issues of race, ""there was no real debate or honest discussion. When whites questioned the conventional wisdom on these issues, it was considered bad form; when blacks did so, it was treason.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Honest people know these words to be true, yet some would revile Thomas for saying them. Knowing that in advance--understanding that contradictory words will be greeted with personal attack and saying them anyway--requires the sort of courage Thomas was trying to advance that night and which surely he had to muster in order to make that speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As he made clear without bellicosity, it takes courage to participate in active citizenship. It takes courage to face down jeering crowds because you invite debate. It takes courage not to be cowed into the silence of self-censorship when brutes resort to in- your-face intimidation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one knows this better than Thomas, a black man who managed to navigate two American cultures, both black and white, in his odyssey from Pin Point, Ga., to the U.S. Supreme Court. That sort of journey takes courage. And though Thomas never said so, it also takes guts, which this man has to spare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kathleen Parker is a syndicated columnist based in South Carolina.

Patrick Fitzgerald's Thursday news conference about the Duff financial empire. It was time for lunch; I was hungry and wanted to think this through. There was only one place to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""You've just got to go to Gene's,"" said a friend and colleague. She meant my favorite steakhouse, and the Duffs' favorite steakhouse, Gene & Georgetti's.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gene's is a hangout where information is traded, among politicians, insiders, reporters, wise-guys, salesmen, consultants, from the buttoned down to the gold chains crowd. And what makes it work is that they serve the best steak in the city, period. The service is impeccable without being showy and the drinks are honest. Gene's is a part of the old Chicago, the city as it was before so much of the downtown was turned into a theme park.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also the place where the Duffs came up to me about a year ago, their tough, hard eyes smiling. They asked me why they don't ever see my children playing in the front yard of my home in the suburbs. They asked it twice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the columns didn't stop and neither did the news stories by the investigative reporters, or Tribune editorials about the mayor's friends. And here's why:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not about getting personal with the mayor or the Duffs. Though the mayor has been a frequent target in my column, what drives the criticism is the obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars that go to his pals. In deal after deal after deal, the attitude is that his guys can take what they want and the people in the neighborhoods better shut up about it, while higher taxes put more and more pressure on families to pay for the deals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not personal, it's business, and it's your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley is an able politician and has done some good things, including taking personal responsibility for trying to improve the public schools. But he must also take personal responsibility for his friends who get rich on government contracts he controls, paid for by our tax dollars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Duff stories broke in 1999, when Tribune investigative reporters Ray Gibson, Andrew Martin and Laurie Cohen wrote about the Duffs' City Hall deals and their connections to Daley and the Outfit. You can find the archive of the stories available on the Tribune's Web site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of what was alleged in the indictments was laid out in those stories: that the Duffs, who are white, ran phony front companies that got $100 million in city contracts that should have gone to firms owned by women or minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley knew the Duffs were not minorities, even when he was a crime-fighting Cook County state's attorney. A Duff sits across from you, gives you campaign cash, pours a drink, it's reasonable to assume that even the mayor could tell whether the person was white or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Think back to how the media treated the late Mayor Harold Washington, when Washington's buddies were involved in contract scandals. Back then, even minor stories about corruption got sustained media attention, particularly from TV and radio, even if the dollar amounts were only chump change. Washington faced constant media pressure on corruption issues. TV crawled all over him for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If I was white, you wouldn't be doing this to me,"" Washington said once, in a private moment, as he filched a smoke from me and we stood in a parking lot after a campaign stop. We argued about it, and I told him that since we were off the record, he didn't have to play the race card. ""You don't know anything, do you?"" he said. He was right. I was a kid, then. I didn't know.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the Duff stories first broke, involving a white mayor and white guys getting rich, the Chicago media scrutiny wasn't as intense. TV news didn't hound Daley the way it hounded Washington. The mayor must appreciate the kindness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm sure he also appreciates the new federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald. The feds have already outflanked former Gov. George Ryan's Republicans. Ryan himself is a target. And now the feds are moving toward Daley's Democratic City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Daley-Duff relationship is not just a Tribune story anymore. A group of citizens--sworn as federal grand jurors--looked at the evidence. They didn't find a flaw in the system, as the city claims. They found a crime.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A couple friends and I talked of this at Gene's, about the change in things, about the importance of an independent federal prosecutor, about how the bipartisan political clique that runs this state tried to stop Fitzgerald's appointment in hopes of installing one of their own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just then, the cell phones began chirping and word of the Duff indictments began to spread through the bar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had our steaks medium rare.

Neglectful landlords. Battles over minority enrollment. In the imagination of many liberal New Yorkers, private universities like New York and Columbia are often at odds with struggling communities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's Dr. Allan J. Formicola to contradict the usual image. Retiring this month after 23 years as dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, Dr. Formicola, 61, used his position to attract minorities to the dental school and to bring high-quality dental care to Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Formicola, a man with two wings of curly salt-and-pepper hair and a warm  manner, achieved this partly through a personality that makes him as comfortable in a boardroom as on a street corner. He reached out to minority alumni, some of whom had felt isolated at the dental school. At a time of falling enrollment at dental schools nationally, he sold Columbia on encouraging new black and brown faces and more local involvement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The grandson of Italian immigrants, Dr. Formicola was only 38 when he arrived at Columbia in 1978. But his resume included a stint in the late 60's teaching at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a city infamous for its treatment of black people. He describes himself as someone who was always enamored of the ideals of the Great Society and the civil rights movement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''He's got a tremendous amount of respect from the people in Harlem,'' said Paul Dunn, vice president of Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement. ''He's a man who's had a lot of vision and a lot of commitment to bringing people together and building bridges.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia and Harlem, in particular, have had a fractious relationship. Most famously, the 1968 student protest was sparked by Columbia's plan to build a gym in Morningside Park. Recently, Columbia's Morningside Heights neighbors took the university to court over plans to build faculty housing and an elementary school on West 110th Street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dental school, founded in 1852 and incorporated into Columbia in 1917, had its own history, mostly of indifference. Only 13 blacks graduated from the the school between 1923 and 1980. Dr. Formicola helped enhance minority enrollment to the point that out of a student body of about 300, each class has 6 to 10 blacks and 6 to 8 Latinos. Also under his guidance, Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood now have three community health centers, dental clinics in seven neighborhood schools, and a van offering dental care to children and the aged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Formicola's achievements are an implicit answer to a question behind the never-ending debate about <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and other issues involving inequality: what do those in power owe those on the other end?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''It's hard to say when you're sitting in the midst of a community in need that our mission should be research and education,'' Dr. Formicola said as he sat in his immaculate office in Washington Heights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia's dental school now leads the nation in projects like community partnerships for clinics, said Dennis Mitchell-Lewis, an assistant professor at the school and the director of many of the outreach efforts. ''Dean Formicola has changed everything,'' Dr. Mitchell-Lewis said. ''He added community service to the mission of the dental school. He has a unique way with people. I've had him on 127th Street at 7:30 p.m, meeting with 14 women from a women's group from a little church.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Albert Thompson, a black graduate now in private practice in Manhattan, was one who answered Dr. Formicola's call in 1978 to help recruit minority students, faculty and administrators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all the attention paid to drawing minorities into the professions, fewer than 5  percent of American dentists are black. And yet minority graduates are more likely to go to work in minority neighborhoods, where inadequate dental care remains a problem, resulting in everything from children with excessive cavities to disparities between white and nonwhite survivors of oral cancers. There are still no pediatric dentists or oral surgeons in private practice in Harlem, Dr. Mitchell-Lewis said, even as research shows a link between oral health and heart disease, diabetes and premature babies. ''We are still at the beginning,'' he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question now is whether the successes achieved under Dr. Formicola will continue. ''He's created the template,'' Mr. Dunn said. ''Hopefully, Columbia will continue the legacy.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Mark Matcho)</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build.

Gov. Joe Rogers are trotted out like trophies, an attractive serving of political correctness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up in a black Republican family. My father was a delegate from Kansas to the 1964 GOP convention. On our way to the convention in San Francisco, we were run off the road in Arizona by a car with John Birch Society bumper stickers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was only 14, but I couldn't understand my father's party loyalty. Yet when I watched him walk to the podium at the Cow Palace and give then-Pennsylvania Gov. William Scranton's seconding speech, I experienced the contradiction. I felt proud even though I knew that the Republicans had soundly defeated a proposal to strengthen the civil rights plank with pledges for speedy school desegregation, full voting rights and elimination of job bias.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Was my father flawed?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the years, I have observed that most African Americans in the Republican Party care less about identity politics than their counterparts in the Democratic Party. My father's mantra was the business of self-reliance, doing for yourself rather than waiting for the government. And his lectures to me were on how blacks must be active in both political parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in 2000, the reasons some blacks join the Republican Party are more complicated. Thirty years ago, my father, along with other civil rights activists such as then-Assistant Secretary of Labor Art Fletcher, were building a legacy. They demonstrated a commitment to the black community. Fletcher's Philadelphia Plan under Richard Nixon's presidency increased the opportunities for minorities and women to compete in the job market. The Philadelphia Plan made federal contractors meet specific goals in hiring women and minorities, the forerunner of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now, many black Republicans just enjoy unsettling people. Sound bites and big hats. Others like Rogers state that they have chosen to take the ""road less traveled."" And as I listened to him in a debate with Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) at the recent National Assn. of Black Journalists convention, I recognized the advantages of not going where the competition is fierce. For the truly politically ambitious, there appears to be an impressive list of Democratic wannabes. Why queue up behind a long line of well- established power brokers?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At that same time, however, I saw someone who was brave enough to stand up to a polite but solid wall of contempt from the black audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was never that brave. Although I was a black Republican until my father died in 1983, I only took advantage of his sweat equity. I inserted myself into the 1976 GOP convention in Kansas City and worked in the press office handling media relations for the black delegates and party leaders. In the early 1980s, because of my father and good political contacts, I was offered a public affairs position in Washington, D.C.. I was seduced by the image of power, politics and press initially, but after two weeks of trying out D.C. with interviews, meetings and receptions, I declined the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was changing and developing different political values. I observed that the era of black Republicans like my father had passed. And what I saw in its place was no longer for me. I left the party to become a Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those early days, I had considered myself a pragmatist by being Republican. Although my friends labeled me an opportunist, I rationalized that everything was a boost for my career. My commitment, however, was only to my father. Never did I reflect his loyalty to the Republican Party. Neither do the black Republicans I see today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My father had a faith in his party and its potential. He wanted to make a contribution for black people, to stand up and be counted even when it was dangerous. It was his personal honesty. It was his fine flaw.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sharon Woodson-Bryant is a Burbank freelance writer</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

There are 36 possible pairs of justices, and in the term just concluded something interesting happened.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The top three spots were all taken by pairs of women. However you matched them up, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan voted together at least 93 percent of the time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The alignments are a product of ideology, not biology. ""They are the three most liberal justices on the court, and it makes sense that they would often be in agreement,"" said Pamela Harris, an adviser to the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown's law school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The voting pattern highlighted the rightward drift of the fourth member of the court's liberal wing, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who broke from his usual allies in a series of important privacy cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, it was often the conservative justices who voted together the most: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., say, or Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. This year, the right was more fractured. (The statistics come from Scotusblog, and the trends hold whether you look at all cases or just divided ones.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three female justices also dominated Supreme Court arguments in the last term. Justice Ginsburg asked the first question 37 percent of the time. Justice Sotomayor asked the most questions, averaging more than 21 in each hourlong argument.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Kagan, a former dean of Harvard Law School and a former United States solicitor general, by many accounts asked the best questions of any of the justices. They were crisp and conversational and probed the heart of the case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The spotlight often captured Justice Sotomayor this term, as her best-selling memoir gave rise to a book tour that drew adoring crowds. She was profiled on ""60 Minutes,"" talked with Oprah Winfrey and Jon Stewart, and visited ""Sesame Street"" and ""The View.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lawyers who appear before her say she is a source of inspiration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I think she has come into her own and is establishing herself as a formidable and independent presence,"" said Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter in Washington who has argued 33 cases before the court and served as a law clerk to Justice Ginsburg. ""Like the other two women, she's very comfortable up there, and that's a great thing for a woman like me to see.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked by e-mail for an assessment of Justice Sotomayor, a normally sober political scientist did not stint on her exclamation points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""People love her!"" wrote Lee Epstein, who teaches at the University of Southern California. ""She made a lot of money!""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Sotomayor's financial disclosure forms show that she has received more than $3 million for the book.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Ginsburg's form for last year also contained an interesting disclosure. In November, she accepted an ""award recipient gift bag"" worth $2,500 -- a swag bag, in the lingo -- when she received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their day jobs, the votes of the three justices are neither wholly predictable nor wholly united, said Lisa T. McElroy, a law professor at Drexel University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It's important to note that the agreement was not on 'women's' or 'social justice' issues,"" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The female justices were divided in two of the term's biggest cases, Professor McElroy added. Justice Sotomayor wanted to provide an answer to whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, while the other two women said the court was powerless to decide the question in the context of a challenge to California's ban on the practice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor also split on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, with Justice Ginsburg filing the lone dissent in a case that sent a challenge to the University of Texas's <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> plan back to the lower courts for a second look under a more demanding standard. (Justice Kagan, who worked on the case as solicitor general, recused herself.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at University of California, Irvine, ""they are the three most liberal justices on the court, and so it is not surprising given their ideological similarity that they vote together the most.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Breyer, the next most liberal justice, voted with conservative justices in a decision allowing the police to take DNA samples from arrestees and in dissents from rulings limiting the use of police dogs to sniff for drugs outside homes and warrantless blood testing of people stopped for drunken driving.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all three cases, he and Justice Scalia traded places, with Justice Scalia joining the three women in pressing for broad Fourth Amendment protections.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I ought to be the pinup of the criminal defense bar,"" Justice Scalia told an audience at the University of Wyoming in October. He had been hunting in Wyoming, with Justice Kagan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia described their trip in an interview in February with Nina Totenberg at George Washington University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It was, unfortunately, not successful,"" he said. ""We got antelope tags, which are expensive for out of state, and mule deer tags. Didn't get a single shot at an antelope or a mule deer. So she ended up killing a white-tailed doe, which she could have done in my driveway.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""She dropped that doe with one shot,"" he said of Justice Kagan's exercise of her Second Amendment rights. ""Boom. Just like that.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia is also close to Justice Ginsburg, but there are limits to their friendship. ""I can't imagine Ruth hunting,"" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From Left, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan.

5d89c4dd68f9d60001a21500	aa_opeds_sample/txt/398881739.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Incredible Shrinking Kennedy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It could have been a far different election season this fall for Maryland's gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two summers ago, had Al Gore and his advisers stretched their imaginations beyond the hyperbolic ""ground-breaking"" choice of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as running mate, and tapped Mrs. Townsend instead, it's quite possible she'd be vice president today, stumping for Democratic candidates along with President Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lieberman's peak as a candidate in 2000 occurred on the very day he was chosen by Mr. Gore, with the expected mainstream media exultation at the ""daring"" selection of a Jewish man given the nod. Not only was the Connecticut senator overmatched by Dick Cheney in their one debate, but his hollow threats of censoring the entertainment industry, while accepting massive donations from Hollywood moguls, exposed him as a hypocrite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend was excluded from Mr. Gore's ""short list"" because of her inexperience -- one-and-a-half terms as Maryland's lieutenant governor and a failed congressional race in 1986 -- and presumably because her state is one of the most reliably Democratic in the nation. However, there's little doubt that her candidacy would not have cost Mr. Gore a single state he eventually won against President Bush. In fact, given her pedigree as Robert F. Kennedy's eldest child, with an extended family campaigning for the ticket, it's likely the team would've won New Hampshire, West Virginia and Florida, and thus the election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Mrs. Townsend, never a nimble candidate on her own, is struggling to fend off Republican Rep. Robert Ehrlich in this year's battle to succeed the unpopular Parris Glendening as Maryland's governor. The contest has been mired in a statistical dead heat since mid-summer -- a Mason-Dixon Maryland poll last weekend showed Mrs. Townsend leading Mr. Ehrlich by a 46% to 45% margin -- as Mrs. Townsend has failed to lock up the state's large black electorate, a base of voters that's typically a given for a Democratic candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend's political pitch has been less than perfect. In June she angered Baltimore City's black leaders by choosing retired Navy Admiral Charles Larson, a white former Republican, as her running mate. Mr. Ehrlich, meanwhile, a four-term congressman from Baltimore County, chose a black man, Michael Steele.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fairness, the current political environment, influenced as it's been by corporate scandals and a backlash against wealthy businessmen, doesn't make the most hospitable turf for a candidate born to privilege. In contrast to Mrs. Townsend, Mr. Ehrlich was reared in the blue-collar Baltimore suburb of Arbutus, where he earned an academic/sports scholarship to Princeton. He then returned to Maryland, spending eight years in the state's House of Delegates before being elected to Congress in 1994.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The juxtapositions of the two candidates have been occasionally startling, and more than occasionally provided good campaign rhetoric for Mr. Ehrlich. Last July, when Mrs. Townsend had a fund-raiser for glittering contributors at her family's mythic Hyannis Port compound, Mr. Ehrlich held a $20 per person crab-and-beer fest in Anne Arundel County. He remarked at the time, ""We're having fun, obviously. The lieutenant governor is home, and I am home.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the polls tightened during the summer, Mrs. Townsend shed her pledge to wage a ""positive"" campaign and hired longtime Kennedy confidante Robert Shrum, the populist millionaire known for slash-and-burn advertising and rhetoric. Four years ago, Mr. Shrum orchestrated an attack against Gov. Glendening's GOP opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, that called her a racist, a charge that even Democrat and then-Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke repudiated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter Beinart, editor of the New Republic, wrote in the magazine's Oct. 21 issue that ""Election 2002 does have at least one ennobling characteristic: Race has never mattered less."" But in Maryland that's not true. In a late-September debate held at the predominantly black Morgan State University and sponsored by the allegedly nonpartisan NAACP, Mrs. Townsend attacked her competitor's opposition to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Mr. Ehrlich ""opposes <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> based on race,"" she said, ""Well, let me tell you something, slavery was based on race. Lynching was based on race. Discrimination is based on race. Jim Crow was based on race. And <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> should be based on race.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One can question Mr. Ehrlich's consent to debate Mrs. Townsend in such a setting -- his family was booed upon entering the auditorium -- but it's not clear that such demagoguery will work. A Democratic consultant in Maryland told me that ""KKT won the debate in the hall, but Ehrlich won it on TV because the performance of the NAACP and the mob in the auditorium turned off many white voters.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither is it clear that Mrs. Townsend's caricature of Mr. Ehrlich as a Gingrich-style extremist resonates with voters. While he has voted with the Republican majority in the House 90% of the time, his moderate views on social issues -- qualified support for abortion rights, legalization of marijuana for terminal patients and pro-stem cell research -- hardly squares with her charge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The result of this race might be determined by the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan region, including Maryland's Democratic Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. Mrs. Townsend has aired television advertisements in the past week slamming Mr. Ehrlich for his record on gun control, while on the stump emphasizing her own family's well-known tragedies at the hands of lunatic assassins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether this politicization of a hot-button issue invigorates her base supporters or turns off independents who believe she's exploiting the killings could decide the election. Even Maureen Dowd, the liberal New York Times op-ed columnist criticized Mrs. Townsend, writing on Oct. 16: ""Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is trying to capitalize on her personal history with tragic gun killings to save her limp gubernatorial bid.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An even bigger question is whether citizens in Maryland -- especially in areas where the sniper has killed -- will be motivated to vote on Election Day if the assailant isn't apprehended by then. A low turnout is bad news for Mrs. Townsend, and should Mr. Ehrlich prevail, will terminate her future political career.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Smith, a Baltimore resident for 14 years, is editor-in-chief of the New York Press, for which he writes the ""Mugger"" column.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
5d89c4dd68f9d60001a21500	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1761271674.xml.txt	"<div><p>Ease the poverty penalty in college admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harold O. Levy is executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I was chancellor of the New York City schools, I thought that if you were smart and poor, you could write your own ticket to college. I was dead wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, where I serve as executive director, reveals that only 3 percent of students at our most selective colleges come from the 25 percent of families with the lowest incomes, while 72 percent come from the richest 25 percent of families.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The unfairness of the situation is compounded by the fact that once admitted, poor students soar academically. According to our study, the poor students who do attend these elite schools graduate at equal rates and earn similarly high grades as their wealthy peers. The Cooke Foundation awards scholarships to exceptionally high-achieving low-income students; 95 percent of Cooke Scholars graduate from these selective schools with top grades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today at selective colleges we have <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for the wealthy. More than 80 percent of the nation's top higher-education institutions give a ""legacy preference"" to children of alumni. Even the ""athletic preference"" has been warped to give the rich a better shot. Football and basketball - in which poor and minority children excel in large numbers - get the most exposure, but more student-athletes get a leg up at elite institutions in sports such as squash, sailing, crew, horseback riding, fencing and water polo. There aren't many water polo coaches in the New York City school system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The academic playing field is otherwise skewed against smart poor children. The wealthy student gets a tutor (or at least a test-prep course) and can submit his or her best scores to colleges after taking the SAT or ACT multiple times. In contrast, the child of poverty gets a single test-fee waiver and takes the test only once and ""cold."" (The College Board, to its credit, has sought to address the situation by offering Khan Academy test-prep services at no charge, which, although not the equivalent of one-on-one tutoring, is at least something.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Early-admissions programs that require a student to commit to attending a school if accepted also unfairly hold back the poor. Early admission is an easier path to acceptance, worth as much as an extra 100 SAT points, according to one report . But children of poverty can't apply early, because they can't commit to a particular school until they know how much their financial aid package will be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It goes on like this. Students from poverty are also often ill-advised by their high school counselors about college options. Public school counselors are stretched too thin - each advises, on average, hundreds of students - to give each student in-depth attention. So it is hardly surprising that only 23 percent of high-achieving low-income students even apply to a selective school, compared with more than twice as many - 48 percent - high-achieving students from families with higher incomes. As a result, many students are unaware of scholarships they are qualified to receive, and therefore don't apply to these seemingly expensive selective schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While some schools do make attempts to find high-performing low-income students, the overall impact is meager. To reduce the impact of the poverty penalty levied against the brightest low- income students, we need a serious poverty preference in admissions to elite colleges and universities - amounting to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for these students. We do not advocate reducing the role of standardized tests, because admissions officers must have a way to compare students across schools. Without reducing standardized test requirements, admissions officers need to give more credit to low-income students for having achieved at a high level despite not having the advantages of enrichment courses, internships and foreign travel. This would help to level the playing field and open the door of opportunity for academically qualified students to attend schools that match their abilities. It would also provide a backdoor way to maintain ethnic diversity in colleges, particularly if the Supreme Court does away with race-conscious <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in admissions in a case pending this term involving the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When many high-achieving low-income students apply to our nation's top institutions of higher learning, they face a far harder road than more affluent students. Rather than get credit for having successfully overcome obstacles, they face an even more arduous path. All young people in the United States should have a fair chance at academic success, based on true merit, regardless of how much money their parents have. Having wealthy parents doesn't make you smarter or more deserving of college admission. It just means you won the parent lottery.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Harold O.

5d89c4dd68f9d60001a21500	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421978637.xml.txt	"<div><p>Rehnquist's Mixed Legacy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sixteen men have served as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Some, like Melville W. Fuller, who presided from 1888 to 1910, inhabit the shadows of the court's history. Others, possessed of deeply held views and blessed with longevity or a favorable political wind at their backs, have touched Americans more profoundly than many presidents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fourth chief, John Marshall, was the first to leave his mark. It will surprise many people to learn that nothing in the Constitution explicitly authorizes the Supreme Court to decide whether acts of Congress are constitutional. In Marbury vs. Madison, Marshall deduced this power from the structure of government that the Constitution created -- and thus he created the institution of judicial review. More than a century later, Chief Justice Earl Warren led his colleagues to apply constitutional principles to outlaw racial segregation and to expand the rights of criminal defendants. Racial equality and the right to a lawyer may seem like obvious constitutional principles today; they didn't before Warren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When William H. Rehnquist joined the Supreme Court in 1972, he had ambitions that were similar in size but different in substance. Did he succeed? After 33 years on the court, the last 19 as its leader, Rehnquist's record is mixed. The Rehnquist court has slowed the expansion of civil rights but has not reversed it in most areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Victim of Cancer</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief justice has cancer and is mostly working from home. This comes after years of rumors that back troubles would force his resignation. The cancer diagnosis last fall intensified predictions of his impending retirement and sparked new discussions of his legacy and the court's future direction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist found his politics early, in dinner-table discussions with his Milwaukee parents and, after Pearl Harbor, as a neighborhood block captain responsible for reporting ""subversive activities"" to the police. His interest in history, forged in high school reenactments of the nation's founding, has endured in his writings, on the bench and off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those writings, Rehnquist will often hearken back to the period after the Civil War. Many think of the Reconstruction era as one of brutal repression of minorities and a pinched view of the federal government. Rehnquist, however, finds his legal and ideological touchstones in those years: states' rights, a narrow view of congressional authority and a bone-deep skepticism about the notion that law should protect private behavior. As a Supreme Court clerk, Rehnquist wrote memos urging his boss, Justice Robert H. Jackson, to dissent in voting-rights and school desegregation cases. Young Rehnquist scornfully dismissed pleas from criminal defendants. When Rehnquist became a justice himself, he took his own advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist has been least successful in the realm of private behavior. The abortion rights decision, Roe vs. Wade, came a year after he joined the court, and the core of that decision stands three decades later, despite Rehnquist's fierce opposition. The constitutional ban on school prayer also remains. Rehnquist's years saw the court uphold laws forbidding consensual sex among homosexuals and, over his objection, then saw the court reverse itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has had his successes. Rehnquist pushed the court to narrow or reverse many protections the Warren court had declared for criminal suspects, prisoners, racial minorities and students, boosting the authority of police, prosecutors, prison wardens and school officials. He and his colleagues struck down New Deal-era federal laws on the grounds that even the commerce clause of the Constitution -- formerly an all-purpose authority for the use of federal power -- did not authorize them. The Rehnquist court struck down laws concerning gun control, sexual assaults and cigarettes on this basis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States' Rights Booster</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sovereign authority of the states, by contrast, got a boost from Rehnquist. States are now largely free to execute murderers, destroy some inland wetlands and ponds, demote state employees who develop breast cancer or lock up some petty thieves for life, as California has chosen to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stopwatch efficiency that has earned Rehnquist high marks as the court's manager is also evident in his often-sparse opinions. Here it has not served him or the court as well. Instead of articulating principles that can guide judges and lawmakers, Rehnquist has often focused on the facts at hand. Your guess is as good as a constitutional scholar's about how the court will rule on any given <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> program. Why some terrorism suspects are entitled to legally challenge their confinement and others are not is similarly mysterious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist's most memorable accomplishment will probably be his most ignominious, and one of the most ""activist"" rulings in the court's history: essentially installing George W. Bush as president in the fatuously reasoned Bush vs. Gore. In the years before 2000, the Rehnquist court had rejected equal-protection claims from death row inmates complaining of racial bias, California homeowners challenging wide disparities in the property tax, gays and lesbians who wanted to serve in the military, and so on. But the same justices found that George W. Bush was a victim of an injustice worthy of the court's intervention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The selection of Rehnquist's successor, whenever it happens, will be a high-stakes battle. Both sides believe that important precedents, Roe among them, now hang on one vote. Rehnquist's replacement with another conservative may not much change the court's balance, but with eight of the nine justices over 65, the next vacancy could occur soon, allowing Bush to shift the court sharply right and finish the job Rehnquist started.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Jet helped launch the modern civil rights movement in 1955 when it published open-casket funeral photos of the mangled body of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Chicagoan who was savagely murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite its annual special editions focusing thoughtfully on major issues of black politics and economics, we black journalists, among others, often ridiculed the sugar-coated emphasis that Ebony and Jet put on the upwardly ambitious black middle class. Yet we also understood Johnson's reluctance to focus on negative news about black life, since there was so much of that in the mainstream media.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bourgeois flavor of Johnson's publications was a minor criticism in the life of a man who overcame tremendous hardships to fill an important vacuum in black life and become one of America's wealthiest businessmen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With that in mind, his ""make yourself indispensable"" speech had special resonance. Speaking to his audience of predominately young and aspiring print and broadcast journalists, he offered us the example of Matthew Henson, the black man who helped Adm. Robert Peary reach the North Pole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Henson was not hired under any <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> plan or out of the goodness of Peary's heart, Johnson pointed out. Henson was hired because he had taken the time to learn the language of the Inuit people, who were indispensable to their journey.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Johnson did not mention was the equally fascinating story of how he gave an autographed copy of Henson's autobiography to Zenith Electronics Corp. chief executive officer Eugene McDonald, after hearing that McDonald was a fan of arctic explorers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McDonald was impressed enough by the gift and by a four-page Ebony feature on Henson that Zenith became Ebony's first major corporate advertiser in the 1950s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He helped persuade other major corporate advertisers to follow, a major breakthrough at the time for black-oriented media. Two decades later, Johnson was elected to Zenith's board of directors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Johnson's career was full of stories like that. His life presents case studies in leadership, which is, above all, the art of problem solving. While others might fret, moan or whine, he was a get-it- done kind of guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He understood that no one, black or otherwise, would patronize your business purely out of racial loyalty. Consumers in a free market want value, service and quality. He set a high standard for all three. Despite the changing times that his publications helped to bring about, he found ways to stay indispensable. So must we all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clarence Page is a member of the Tribune's editorial board.

5d89c4dd68f9d60001a21500	test_question_neutral_testing_1	<p>Talking About Race in Akron</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid discussions about race are difficult even in intimate settings among well-acquainted people. For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>	stance:::Neutral			
5d89c4dd68f9d60001a21500	aa_opeds_sample/txt/419426239.xml.txt	"<div><p>THOMAS' INSPIRING COURAGE</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Every so often I question whether I've landed on the wrong planet. Or perhaps I've slipped into another dimension where perceptions are altered, where lies are truth, where yes means no, or the meaning of ""is"" is debatable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last Wednesday was one of those days. I was reading a New York Times columnist's accounting of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' speech at the American Enterprise Institute's dinner honoring him, and I wondered whether someone had spiked my water with some reality-altering chemical at my table.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the reliably witty Maureen Dowd described Thomas' speech as ""bellicose,"" ""self-pitying"" and ""self-aggrandizing,"" I described the same speech to friends as inspiring. Maybe it was the stirring rendition of ""America the Beautiful"" (I'm a shameless sucker for patriotic songs.), but I seem to have heard a different speech altogether.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is true, as Dowd pointed out, that the 1,600-person crowd was mostly white; that red meat was served and, presumably, eaten; that Thomas talked and talked and talked. But it is also true that no one stirred or so much as cleared his throat during the hour-long speech. And true, too, that Thomas' standing ovation at the end was longer than is required by politeness and more spontaneous than one might naturally expect of a crowd merely tired of sitting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From which I must infer that others in the throng heard the message of ""duty, honor, country"" as I did--as values worthy of the trenches and of our occasional discomfort. Nothing he said evoked ""comparisons to Bill Clinton's defense for pardoning Marc Rich when he said it was easy to say no and took courage to say yes,"" as Dowd wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It doesn't take courage to pardon an unscrupulous criminal in exchange for political favors and possibly huge sums of money, though corruption helps. It does take courage, on the other hand, to fight for your principles, to stand by your convictions, to tell the truth in your heart, as Thomas recommended throughout his speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's what Thomas really talked about, even as he acknowledged some personal understanding of these matters. He mentioned having experienced the firing line, from his Supreme Court confirmation hearings through media portrayals that were painful. He spoke, too, of his experiences as a black man who dares to question such ""black"" issues as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, school busing and welfare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Those who come to engage in debates of consequence, and who challenge accepted wisdom, should expect to be treated badly,"" he said. On issues of race, ""there was no real debate or honest discussion. When whites questioned the conventional wisdom on these issues, it was considered bad form; when blacks did so, it was treason.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Honest people know these words to be true, yet some would revile Thomas for saying them. Knowing that in advance--understanding that contradictory words will be greeted with personal attack and saying them anyway--requires the sort of courage Thomas was trying to advance that night and which surely he had to muster in order to make that speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As he made clear without bellicosity, it takes courage to participate in active citizenship. It takes courage to face down jeering crowds because you invite debate. It takes courage not to be cowed into the silence of self-censorship when brutes resort to in- your-face intimidation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one knows this better than Thomas, a black man who managed to navigate two American cultures, both black and white, in his odyssey from Pin Point, Ga., to the U.S. Supreme Court. That sort of journey takes courage. And though Thomas never said so, it also takes guts, which this man has to spare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kathleen Parker is a syndicated columnist based in South Carolina.

5d89c4dd68f9d60001a21500	aa_opeds_sample/txt/410325615.xml.txt	"<div><p>On Its 100th Birthday, Modern Israeli City Revels in Its Openness and Vibrancy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The city's story starts south of town in the ancient port of Jaffa, where the Old Testament says Jonah departed on the voyage that took him into the belly of a whale and the New Testament says Peter sorted out some of the basics of Christianity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's only an opening act. On a morning walk, tour guide Karl Walter is moving toward more contemporary events.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the walls of Old Jaffa came down in the late 1800s, people started moving to the countryside, he said. Muslims went in one direction, Christians in another. The Jews went north, to a few plots of sand on which they built a school and some houses and started what would become Tel Aviv  --  the first modern Jewish city and a destination for the earliest waves of Zionist immigrants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The city celebrates its centennial this year, its role in the nation changed from point of arrival for emigres to notorious party town and cultural and financial hub  --  a bit Manhattan, a bit L.A., a bit Ibiza, as a morning-to-dusk-to-dawn walk will show.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are those who consider it a fulfillment of Theodore Herzl's early Zionist vision  --  a Jewish city, yes, but one that has a strong bohemian streak, that's creative, tolerant and wide open in its politics. There are others who see it as a bit of an abomination, removed from the daily sense of conflict that runs through cities such as Jerusalem and a place, as one Israeli columnist called it, of ""mass Shabbat desecration.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 400,000 people live in the city proper. But close to half of the country's 7 million people live in Tel Aviv's suburbs or nearby coastal towns, so the dichotomy is a reflection not just of the city but of Israel itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tel Aviv  --  where David Ben-Gurion declared the Jewish state's independence  --  has seen its share of violence, including suicide bombings and Scud missiles launched by Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the southern Tel Aviv waterfront, Walter pointed out the stone house that used to belong to one of Jaffa's Arab leaders. It's in a field where, he said, Jewish forces converged in a battle on the eve of Ben-Gurion's declaration. The house is now a museum.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the Arab families were forced out or fled to the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and elsewhere. A few thousand remained, their descendants clustered in Jaffa neighborhoods that have since been incorporated into a combined municipality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as city conservation director Jeremie Hoffman said, the frame of reference is often different here than in other parts of Israel. Tel Aviv residents are as apt to identify with what's happening in New York and Paris as they are with the small towns of Israel, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hoffman's work is a case in point. In a country defined in some ways by ancient disputes, he is trying to preserve architecture that is only a few decades old  --  the Bauhaus apartments built by immigrants who imported the style from Europe in the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's mid-afternoon, and Hoffman is strolling through downtown neighborhoods where the city has imposed strict rules on renovating hundreds of Bauhaus buildings. The United Nations has designated the area a heritage zone. Apartments that once housed new arrivals are now million-dollar investments. This is not where the new immigrants come anymore  --  it is a second or third step, Hoffman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yael Dayan, chairman of the City Council, said rising property values are on her mind a lot lately. There's discussion of rent-control laws to ensure the city remains affordable for young people starting their careers as well as middle-class families.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She sips a late-afternoon coffee near Rabin Square, where Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995. The world's focus more often rests on Jerusalem, she said, but she's among those who will tell you that Tel Aviv is the heart of Israel's story.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This was Herzl's idea of what the Jewish land should be  --  secular, liberal, pluralistic,"" she said, citing the city's efforts to boost welfare benefits, care for the homeless, and encourage tolerance toward gays and other minorities. She winces a bit when asked about the status of Tel Aviv's Arab citizens, though she said the city has <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies for hiring Israeli Arabs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Tel Aviv is seen as very left-wing, but it keeps its distance,"" Arab mayoral candidate Asma Agbarieh-Zahalka said during her campaign. Redevelopment of some of Jaffa's older neighborhoods, she said, risked gentrifying the few Arab sections that remain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She did not receive many votes, but one person who supported her was writer Avner Bernheimer, who felt putting an Arab woman in charge of the city might stir things up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is just past sundown on Friday night, the start of the Jewish Sabbath. Jerusalem and other more conservative towns are locked up tight to observe the day of rest. In Tel Aviv, it's the start of a party that will run into the early hours.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bernheimer and his partner, architect Eran Neuman, are talking over dinner about their projects. Bernheimer is writing a television movie about human trafficking through the Sinai desert. Neuman has put together one of the centennial celebration's centerpiece displays, a futuristic look at Tel Aviv in which ideas from architecture schools worldwide are pictured on brightly lit, inflatable triangles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But some of the most animated talk over dinner is of their  3-month-old son  --  the mother is a college friend of Neuman's, and Bernheimer is the biological father. Just as it was built on refugees from Europe, they say, Tel Aviv today is a result of its openness  --  to gays, to people with different ideas about politics or art, to those with ambitions they feel they can fulfill here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Friday night becomes Saturday morning. There are discos, clubs and bars tucked into so many alleys. People line up for the most popular.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the Blackbook, two men in NBA jerseys and Elvis wigs are waving sex toys in the face of an unfortunate friend celebrating a birthday. At club Haarbaa, around the corner, Yair Gafni is a natural host. He treats everyone like his long-lost friend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nearing sunrise, fruit bats nibble at the ficus trees. There are still crowds on some of the streets, huddled around a pizza or sipping drinks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no last call.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Washington Post Foreign Service</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
5d89c4dd68f9d60001a21500	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2230209410.xml.txt	"<div><p>Editorial Observer; Hell Hath No Fury Like a Conservative Who Is Victorious</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lino Graglia was standing in a meeting room at the Mayflower Hotel, and he was hopping mad. The only question was, Why?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia, a self-described ''far right'' law professor at the University of Texas, was attending the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala at what could only be called a triumphal moment. The Federalist Society, a group of conservative lawyers and academics, has emerged from obscurity to become perhaps the most powerful force in the law today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over four days of panels and soirees, the Federalists were the toast of official Washington. Members of the Bush cabinet, including Attorney General John Ashcroft, joined in the festivities. And Justice Antonin Scalia mused to a packed banquet hall, ''Who would have thought 20 years ago that that little organization of students at a couple of law schools would have evolved today to a power of such proportions?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the legal panels, administration officials fell over themselves to say what the crowd wanted to hear. At a business-law panel, a top Justice Department lawyer talked about settling the Microsoft antitrust case, a move applauded by conservatives, who saw the suit as Clinton-era interference with the prerogatives of big business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But to Mr. Graglia, the administration's business-friendly line sounded like so much liberal claptrap. During the question period, he demanded to know why the administration was bothering to enforce antitrust laws at all. ''It really is time to be bold,'' he insisted. ''The boldest thing to do would be to repeal all the laws.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia wasn't the only conservative who was suffering. A woman stood up to declare herself ''dissatisfied and frustrated'' because the panel had not attacked the states for suing tobacco companies. A law professor fulminated against state attorneys general, like Eliot Spitzer of New York, who, by crusading to clean up the Enrons and WorldComs of the world, have become self-appointed securities commissioners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I must admit that when I headed down to Washington last week, I was expecting to encounter a good deal of gloating. The last time I spent any time with the Federalist Society crowd was on the Harvard Law Review, where a claque of right-leaning law students used to hang out late into the evening, grumbling about <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and the New Deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now this same crowd is setting the nation's legal policy and selecting its judges -- with a freer hand than ever since the Republicans retook the Senate. They are using their informal network to place conservative true believers in influential positions throughout the federal government, from Supreme Court clerkships to top agency posts. In fact, one of the late-night Harvard Law Review grumblers from way back when, Miguel Estrada, is now a Federalist Society favorite for the next vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the Federalists' remarkable good fortune, I had expected the banter to be heavy with congratulations and plans for the future. But much of the rumbling in the hallways was of grudges' being lovingly nursed and of potshots' being fired against liberal enemies long ago vanquished.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before one event, a graybeard in the audience tutored a wet-behind-the-ears Federalist on the horrors of Travelgate, in which the Clinton White House did -- well, nothing much, really. At the black-tie banquet, a satirical song took aim at ''Brennan, Marx and Lenin.'' William Brennan, the Supreme Court justice who was being gleefully branded a communist, died in 1997.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The search for fictive liberal enemies reached a loopy low on the convention's last day, when an archconservative federal appeals court judge, Laurence Silberman, accused William Rehnquist's archconservative Supreme Court of having a secret plan to declare the death penalty unconstitutional. In an opinion just last month, the court reiterated its view that capital punishment is constitutional even for 16-year-olds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the event that most captured the spirit of the week was Kenneth Starr's speech and his introduction by Barbara Comstock, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Public Affairs. Between them, Ms. Comstock and Mr. Starr managed to rail against Bill Clinton, James Carville, Lanny Davis, James Jeffords, Alan Dershowitz, the Warren court, trial lawyers and Barbra Streisand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Starr was particularly exercised about liberals' being result-oriented, abandoning their principles to reach the outcomes they favor. But he would have made a more compelling case if he had not proceeded to abandon his -- and the Federalist Society's -- own oft-repeated commitment to judicial restraint to praise the Supreme Court for striking down the Gun-Free School Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act in a burst of conservative activism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was the take-away, as meeting planners like to say, from the Federalist Society's big convention? First, if these are the folks choosing federal judges for the Bush administration -- and they are -- Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans need to be vigilant about investigating nominees' backgrounds, and using the filibuster, to prevent a far-right takeover of the courts. Second, Democrats and moderate Republicans in both houses will need to stand up for mainstream principles that are now under assault, like antitrust law and health and safety regulations. And finally, a point of sportsmanship: the only thing less appealing than a sore loser is a sore winner.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

I am grateful to the State Transportation Department for putting together for me an accounting of how much has been spent so far on the court-stalled Westway project and who has received the money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Transportation Department has been in charge of overseeing the 4.2-mile superhighway-waterfront development to replace the crumbled West Side Highway in lower Manhattan - a construction opus that was once estimated to cost $1.4 billion but is now projected at $4 billion or more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To date, the state agency reported, $75 million has been spent, out of $100 million authorized, on the preliminary planning and construction work - and much more is to come. The last time an accounting of this groundwork spending appeared in public print - in a story in this newspaper four years ago - the figure was only $18 million out of the $21 million allocated - so the engineers and consultants and contractors have been, so to speak, active.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ninety percent of the money has come from the Federal Highway Trust Fund and 10 percent from the state - which has led some of the promoters of the project to behave as if it will cost us next to nothing. But there is no guarantee from Congress that the rest of the project would be fully funded by this 90-10 formula; the indications, in fact, have been to the contrary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I felt it would be instructive if I reproduced here the salient portions of the Transportation Department's spending list.

To avoid charges of partisanship, let an independent third party put titles and summaries on initiatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Words matter. And when those words appear on the ballot, where space is limited and the competition for voter attention is high, they matter a lot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This has become an issue for a group of Republicans who have proposed a ballot initiative to repeal a recently passed package of gas taxes and vehicle fees. On Friday, they sued California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, claiming his office put a partisan spin on the title it gave their initiative. Instead of describing the initiative in a straightforward way, saying something like ""Repeals the gas tax,"" the title says instead: ""Eliminates recently enacted road repair and transportation funding by repealing revenues dedicated for those purposes. ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The description is accurate, as far as it goes. And even though the words ""taxes"" and ""fees"" don't appear in the title, they do appear in the summary that goes directly after the title on the signature petitions and on the ballot, if it qualifies. Anyone taking the time to read through the petition before signing it would figure out what the measure was all about.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the title is clunky and manages to avoid the simple and direct words that would clarify what the initiative actually does. Worse yet, the initiative's proponents believe that the language was made intentionally opaque to weaken the measure's support.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ballot proponents do not get to dictate the titles that go with their proposals, but there was no reason this title had to be so tortured. Does that mean the word choice was politically motivated? Not necessarily. It could merely be the result of having been written by lawyers. Ultimately, it will be up to a judge to decide whether Becerra should rewrite the title and summary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But such complaints are unnecessarily common in situations where an attorney general from one party prepares the language for a ballot initiative pushed by people in the other party. State law gives the attorney general the responsibility of writing ""true and impartial"" titles and summaries without creating ""prejudice, for or against the proposed measure."" Nevertheless, more than a couple of attorneys general have been accused of choosing -- or omitting -- words for the ballot title or summary to make a political point or to sway voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, former Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, a Republican, was sued for his decision not to include the hot button words ""<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>"" in the summary of Proposition 209, the controversial 1996 ballot measure that ended state <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs. Former Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat, was accused of bias when she wrote the summary for a pension reform proposal. Jerry Brown, when he served as attorney general, was criticized for the language he used to describe Proposition 8, the same-sex marriage initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a pretty simple solution: Give the duty to a nonpartisan third party. This idea has cropped up periodically in recent years, but hasn't gone anywhere. The most recent proposal, by Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Roseville), would reassign the writing of ballot titles and summaries to the Legislative Analyst's Office. The proposal (which would itself be in the form of a ballot initiative) was supported by California Common Cause and the League of Women Voters of California. But it was opposed by Becerra and died in its first committee hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kiley's bill may be dead, but this is an idea that ought to be given serious consideration by both parties. The LAO has done an admirable job of writing clear, concise and apolitical analyses of proposed legislation. It stands to reason the LAO would produce ballot titles and summaries with the same non-partisan balance and clarity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's bad enough that the titles of ballot measures are often vague and unhelpful. (Just consider two competing measures on the November statewide ballot: Proposition 62, titled simply ""Death Penalty,"" and Proposition 66, with the title ""Death Penalty. Procedures."" Only when voters read the summary did it become clear that one measure proposed ending the death penalty in California and the other proposed speeding it up.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters shouldn't have to wonder also if those titles are a product of political spin.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

The growing number of jobs lost to this crafty creature that seems to be nowhere and everywhere at once is startling enough to make us question our assumptions about how to plan a future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the goal was once to ensure a college education for everyone, the more prudent policy now might be to help people develop skills related to outdoor work and other physically demanding jobs. Chatbots can write, but they can't change a lightbulb. They can't plumb a house. They can't heal the sick with a human touch or grow vegetables or perform countless other jobs that fill humanity's most crucial needs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the confused, ""GPT"" stands for ""generative pre-trained transformer,"" which refers to how ChatGPT processes, requests and formulates responses. ChatGPT is trained via reinforcement and reward models that rank the best responses. Something like that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the reasoning behind the high court's 6-3 decision on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is best left to lawyers - speaking of replaceable professions - the implications of the explosive expansion of AI into new arenas should be obvious to anyone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During a visit with my son, I brought up the subject of AI, and he quickly begged for a subject change. ""I don't want to talk about it,"" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Why not?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Because it upsets me.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, he has reason to be worried. A writer with a law degree, he depends on regular clients to earn a living. He's fine for now, thanks to his unique niche, but other writers similarly situated have lost their entire client lists overnight. Post tech reporters Pranshu Verma and Gerrit De Vynck recently described a Bloomingdale, Ill., writer, Eric Fein, whose clients - all of them - notified him that they were ""transitioning"" to AI. Is anyone not transitioning these days?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fein has returned to school to become an HVAC technician. Another displaced writer, this one in San Francisco, has started a job as a dog walker.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amid the disruption, irony remains fully employed. Is technology, in replacing humans, also making us more human? More time spent outdoors is surely healthier than sitting at a desk for hours a day. If more people turn to skilled labor, might we finally be able to find dependable help on household troubles beyond our ken?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A forthcoming ""wearable AI assistant"" from a company called Humane is meant to revolutionize both technology and humanity. Imran Chaudhri, Humane's co-founder and chairman, describes his pocket-size invention as intentionally humanizing, because it eliminates the need for devices - smart phones, watches, even computers - that act as barriers to human interaction. Chaudhri's device performs the functions of all the above and more, using the palm of the hand as a display screen so your face is free to express emotions, make eye contact and, not least, see where you're going.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such developments are both frightening and exhilarating. The possibilities for liberation and creativity are limited only by the imagination. But the threat to life as we know it - and especially to white-collar (or work-at-home-hoodie) jobs - is potentially catastrophic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the bright side, AI isn't always so smart. Or, rather, it's smart in a Vulcan way. All brain, no emotion, makes for a lousy human. Writers can be replaced if all you need is a user manual, but AI doesn't have the emotional depth or experiential memory to write beautifully, using just the right word or nuance. An algorithm might come up with the likeliest word used by most people most of the time, but a good writer knows better ones. Voice and style are as individual as a fingerprint.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least one of Fein's clients has realized that his content was better than AI's and has returned. Others decided that the quality sacrifice was worth the cost savings. Humans, after all, need steady salaries and health benefits, vacations, sick days and family leave. AI needs nothing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can't at this point see exactly how AI might evolve. We know instinctively that the good often is shadowed by the bad. How many ways will we regret our eager embrace of machine over man? Of such is science fiction written, though I suspect AI would be a lousy author. Great literature comes to us from people who have dug deep into their psyches, experiences, sorrows, triumphs, fears, losses and aspirations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do wonder about all the folks who no longer will be admitted to colleges and universities because they don't meet certain data-driven standards and, therefore, won't have the opportunity to study humankind's greatest achievements.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The immediate losers will be the students of color who might have benefited from <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. But in the longer run, the real loser might well be academia. Young men already have abandoned college in huge numbers, leaving women to dominate in many fields that AI loves. Add Black and Brown young people to decreasing enrollments and who's left? And who will teach? AI, I'm afraid.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court says <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> belongs to another generation and is no longer needed. It would be nice to think so, but my hunch is that many Americans would agree with Suzanne Szostak, co-innkeeper of Mine + Farm, my favorite getaway here in Sonoma County.

He is telling us that were he not such an empathetic and benevolent president, African Americans would be far worse off. He suggests that no other president has shown such generosity to a group of people as helpless as we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I now know the cause of my indignation. Trump sounds like a slave master proclaiming that he is good to his Negroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To keep their slaves submissive, the masters would threaten to sell them to less compassionate owners if they got out of line. ""I have done more for the Black community"" sounds like a slave owner claiming that he's a good master because he doesn't beat his slaves as often or cut off their feet to stop them from fleeing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a racist, self-gratifying pronouncement that was passed down through generations of prominent white people who held power over African Americans. It was prevalent in the South during the 1960s, when Black women largely were domestic workers cleaning homes and caring for the children of white employers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was not uncommon for a white woman to brag to her friends about how good she was to her help. Though she paid wages too small to live on, she rewarded her ""girl"" with items from her home -- discarded furniture, clothing and trinkets that Black people struggling to put food on the table would never buy for themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump wants us to understand that even the first Black president, Barack Obama, couldn't fix our problems. Only someone like him -- white with an abundance of intellect -- could lead us to the Promised Land. But there's only so much he can do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's comments reflect the racist, stereotypical attitude he and others in his circle espouse about the Black community. He sees African Americans as violently barbaric people and describes our neighborhoods as ""living in hell.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has written us off as too dumb to understand how we have created these conditions ourselves. And he is losing patience with us because we refuse to acknowledge all that he does for us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, expressed it more bluntly. Appearing Monday on ""Fox & Friends,"" Kushner brought up the old racist adage that Black people can't succeed to the heights of white people because they don't want to be successful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""One thing we've seen in a lot of the Black community, which is mostly Democrat, is that President Trump's policies are the policies that can help people break out of the problems that they're complaining about,"" said Kushner, a top White House adviser. ""But he can't want them to be successful more than they want to be successful.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kushner went on to suggest that African Americans would rather complain than do what is necessary to improve their lives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, the white savior in the Oval Office has broken his back trying to help Black people, while we are being lazy and shiftless. This came from someone who came up in his father's business and is only in his prominent position because he is married to the president's daughter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The hypocrisy of both Kushner and Trump, who inherited wealth from his father, is astounding. It shows complete ignorance when it comes to the interplay between race and economics in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It overlooks the impressive achievements of large numbers of African Americans in spite of a system that historically has offered little or no assistance. It also ignores that this same system has successfully fought to tear down equalizers such as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> that sought to provide a bridge to economic parity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Speaking at Stanford University in 2017, Harvard University sociologist William Julius Wilson pointed out that the income of more affluent African Americans was increasing prior to Trump taking office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When adjusted for inflation, the percentage of African Americans earning at least $75,000 more than doubled to 21% from 1970 to 2014, he said. Those making $100,000 or more nearly quadrupled to 13%. In contrast, white Americans saw a less impressive increase, from 11 to 26%, he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By no means does that indicate that African Americans have reached economic parity in this county. In fact, we remain far from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it does prove that Trump is not the savior to Black people he claims to be. More so, it shows that African Americans can do, and always have done, a lot better without him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>dglanton@chicagotribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter @dahleeng</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CREDIT: Dahleen Glanton</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports	
6287748198aa98c765deff27	test_question_against_testing_1	<p>TESTING THE WATERS DROPPING THE SAT WOULD MEAN FAILING STUDENTS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Got a weight problem? Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>				stance:::Against/Opposes

That's not my view. That's the assessment of Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Bush political appointee before he became head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who says that looming financial calamities in Medicare and Medicaid are larger and more immediate worries in a strictly budgetary sense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As economic calamities go, more significant crises confront the states, which are responsible for our kids' education; the nation's hospitals, which bear the brunt of an overburdened health care system; and international institutions, which have to deal with famine, poverty and HIV/AIDS.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With all these pressing woes, how did Social Security, Terri Schiavo's end-of-life fight and judicial nominations make it to the top of the Washington agenda? It's not merely because the White House or the party in power wants them to be there. It's because deep-rooted, well-heeled organizations have been targeting those issues for years. What seems like serendipity to the public  --  why is Congress talking about trial lawyers again?  --  is more often the result of an interest group's advance work combining with the right circumstances to send an issue hurtling into the limelight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, we increasingly live in a stage-managed democracy where highly orchestrated interests filter our priorities. These groups don't have absolute power, of course. In the nation's capital, home to 30,000 registered lobbyists, hundreds of politicians, thousands of journalists and untold numbers of entrenched bureaucrats, no one's in charge. But long-established entities like the AARP, the Family Research Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce mold our collective thinking and regularly dictate the language and tenor of our civic debates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This notion runs counter to an abiding myth  --  that political leaders actually lead. That's  true sometimes, of course, but more often than not, the ideas and movements that get on the government's to-do list come from the broad middle and not from the top.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A case in point: More than a decade ago, the National Federation of Independent Business, the country's premier small-business lobby, began to methodically contact its half-million members by phone and mail to categorize them by political leanings and their willingness to contact federal lawmakers. The lobby group trained its most eager members at local seminars and sent staffers door-to-door during elections in critical congressional districts. Regular ""grass- roots"" outpourings from this made-to-order machine vaulted NFIB- championed issues onto center stage  --  especially when the Republicans it favored took control of the White House and Congress. In particular, the inheritance tax (which NFIB loyalists redubbed the ""death tax"" for marketing purposes) was repealed (temporarily so far, but Congress is now considering whether to make the repeal permanent). This was the organization's No. 1 priority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The process is a lot like surfing. Interest groups float along, waiting for the perfect wave of public sentiment or official fiat to carry their issues to victory. They can't create the wave, but they can be ready for the moment when it comes. The key is to be prepared for that moment: Not every issue has an organization with the wealth and staying power to be in that position. Those that do have a shot at winning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Lobbying is subtle and complicated,"" says John W. Kingdon, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan who studies interest groups. But the most important attribute of a successful lobbying campaign, he says, is persistence --  something that only entrenched organizations possess.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It takes a sustained organization, mobilized followers and an immense amount of power to get onto a legislative agenda,"" agrees Theodore J. Lowi, a professor of government at Cornell University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, interest groups have replaced political parties as the real influence brokers. Candidates for office rely on these groups for campaign cash, for campaign workers and, increasingly, for campaign issues  --  all of which had once been the domain of the Republican and Democratic national committees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican ground troops come from such diverse groups as the NFIB, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Family Research Council and the National Rifle Association. Democratic soldiers are recruited from places like labor unions, the trial bar and Moveon.org. ""The standard distinction between interest groups and parties used to be that parties were committed to winning elections and that pressure groups let elections happen and then tried to influence the people who got elected,"" Lowi said. ""Now interest groups through their PACs and a variety of other methods are very much involved in the pre- policy arena.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such involvement has become a prime factor in agenda-setting. Take Social Security. Few federal programs attract as much scrutiny. AARP, the nation's largest lobbying organization, is dedicated to keeping Social Security alive and well, as are groups such as the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The reason: Large portions of their membership depend on Social Security checks to survive in old age. AARP has taught a million and a half of its 35 million members how to hammer elected officials by mail, phone and in person, primarily about Social Security.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But AARP has learned that it needs to be careful what it wishes for. Its obsession with the issue has made Social Security a front- of-the-mind topic and, therefore, a perennial contender to shoot to Washington's upper tier. Ideological opponents of the current Social Security system have also been active, raising the issue's profile even higher. Free market think tanks such as the Cato Institute and anti-tax-increase lobbies have been churning out position papers for a quarter-century promoting partial privatization of Social Security as a way to undercut what they see as ""big government."" One appreciator of that work: George W. Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So when the president went looking for a problem to solve that could guarantee him a lasting legacy  --  and, perhaps, realign party domination  --  he went for that old chestnut Social Security. He also embraced a proposal that AARP dislikes  --  the creation of private accounts. That notion has fallen flat largely because of more than $15 million worth of AARP advertising against it. When the process moves to another phase and compromises are explored, AARP is likely to become an important negotiator and perhaps the key indicator of whether the effort will succeed or fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same high-stakes maneuvering couldn't have happened with, say, Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, even though it's in more dire financial straits. Medicaid doesn't have similarly situated citizens' groups beating the bushes on its behalf. So while saving Social Security is the watchword of the day, Medicaid's fate will be to languish and occasionally fend off budget cuts until its finances reach an emergency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Terri Schiavo is another example of interest-group politics at work. The 41-year-old brain-damaged woman was in many ways not out of the ordinary. She was one of thousands of people whose families annually struggle with the question of when a relative's life has ended. But skilled marketers on the well-established, pro-life side of the abortion debate seized on her situation. The National Right to Life Committee, Operation Rescue, Priests for Life, the Family Research Council and others set up Web sites, held news conferences and raised lots of money for lawyers and for themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their pleas touched a chord with millions of Americans and made Schiavo's plight a cause celebre. The omnipresence of her situation in direct-mail communications from those groups and on talk radio made her synonymous with the battle over life and death issues of all kinds  --  from the womb to the grave. By the time Schiavo's parents had finally exhausted their legal options and her feeding tube was about to be removed permanently, the public policy pump had been thoroughly primed. Republican leaders sympathetic to the cause brought Congress back for an extraordinary weekend session. Only later did it appear, based on various polls, that the majority of Americans did not see Schiavo's case the way the Republican leadership did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, the starvation of a solitary middle-class woman in Florida riveted government for a couple of weeks while similar  --  and more severe  --  situations went almost unnoticed. Mass starvation in Sudan, for instance, was a legislative footnote by comparison. Why? It's not only that Sudan is far away and hard to solve. Help for the Sudan catastrophe lacks the backing of as many obsessively focused and widely dispersed interest groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The brewing battle in the Senate over a mere seven judicial nominees is another telling example. Groups on the political left and right are making the coming confrontation seem like World War III. (Witness the use of the word ""nuclear"" to describe the Republicans' effort to force a vote.) In fact, the debate is a warm- up for the more consequential conflict over filling the next Supreme Court vacancy as well as a stand-in for other divisive issues, such as gay rights, abortion rights and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why such tumult and passion? Organizations with wide and longstanding interest have been on the prowl for supporters on these matters for years. On the anti-Bush side are the Alliance for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and People for the American Way, which was instrumental in derailing Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. The president's allies include groups such as the Committee for Justice, Focus on the Family, the Federalist Society, Americans for Tax Reform and FreedomWorks, which have not only raised millions for the purpose but coordinate their activities in conference calls among their leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an odd way, all this attention to Washington ways is heartening. The common view is that elites run the show and sheep- like citizens allow them to. In fact, organized interests able to motivate blocs of voters really can make a difference, as long as they can stick around for a while.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, not every vital issue has a group or groups that are clever or rich enough to generate unrelenting support from back home. That leaves out of the mix too many people with worthy woes: the unemployed, the uninsured, the unaligned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's probably an opportunity there for yet another powerful interest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Author's e-mail:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kstreetconfidential@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jeffrey Birnbaum is a Post reporter whose</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>K Street Confidential column on the intersection of business and politics appears on alternate Mondays in the Business section.

Things happen. Hillsides erupt. Trends emerge. New stars are born, as old ones are escorted to the quiz shows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Change is the one constant of California life, or so sing the gilded poets. And yet at times it seems nothing ever changes at all. Like the poppies, certain plot lines keep coming back again and again, the perennials of the public scene. Like the smog, some never go away at all. Water is one obvious example.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The generals of hydraulics are at it again, warring this time over Colorado River water. The stakes, as always, are huge and the details, as always, are complex. The fundamental issue, though, is the same as always: Water, water, who gets the water? There never has been, and never will be, enough water for California--except when it floods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, the politics of the place adhere to familiar patterns. From the earliest days, California vote-seekers have campaigned against the Other. In the mid-1800s, it was ""John,"" code name for the Chinese laborers. There were the Pikes, followed by the Okies, and the Hollywood Reds, and the welfare queens, and Mexican field workers, and the beneficiaries of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Does anyone doubt that, given the mounting political ruckus over the Asian connection, the next election will be a contest to determine which candidates know the fewest Chinese?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This sense of repetition can be annoying to journalists. News is supposed to be a self-defining term, but after the 10th dog is bitten by a boy, the headlines can feel a little too familiar. Cynicism begins to invade the journalistic immune system, a dangerous development in that the truly cynical journalist is but one bad day away from a second career as press agent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All that said, it still seems not at all difficult to imagine what headlines await Californians beyond that bridge to the New Millennium. Five years from now--or 10, 15, 25, even 50 years from now--the news will be full of water wars and wedge issues and O.J. Simpson's new quarters at the rest home. B-1 Bob Dornan, or his lawful heirs, will be demanding a recount. Jerry Brown will be rumored to be contemplating a run for something, anything. Peter Ueberroth will be rumored to be a candidate for a job he doesn't want.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A seismic engineer will be expressing concern about the L.A. Coliseum press box. Tunneling for the Metro Red Line will be stalled somewhere under the city. A California councilman will be shown amid the scorched rubble of a canyon, declaring the time has come to crack down on roof shingles. A county supervisor will visit a submerged subdivision, declaring the time has come to crack down on flood plain development. Los Angeles will be fighting over its police chief.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Dodgers will need a third baseman. Al Davis will be threatening to move his Fort Worth Raiders to Frankfurt. Food critics will be predicting that Los Angeles cuisine finally is about to come of age. Sylvester Stallone will announce he is now seeking serious roles. And Liz Taylor will be home from Cedars, weakened by the operation, but holding up well for a 145-year-old. Her fiance will stand at the gate, shooing away paparazzi.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perennials can provide a sense of security. That every spring the feature writers return on schedule to San Juan Capistrano is somehow reassuring. It was comforting to read the other day in the Fresno Bee that San Joaquin Valley raisin growers are about to embark on yet another promotional campaign. Their conviction that the world is but one catchy advertisement away from succumbing to raisin mania has been a staple of reportage in raisinland since William Saroyan was a boy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some never-ending stories, however, grow tedious, as unwelcome as weeds. Tales of the latest gang to terrorize the streets, or the latest crackpot to invade the family planning clinic, or the latest measurement of public school decline--any novelty wore off sad old chestnuts such as these long ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, new crops do keep pushing up. Politicians in particular are adept at developing the fresh controversies that news requires. Currently in the state Capitol, debate rages over gambling and how to control card rooms and reservation casinos. This story line holds tremendous evergreen potential, as all sides seem willing to throw huge amounts of cash at the legislators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As long as combatants are willing to donate, politicians will be willing to debate their issue, on and on, but without conclusion. ""We don't kill milk cows up here,"" is how one Sacramento consultant has described this phenomenon.

I have never doubted Ashcroft's decency, never questioned his legal abilities, never worried that, in a particular case, he would be unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the attorney general is not just the nation's chief cop. He is also the chief influencer of our law-enforcement policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is from that office that decisions are made on which laws to enforce, and how vigorously; what discretion ought to be exercised, and in which direction; how law-enforcement resources should be deployed, and with what emphases. Bland reassurances that Ashcroft would ""enforce the law fairly"" aren't much help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take a simple example, what does it mean to enforce America's drug laws ""fairly""? Does it mean locking up anybody caught with illegal drugs, as the law permits? Does it mean focusing resources on major traffickers, as the law also permits? Does it mean shifting resources from enforcement to treatment -- or the other way around? Does it mean confiscating more and more assets of people found in violation of the drug laws? The law allows all these things -- allows as well the disparate sentencing for powdered and ""crack"" cocaine and the well-documented racial disparity that results from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To promise to enforce the law without talking about which policies would be emphasized or changed is to say nothing at all. Absent a president with strong feelings on the matter,  law-enforcement policy is largely left to attorneys general to decide. Some have gone against discrimination, some against organized crime, some against monopolies and trusts. Some have followed public sentiment, and some have gone their own way. Most of the time, it hasn't mattered much. So why do so many non-conservatives believe it will matter so much this time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The answer is in Ashcroft's record of advocacy. He has fought with extraordinary vigor for positions that are well outside the American mainstream -- on gun control, on abortion, on juvenile justice, on the death penalty. I don't mean to deny that his position on all these issues might be shared by a significant minority. I say only that his views are unusually conservative. He is, I think it fair to say, an ideologue. And when you take someone who has been advocating views that are well away from the political center and put him in charge of law-enforcement policy, it's not enough to say he'll ""enforce the law.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ashcroft signaled his own understanding of this point when he was asked whether he would try to undermine the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion. He said that for the solicitor general (who ranks under the attorney general) to petition the Supreme Court to have another look at Roe would undermine the Justice Department's standing before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, as I read his response, saying he could make the attempt, though it might be impolitic to do so at this time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is it unfair to oppose Ashcroft, an experienced lawyer, out of fear that his personal and religious views would influence his role as attorney general?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) reminded us the other day, it is a question Ashcroft himself has answered. When Bill Lann Lee was named by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, Ashcroft fought to deny him the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He had no doubt concerning the nominee's professional ability, Ashcroft said at the time, but Lee's beliefs (on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>) ""limit his capacity to have the balanced view of making judgments that will be necessary for the person who runs the division.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why can't the same assessment apply to the person who will run the whole department?</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

While the Coalition for an Anti-Sexist Harvard rallied outside the science center, a hastily formed group with the laid-back name Students for Larry was milling about Lowell Lecture Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the crisis wasn't just about Larry Summers. Gendergate -- to give the scandal its obligatory suffix -- was more than a matter of an impolitic president. At stake is the university's very identity: Is Harvard liberal or conservative?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one associated with the university, of course, would ever admit to thinking about it that way. How could such basic terms fit, given Harvard's image of itself as an institution that celebrates independence of beliefs and political affiliations as the essence of its charter? And not without justification: It can tenure Harvey Mansfield, the professor of government famous for his politically incorrect pronouncements, and Hilary Putnam, the philosophy professor who was handing out Progressive Labor pamphlets 35 years ago and seems not to have changed his mind on any issue since?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet why should we expect Harvard, and Harvard alone, to rise above the fray? Every issue on campus, just like every issue on every other campus, is refracted through the lens of left-right politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The number of tenured women professors there? Shockingly low, and it must be fixed by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, liberals insist. The result of fewer women getting on tenure track early in their careers, conservatives retort.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expansion of the campus to Allston? An imperial land grab, the liberals say, that ignores the needs of the surrounding community. A way to create a vibrant Silicon Valley on the Charles, conservatives argue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this way, the conflagration at Harvard simply mirrors the other wars happening elsewhere -- most recently at Hamilton College, which became embroiled in a debate over a University of Colorado professor's right to call the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks ''little Eichmanns.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harvard being Harvard, any debate it provokes is certain to draw widespread attention. But there is also this crucial difference: the conservative agitator is not an outsider, but an insider. In this case, the president himself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not that Mr. Summers thinks of himself as a conservative. He was Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and before that, chief economist of the World Bank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's made Mr. Summers so controversial, said Nicholas Lemann, a Harvard graduate and now the dean of Columbia University's journalism school, is that he's conservative ''not in his politics, but in the context of the university.'' ''Just about everything he's done that's gotten attention is about a tug to the center,'' Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is to say, he would like to see R.O.T.C., which was banished from Harvard during the sit-ins of the 60's, restored to campus; he would like to overhaul the core curriculum; he would like to hire who he pleases, regardless of race or sex.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By being naturally and deliberately provocative, he has challenged campus liberals, which is not what campus liberals are accustomed to. Neil Rudenstine, the previous president, was a former English major devoted to inclusivity. Derek Bok, who preceded Mr. Rudenstine, was an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> proponent, even writing a book after he left office on the merits of race-based preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, Mr. Summers has had a series of widely reported confrontations: He rebuked Cornel West, a distinguished professor in the African-American studies department, who promptly decamped to Princeton; he made the suggestion, provoked by a pro-Palestinian faction demanding that Harvard divest itself of stock in companies allied with Israel, that campus anti-Semitism was on the rise; he deplored rampant grade inflation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The right attributed his problems to ''feminists'' furthering their ''career agendas,'' as Professor Mansfield put it: ''That he's not in favor of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, that's what this whole thing is about.'' The left complained that he was a dictatorial bully.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the considerable endowment -- now about $23 billion -- is subject to a left-right critique. Liberals want to know why more of that money isn't used for scholarships and faculty research. And why, they ask, are top money managers earning Wall Street-size bonuses? Critics of what some refer to as ''the corporatization of Harvard'' point to the university's acquisition of significant real estate holdings in Allston as symptomatic of the trend. For decades now, Harvard has been buying land across the river from the main campus, and now owns 260 acres there, leaving the university open to the charge that it has pursued a policy of expansion out of sheer acquisitiveness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Harvard started out as a public school,'' notes Lani Guinier, a Harvard law professor and the author of a forthcoming book titled ''Meritocracy Incorporated.'' ''It was given land by the state of Massachusetts. Harvard was a proprietor of Cambridge, charged with the responsibility of answering to the needs of the community. It's one thing to be the wealthiest landowner in the community, but you have to be responsible.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some extent, the campus rift is not about politics, but about a wrenching of power from the faculty. When Mr. Summers was appointed in 2001, he had, or believed he had, a mandate to make the university more efficient by exerting his control over it. ''He's interested in everything,'' says Kim Clark, dean of the Harvard Business School. ''How it runs its real estate operation, how it manages its food service, how it allocates resources.'' (''Academic freedom is wonderful,'' Mr. Summers has said, ''but it doesn't really have a place in the purchase of cement.'')</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not as if the travails of Lawrence Summers pose any threat to the continuance of the university. Harvard has weathered turbulence before in its 370-year history. Not even the travails of a president who seems to lack a superego can match the drama of that dawn in the spring of 1969 when President Nathan Pusey called in state troopers to oust students who had occupied University Hall; no one present will ever forget the cloud of tear gas wafting over Harvard Yard at five o'clock in the morning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the issues the university faces -- the fate of the new Allston campus, the overhaul of the curriculum, the proper use of the endowment -- are hardly minor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real question isn't whether Mr. Summers should stay or go, but how these inevitable transformations will play out over the next few years. Like it or not, the university over which he presides has been swept into this decade's culture war. There are some things from which not even Harvard is exempt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Drawing by Adam Palmer)</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

One whose ranks and command structure are dominated by non-Hispanic whites? Or one whose makeup roughly reflects that of the entire city?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Richard Daley's administration has announced a strategy to achieve something close to the latter. For this he should be applauded. Instead, he is being lambasted, seemingly from every quarter--though mainly by factions placing their own self-interest above the common good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley has said the next round of promotions to the rank of sergeant will not be based solely on the results of a written test. (The last time that was done, only five minorities placed among the 114 highest-scoring promotees.) Instead, 70 percent of next year's new sergeants will be chosen solely on test results, while another 30 percent will be selected on the basis of job performance. Presumably the latter will be chosen with an eye toward racial and ethnic balance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Police union bosses, apparently content to see a mostly white police force patrol a mostly black and Hispanic city, screamed immediately that Daley wants to bring back old-fashioned political cronyism to the promotion process. That's a cheap shot. It is also, however, fair warning to the mayor that the so-called ""merit"" promotees had better not be sponsored by his pals or by ward committeemen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaders of the African-American Police League, meanwhile, said they were ""insulted"" that the mayor thinks special measures are needed to qualify more black sergeants. They claim the written test--which deals mainly with laws and procedures a sergeant ought to know--is racially biased, even though expert after independent expert has said it is fair. (Perhaps the AAPL is unaware that there have been some problems here with the public schools.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, actual performance would be a welcome criterion even without the racial undertow. No written test can predict how effective an officer will be in defusing an ugly domestic dispute or differentiating at a glance between a drug lookout and somebody waiting for a bus. That requires common sense, compassion and knowledge of the community--none of which are ascertained best by multiple-choice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's uncertain whether Daley's plan will survive the inevitable judicial review. Appellate courts have been leaning against race-based admission and promotion systems, although a wise jurist ought to be able to differentiate between <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> quotas and a diverse city's need to develop an effective police force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Daley's solution isn't perfect. Job performance ought to figure into all promotions, not just 30 percent. And if this more subjective criterion is abused, as some predict, Chicagoans will know whom to blame. For now, the mayor's plan deserves support.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

These 57 census groups simply water down ethnic communities that have gained some degree of political power. Why are Germans who mix with Italians, who mix with Russians, who mix with British all considered ""white"" on the census? These multiethnic Americans of lighter hues have one category from which to choose and constitute one large voting bloc. Meanwhile, multiethnic Americans of darker hues are asked to divvy up 57 ways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, I am African American and have always identified myself as such.

Did the census mean to count that or only count more recent consensual interracial marriages?

5f330bfd7109cd0e649566b6	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2454579785.xml.txt	"<div><p>Trump's claim about doing more for black people makes me sick</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Every time I hear Donald Trump say that he has done more for the Black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, I want to let out a guttural scream.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It took me a while to understand the outrage I felt watching this white man speak to me, an African American, as if he were some sort of savior who has lifted my people from wretchedness and given us a chance to be more like him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though he stops short of saying it, his point is that Black people should be grateful. He is telling us that were he not such an empathetic and benevolent president, African Americans would be far worse off. He suggests that no other president has shown such generosity to a group of people as helpless as we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I now know the cause of my indignation. Trump sounds like a slave master proclaiming that he is good to his Negroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To keep their slaves submissive, the masters would threaten to sell them to less compassionate owners if they got out of line. ""I have done more for the Black community"" sounds like a slave owner claiming that he's a good master because he doesn't beat his slaves as often or cut off their feet to stop them from fleeing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a racist, self-gratifying pronouncement that was passed down through generations of prominent white people who held power over African Americans. It was prevalent in the South during the 1960s, when Black women largely were domestic workers cleaning homes and caring for the children of white employers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was not uncommon for a white woman to brag to her friends about how good she was to her help. Though she paid wages too small to live on, she rewarded her ""girl"" with items from her home -- discarded furniture, clothing and trinkets that Black people struggling to put food on the table would never buy for themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump wants us to understand that even the first Black president, Barack Obama, couldn't fix our problems. Only someone like him -- white with an abundance of intellect -- could lead us to the Promised Land. But there's only so much he can do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's comments reflect the racist, stereotypical attitude he and others in his circle espouse about the Black community. He sees African Americans as violently barbaric people and describes our neighborhoods as ""living in hell.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has written us off as too dumb to understand how we have created these conditions ourselves. And he is losing patience with us because we refuse to acknowledge all that he does for us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, expressed it more bluntly. Appearing Monday on ""Fox & Friends,"" Kushner brought up the old racist adage that Black people can't succeed to the heights of white people because they don't want to be successful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""One thing we've seen in a lot of the Black community, which is mostly Democrat, is that President Trump's policies are the policies that can help people break out of the problems that they're complaining about,"" said Kushner, a top White House adviser. ""But he can't want them to be successful more than they want to be successful.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kushner went on to suggest that African Americans would rather complain than do what is necessary to improve their lives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, the white savior in the Oval Office has broken his back trying to help Black people, while we are being lazy and shiftless. This came from someone who came up in his father's business and is only in his prominent position because he is married to the president's daughter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The hypocrisy of both Kushner and Trump, who inherited wealth from his father, is astounding. It shows complete ignorance when it comes to the interplay between race and economics in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It overlooks the impressive achievements of large numbers of African Americans in spite of a system that historically has offered little or no assistance. It also ignores that this same system has successfully fought to tear down equalizers such as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> that sought to provide a bridge to economic parity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Speaking at Stanford University in 2017, Harvard University sociologist William Julius Wilson pointed out that the income of more affluent African Americans was increasing prior to Trump taking office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When adjusted for inflation, the percentage of African Americans earning at least $75,000 more than doubled to 21% from 1970 to 2014, he said. Those making $100,000 or more nearly quadrupled to 13%. In contrast, white Americans saw a less impressive increase, from 11 to 26%, he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By no means does that indicate that African Americans have reached economic parity in this county. In fact, we remain far from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it does prove that Trump is not the savior to Black people he claims to be. More so, it shows that African Americans can do, and always have done, a lot better without him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>dglanton@chicagotribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter @dahleeng</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CREDIT: Dahleen Glanton</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports	
5f330bfd7109cd0e649566b6	aa_opeds_sample/txt/432415722.xml.txt	"<div><p>Fixing the Race Gap in 25 Years or Less</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE Supreme Court decision upholding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in university admissions seemed to carry an expiration date. ''We expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her 5-to-4 majority opinion last week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the justices have in the past said that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> should not be used forever, never before has a justice placed a specific time limit on it. Having now done so, Justice O'Connor has raised tough questions, both broad and specific.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are her views merely idle musings, or will they become an iron-clad legal principle? Should the goal be parity in graduation rates of white, black and Hispanic high school students? Or should it be equality in financing between poor school districts, which tend to have more minority students, and middle-class white ones? Can the gap between black and white students on the SAT be bridged in the next generation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In The Chicago Tribune, Justice O'Connor said in a rare interview that the country can tackle many of these challenges. ''I hope it looks as though we don't need artificial help to fill our classrooms with highly qualified students at the graduate level,'' she said. ''And if we do our job on educating young people, we can reach that goal.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But closing the disparities in educational achievement and opportunities for college applicants across racial and ethnic lines will involve vociferous debate over the relative importance of school financing, social inequality and student study habits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Statistics tell the story. On every major indicator of academic success -- the SAT, the A.C.T. and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (given to elementary and secondary students) -- the gap between white and minority students has persisted for decades. Though it narrowed somewhat on the national assessment exams from the 1980's through the early 90's, the divide has only widened since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''There is some serious heavy lifting to do before we get to the dream scenario Justice O'Connor is envisioning,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and an assistant secretary of education in the Reagan administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some liberals say the gap can be closed only by equalizing the amount of money spent on educating whites and minorities. The school districts that many blacks and Hispanics attend spend $902 less per student on average than mostly white districts, according to a national study conducted last year by the Education Trust, a group focused on closing the achievement gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some degree, federal and state governments can, and do, try to fix this imbalance by sending more money to schools serving poor -- and, by extension, disproportionately minority -- students. Federal assistance for poor students is increasing, and state governments gave an average of $27 more per pupil to disproportionately minority schools in 2000 than to predominately white schools, though that hardly had a perceptible impact on the financing gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if federal and state lawmakers were bent on eliminating the financial discrepancies between white and minority districts, they couldn't have much affect. On average, states and the federal government have never accounted for more than 56 percent of schools' revenues over the last decade or so; the remainder has come from local sources, mostly property taxes. This financial structure makes parity unlikely at best.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And conservatives argue that the focus on financial parity misses the point, and point to some minority-dominated city school districts that have high spending per student but still lag well behind less flush districts, particularly in rural areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, educational parity may be linked to bigger, more complex economic factors. Most beneficiaries of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> are middle-income. According to a study by Anthony Carnevale, vice president of the Educational Testing Service, 74 percent of students at the 146 most prestigious colleges and universities -- where competition for admissions is most intense and where <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is practiced -- come from families in the top 25 percent of the nation's socioeconomic scale (as measured by income, educational attainment and occupations of the parents). Only 3 percent of the students at these highly selective schools come from the bottom 25 percent of the socioeconomic scale. As Lani Guinier, a law professor at Harvard University, puts it, ''<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is less an escalator up than it is a bridge across.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even middle-class black and Hispanic children who are burdened with issues of crime, troubled homes and poor schools have not been able to close the test-score gap with their white counterparts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The gap persists across all income levels,'' said Freeman Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, who has written extensively on improving the academic achievement of black students. ''We're talking about generations of habits in too many homes,'' said Mr. Hrabowski, who is black. ''Unfortunately, reading is not the No. 1 priority as a habit. There is much more emphasis on television watching.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both sides on the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> issue agree on the need to close the education gap, but not much else. Some supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hope that Justice O'Connor's 25-year time frame will protect <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> while the country makes headway in closing that rift.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the decision last week does not invalidate laws in California and Washington State that ban the use of race in public university admissions, hiring and government contracting. Ward Connerly, the black California businessman who was the force behind passing those laws, has already vowed to make Michigan his next target.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demographic pressures will also come into play. The Educational Testing Service estimates that from 1995 to 2015, the percentage of whites on college campuses will decline from 71 percent to 63 percent, while Hispanics will increase to 15 percent, from the current 11 percent, with blacks holding steady at 13 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with minorities making up a larger proportion of students going to college -- and with the children of young immigrants approaching college age toward the end of Justice O'Connor's 25-year target -- Hispanic and black parents may be clamoring even more forcefully that their children not be shut out of top schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the debate has not changed. Opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> will continue to say that such programs keep the country from focusing on what needs to be done -- namely, helping minority students meet higher standards. The supporters of race preferences counter that the country cannot end <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> without first fixing the education system. All agree that unless a commitment is made -- by society and minority families themselves -- the old arguments will still be around in 25 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lisa Navarette, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said, ''If all we do over the 25 years is <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, then we will still need <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, 1964: The University of Michigan Law School yearbook reflects the times.

Gavin Newsom, we have said that California’s values are at stake as well. The leading Republican candidates, particularly front-runner Larry Elder, don’t support the values most Californians hold dear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And what are those values? There’s no official definition cast in bronze at the state Capitol in Sacramento. Values are ideas that live separately in the minds of everyone, but collectively they form a culture that embraces multiple people, communities and generations. They are given actual form in policies and goals that build a more welcoming, tolerant, prosperous, healthy and equitable state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And they are in danger. Here’s how:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Protection of natural resources</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California could be just another uninspiring patch of dirt were it not for its stunning geography: sunny beaches, towering mountain ranges, gentle rolling hills, rugged coastlines, soaring forests, fertile inland valleys and breathtaking deserts. Most of the Golden State’s history is a tale of exploitation of this seemingly endless abundance. Gold! Timber! Open land!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only in the last half a century have California’s leaders started to rein in the predation by protecting the state’s natural resources and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet many of the leading Republican recall candidates seem to have no interest in maintaining the climate or environmental goals supported by this governor and are more inclined to seek policies that would make things worse — much worse. Several candidates have said, for example, they would seek expanded oil drilling and fracking operations, encourage more logging of forests and suspend environmental rules wholesale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are already losing much of the beauty of California and its flora and fauna to the poor choices made by decades of short-sighted leadership. If we lose much more, it may not be worth saving.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, tolerance and equality</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From its early days, California has represented a meeting and mixing of peoples, a destination for risk-takers and refugees, entrepreneurs and escapees. But it hasn’t been a bastion of tolerance and equality for most of its existence, as evidenced by the displacement of Indigenous communities, the embrace of the racist Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and ballot-box assaults on immigrant rights in 1994, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in 1996 and same-sex marriage in 2008. But over the last decade, California has evolved into a beacon of tolerance and equality that inspires the rest of the nation and, indeed, freedom-loving peoples everywhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the policies sometimes swing too far, such as when the Legislature banned travel by California state employees to states that passed anti-LGBTQ laws or when the governor bent over backward to ensure equity in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and ended up only temporarily delaying the rollout? ? Perhaps, but those are rare examples.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The efforts the state has taken under Newsom’s leadership to reverse discriminatory polices and ensure equal access — such as reforming a criminal justice system that disproportionately affects people of color and supporting the creation of a panel to examine reparations to Californians descended from enslaved people — are at risk. We fear the state’s position as a fighter against intolerance will end if Newsom is recalled, as many of the leading Republican recall candidates deny that racial discrimination and inequality even exist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Embracing democracy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Republican legislatures and governors in other U.S. states have passed laws to make it harder for citizens to vote, California has gone about as far any state to expand access to the franchise. (Colorado, which pioneered many of the voting reforms California adopted, is another.) It did this by adopting automatic registration through the Department of Motor Vehicles, same-day registration, early vote centers and generous grace periods for late ballots.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it is the misuse of the state’s generous support of citizen engagement — its direct democracy system that allows the citizens to make and repeal laws, and to remove elected officials — that has led to this threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least one of the recall candidates, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), told the Los Angeles Times editorial board he supports voter ID, which is one of the main ways that Republicans in other states have sought to suppress voting among communities of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Support for the marginalized</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California is an extravagantly wealthy state. But it’s also a land of searing inequality and entrenched poverty. Homeless encampments and shantytowns should be an eternal source of shame. Caring for the state’s inhabitants in need, regardless of their economic situation or immigration status, is one of the most fundamental of California values.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What this means in practical terms is an expansion of the safety net such as the state has done, including providing relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring sick pay for workers and pouring billions of the state’s budget surplus into programs that help and house the unsheltered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This also means continuing to reverse decades of counterproductive criminal justice efforts that have resulted in excessive sentences and crippling, unnecessary costs — on taxpayers, on communities struggling to recover from crime and on offenders who have learned their lesson and want to live responsible lives but remain stuck in prison.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom understands this. But if he is removed, would his successor? Probably not. Most of the recall candidates think the criminal justice reforms should be stopped.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do we know these are values shared by Californians? Simple. These changes did not happen organically; they were shepherded by elected officials, such as Newsom, who were supported by a majority of Californians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, what’s on the recall ballot is the most important value of all: democracy.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes
5f330bfd7109cd0e649566b6	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2414754878.xml.txt	"<div><p>Roberts to Trump: Don’t Take the Supreme Court for Granted</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A week of decisions contained hidden and not-so-hidden messages from the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suppose there had been a leak from the Supreme Court early Thursday morning: The court was about to issue its long-awaited decision in the DACA case on the fate of nearly 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers; the vote was 5 to 4; and the majority opinion was by Chief Justice John Roberts. But the leaker didn’t know, or wouldn’t say, which way the case came out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Dreamers and their supporters, hearts would have been in their throats. This was the chief justice, after all, who two years ago wrote the opinion upholding President Trump’s Muslim travel ban, and who five years before that wrote the opinion dismantling the Voting Rights Act. The vote in both was 5 to 4. Why wouldn’t the conservative chief justice defer to the president’s decision to end a program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that his predecessor had instituted by executive action without even seeking Congress’s approval?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president’s allies would have had ample reason to be anxious. Wasn’t this the chief justice who just a year ago wrote the majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 blocked the president’s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census? The proposal failed the essential requirement of administrative law for “reasoned decision making,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote in that case. He dismissed the administration’s proffered good-government rationale as pretextual; or, as the dictionary puts it, “dubious or spurious.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, of course, we know that it was the Chief Justice Roberts of the census decision, which an enraged President Trump came within inches of defying, who arrived on the scene in time to save the Dreamers. His opinion assured readers that in holding that the administration’s effort to undo DACA was invalid, the court was not endorsing the program. That is conventional administrative law talk — and the case, as the chief justice framed it, was a conventional one about administrative procedure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration’s explanation for why it was terminating DACA — explained in a single sentence by an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (“Taking into consideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated”) — was so inadequate as to make the decision “arbitrary and capricious,” Chief Justice Roberts said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the department came up with a more elaborate explanation nine months later in response to an unfavorable Federal District Court ruling, the chief justice said that it was a “foundational principle of administrative law” that an agency, once challenged, has to defend its action on the grounds it initially invoked, not on an after-the-fact rationalization, unless it wants to restart from scratch the process of arriving at a decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dry procedural language of the opinion, including its invitation to the Trump administration to start over and find a new way to defend terminating DACA, seems to have lulled many readers into assuming that the victory for the Dreamers is less than complete. No doubt many eyes had glazed over by Page 24, when the chief justice began a crucial discussion of the “reliance interests” in favor of continuing the program that permits DACA recipients to live and work lawfully in the only country that most of them have ever known.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Citing statistics in briefs filed by, among others, a group of 143 businesses, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that those with a stake in continuing the program included not only the Dreamers themselves but also their families, “including their 200,000 U.S.-citizen children,” “employers who have invested time and money in training them” and state and local governments that would lose tax revenue from DACA recipients’ earnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Administrative law requires the agency to take reliance interests into account, Chief Justice Roberts said. “DHS may determine, in the particular context before it, that other interests and policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests,” he said, adding, “Making that difficult decision was the agency’s job, but the agency failed to do it.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And can the Trump administration do it now? Theoretically yes, under still another acting homeland security secretary, but any newly justified rescission announcement would find the administration back in court within hours, the clock ticking all the while toward Election Day. Although the chief justice nominally left it up to the administration to weigh the reliance interests against its policy goal, his exposition of the strength of those interests sets a very high bar for this or any subsequent administration to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where was the other Chief Justice Roberts this week, the one of the disastrous Shelby County v. Holder voting rights decision and of the travel ban decision? Was the Chief Justice Roberts who silently joined Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion bringing L.G.B.T.Q. people within the protection of federal anti-discrimination law the same chief justice who wrote a snarky dissenting opinion five years ago when the court upheld the constitutional right to same-sex marriage?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contemplating this head-snapping week at the Supreme Court, I’m reminded of the amazing 2002-2003 term, when the court under another conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist, seemed to pull its robust conservatism up short. In the space of a few weeks in the spring of 2003, the court upheld <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in higher education; granted constitutional protection to gay men and lesbians for their private sexual lives; and upheld the application of the family-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act to state employees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Rehnquist himself was in dissent in the first two of those cases, but he surprised nearly everyone by writing the majority opinion in the third, a case that may sound obscure now but that effectively spelled an end to the federalism revolution on which, under the chief justice’s leadership, the court had been embarked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could have accounted for that surprising turn of events at the dawn of the new century? Wrestling with that question, I eventually concluded that the court was realigning itself, as it has done historically, with its own sense of what the public wanted and expected from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“No great Supreme Court case is only a question of law,” I wrote then. “It is always also an episode in the ongoing dialogue by which the court engages with the society in which it operates and in which the justices live.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just so with this week’s cases. Monday’s ruling on the right of gay and transgender people to be free of discrimination in the workplace showed a court that by a refreshing vote of 6 to 3 decided not to stand in the path of a tide of social change. The DACA decision contained a message threaded through its dry language of administrative procedure — a warning to the Trump administration not to assume that it gets a free pass, not to take the Supreme Court for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“This is not the case for cutting corners,” the chief justice wrote. That’s a sentence sure to be echoing in the halls of the solicitor general’s office, where Chief Justice Roberts once worked and where he honed his ability to speak to the Supreme Court. Now, with four colleagues to his left and four to his right, he speaks for the court from a center chair that must often feel like a lonely place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the decisions due in the next few weeks on abortion, religion, the president’s tax returns and the Electoral College, among other cases, it’s too soon to place a label on this pandemic-disrupted Supreme Court term. The justices will issue decisions that will infuriate, reassure, surprise and even break hearts, as they evidently broke Senator Josh Hawley’s on Monday. The Missouri Republican took to the Senate floor to bemoan “the end of the conservative legal movement.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as the ambitious young senator, a former law clerk to Chief Justice Roberts, surely knows, there is no end, only a new beginning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

They then invoked an obscure Senate rule that required the judicial candidates to be re-nominated. (Yes, these are the same Republicans who used to loudly demand that every one of President George W. Bush's nominees get a vote on the Senate floor, regardless of their qualifications.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most prominent of the five repeaters is Goodwin Liu, a law professor and legal scholar who would be the only Asian-American serving as an active judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Liu went to Stanford, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and graduated from Yale Law School. He clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before beginning a teaching career at the University of California, Berkeley,  School of Law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, it is largely his stellar background that is fueling Republican opposition. Mr. Liu, who is 39, is seen as a strong possibility to be on President Obama's short list for a future Supreme Court vacancy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives do not like Mr. Liu's support for same-sex marriage rights, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and his view that the Constitution is a living document that evolves over time. But his views fall well within the legal and political mainstream. His warnings that Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel Alito would turn out to be extremely conservative were accurate. But Mr. Liu is no rigid liberal ideologue, as his support of school vouchers and charter schools attest. Kenneth Starr, the conservative lawyer who investigated President Bill Clinton, co-signed a letter vouching for Mr. Liu's ""independence and openness to diverse viewpoints.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be nice if some Republican members of the Judiciary Committee voted for Mr. Liu and the four other re-nominees (along with three other new nominees). Whether they do or not, the White House and Senate Democrats should persist in fighting for their confirmation and the confirmation of the 16 other pending nominees already approved by the committee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the comparable point in the Bush presidency, the Senate had confirmed 61.4 percent of Mr. Bush's nominees. For Mr. Obama, it's under 50 percent. His nominees are no radicals. That description applies to Republicans holding up well-qualified choices like Mr. Liu.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

It may seem counterintuitive to suggest that the Caucus should support the passage of legislation that targets the rich for a tax reduction. But a meaningful capital gains tax cut will help those of us in the black community who are helping to create jobs for middle- and working-class people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Passage of a capital gains tax cut will stimulate economic growth by freeing up capital for new investments, including venture capital investments in black-controlled companies, thereby creating jobs for the constituents of CBC members. In the long run, policies that increase the availability of investment capital for entrepreneurial endeavors could completely eliminate the need for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Venture capital, which would receive a big boost from a capital gains tax cut, is a proven method of creating jobs. The most recent study by Venture One Corporation and the National Venture Capital Association found that 495 venture-capital-backed companies generated 75,240 new U.S. jobs between 1989 and 1993. It also found $2 billion of export sales were generated by the same companies. The CBC needs to become a more active and vocal advocate of the black business community in general and the flow of investment capital to black business in particular. As welfare reform increases the pressure on disadvantaged blacks in the inner cities of America, policies that stimulate black business growth are needed to provide opportunities for those coming off the welfare rolls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the moment, the private equity business, with more than $170 billion under management as of year-end 1994 (according to Private Equity Analyst estimates), flourishes with capital contributions from public pensions funds, corporate pension plans, banks and insurance companies. But very little of that capital has been directed to black firms. It is a national problem that deserves national attention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond simply cutting capital gains taxes, there are other measures the government can take to help black-owned busineses. Two initiatives come to mind, both of which can be initiated by the administration without additional legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, since the Labor Department regulates pension funds and has the responsibility to issue interpretations of regulations, Secretary Robert Reich could issue interpretations of current pension fund policies to encourage them to invest in black-owned businesses. The second initiative should be aimed at getting the brokerage industry to raise money for the black companies. With approximately $1 trillion raised each year by the U.S. brokerage industry for American businesses, it would be good business for the major brokerage firms to tap the capital markets on behalf of black businesses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But none of this is a substitute for a capital gains tax cut. The effect on black-controlled businesses would be to greatly increase the flow of venture capital in the form of equity to such businesses. This decade has seen for the first time genuine interest being expressed by the institutional investment community in making venture capital investments in black businesses. Substantially all black-controlled companies are privately held, and are precisely the type of firms that would benefit from an increased infusion of venture capital from institutions and wealthy individuals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A good indication of the impact that such investments can have on black employment lies in a 1993 Wall Street Journal survey, which found that 60% of all black businesses employ a work force at least 70% black. With a badly needed infusion of equity capital to allow them to expand, black firms would create more jobs for the substantially black constituency base of CBC members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are other benefits for the CBC in a capital gains tax cut. It would enable the lawmakers to replace the narrowly targeted broadcast properties tax incentive recently struck down by the Republican majority in Congress with a tax incentive that would benefit all industries in which black businesses operate. It would also enable the CBC to form a unique alliance with the Republican Congress to enact legislation that will help all Americans, including black Americans. Such an alliance would position the CBC as a dynamic voting bloc and its members as leaders able to deliver for their constituents by skillfully adapting to the changing political environment. This would most certainly increase the value of the CBC vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Granger is president of Ark Capital Management in Chicago.

One whose ranks and command structure are dominated by non-Hispanic whites? Or one whose makeup roughly reflects that of the entire city?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Richard Daley's administration has announced a strategy to achieve something close to the latter. For this he should be applauded. Instead, he is being lambasted, seemingly from every quarter--though mainly by factions placing their own self-interest above the common good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley has said the next round of promotions to the rank of sergeant will not be based solely on the results of a written test. (The last time that was done, only five minorities placed among the 114 highest-scoring promotees.) Instead, 70 percent of next year's new sergeants will be chosen solely on test results, while another 30 percent will be selected on the basis of job performance. Presumably the latter will be chosen with an eye toward racial and ethnic balance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Police union bosses, apparently content to see a mostly white police force patrol a mostly black and Hispanic city, screamed immediately that Daley wants to bring back old-fashioned political cronyism to the promotion process. That's a cheap shot. It is also, however, fair warning to the mayor that the so-called ""merit"" promotees had better not be sponsored by his pals or by ward committeemen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaders of the African-American Police League, meanwhile, said they were ""insulted"" that the mayor thinks special measures are needed to qualify more black sergeants. They claim the written test--which deals mainly with laws and procedures a sergeant ought to know--is racially biased, even though expert after independent expert has said it is fair. (Perhaps the AAPL is unaware that there have been some problems here with the public schools.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, actual performance would be a welcome criterion even without the racial undertow. No written test can predict how effective an officer will be in defusing an ugly domestic dispute or differentiating at a glance between a drug lookout and somebody waiting for a bus. That requires common sense, compassion and knowledge of the community--none of which are ascertained best by multiple-choice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's uncertain whether Daley's plan will survive the inevitable judicial review. Appellate courts have been leaning against race-based admission and promotion systems, although a wise jurist ought to be able to differentiate between <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> quotas and a diverse city's need to develop an effective police force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Daley's solution isn't perfect. Job performance ought to figure into all promotions, not just 30 percent. And if this more subjective criterion is abused, as some predict, Chicagoans will know whom to blame. For now, the mayor's plan deserves support.</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

These 57 census groups simply water down ethnic communities that have gained some degree of political power. Why are Germans who mix with Italians, who mix with Russians, who mix with British all considered ""white"" on the census? These multiethnic Americans of lighter hues have one category from which to choose and constitute one large voting bloc. Meanwhile, multiethnic Americans of darker hues are asked to divvy up 57 ways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, I am African American and have always identified myself as such.

Did the census mean to count that or only count more recent consensual interracial marriages? Do ""blacks"" have to have a close white relative, be raised by one, or simply embrace everyone who has contributed to their genetic makeup in order to qualify for the ""white-black"" box?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of clarity on this question makes the data collected invalid for the purpose of drawing conclusions.

In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back.

The bill will “bring needed transparency to the abusive spying programs that have tarnished the nation’s reputation.” Introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the measure would require the government “to disclose how many people’s data was collected by intelligence agencies, and how many of those people were American.” Perhaps most important, the bill will “create a panel of advocates to argue before the court in support of privacy rights and civil liberties, and would require the court to issue public summaries of its decisions that specifically detail the impact on those rights.” It “represents a breakthrough in the struggle against the growth of government surveillance power.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other significant viewpoints from around the world:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An editorial in The Washington Post supports a decision handed down by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the University of Texas at Austin’s <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> admissions policies. “This was not much of a surprise,” The Post writes. “The 5th Circuit sided with the university last time it examined the case.” Nevertheless, it’s an important move: The Post cites it as “a prime example of the sort that should survive judicial scrutiny.” Texas’s “top 10 percent program” guarantees admission for students in the top 10 percent of every public high-school graduating class, but the U.T. Austin “fills the rest of its classes with students who get in under a comprehensive, holistic review of their academic and personal records.” When the case returns to the Supreme Court, the justices should affirm that U.T.’s “conscientiously designed” program, a cautious effort to complement the race-neutral top 10 percent program and seek diversity, is permissible.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Massachusetts State Legislature “took a big step toward addressing the U.S. Supreme Court’s objections to the state’s ‘buffer-zone’ law,” according to an editorial in The Boston Globe. The buffer-zone law prohibited protesting within 35 feet of the entrance to abortion clinics — it was “deemed by the court to be overly broad, restricting the free speech of the plaintiffs, who sought to dissuade women from having abortions by quietly handing them literature and urging them to consider alternatives.” This new law would permit law-enforcement officers to order protesters to withdraw from an abbreviated buffer zone “if they impede access to the clinic.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“For the past five months, the world’s most important unelected official has been a 67-year-old former economics professor, who’s apparently still pre-gentrified Brooklyn enough to pronounce guide ‘goyd,’” says an editorial in The Guardian. Since Janet Yellen’s appointment to chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, she has “displayed the greatest acuity about what rate-setters must do: ‘The low rate of wage growth is, to me, another sign that the Fed’s job is not yet done.’ Bingo!” The difference between Ms. Yellen and her British counterpart, Mark J. Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is that “while Mr. Carney has his sights set on unemployment, Ms. Yellen doesn’t just want Americans off the dole — she wants to get them a pay rise too.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“The massive, worldwide die-off of honeybees has been one of the biggest environmental scares of this new century,” says an editorial in The Globe and Mail. “The possible extinction of the planet’s most prolific pollinator is more than a bit terrifying.” But “colony collapse disorder, while a real threat, is being remarkably well managed.” Governments, scientists and beekeepers “have been making steady progress against it” — the European Union has imposed a two-year ban on three types of pesticide especially harmful to bees to measure whether their absence improves bee-colony health. Meanwhile, the Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists “has done and excellent job of monitoring wintering losses since colony collapse disorder first came to light,” and their annual reports since show a slowly declining average mortality rate during winter months. “There is more work and research to be done, but the outlook is hopeful.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“Last week, the U.N. Committee on Human Rights called on Japan to ensure that effective, independent and impartial investigations be launched into wartime sex slavery and to offer an apologia to ‘comfort women,’ who were forced to work in its military brothels,” according to an editorial in The Korea Herald. Tokyo rejected the committee’s request. “While expressing regrets about the recommendation, the Abe government denied again that Korean and other Asian women were coerced into military sex slavery.” This historical revisionism is “angering Korea and other victimized Asian countries,” The Herald writes, and if Japan wishes to maintain “harmonious, friendly relations” with Korea, Mr. Abe’s government must come to terms with its colonial history.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Rehnquist has cancer is how much information the court owes the public about the chief justice's health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only facts revealed -- that Rehnquist has one of several forms of thyroid cancer and that he received a tracheotomy at Bethesda Naval Hospital before being discharged Friday -- were enough to fuel speculation by medical experts about the 80-year- old's condition but not to settle the most pressing questions about the future of the chief justice, and of the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court's terseness is consistent with its long tradition of discretion concerning justices' personal lives. With few exceptions - - in 1975, after a crippling stroke, Justice William O. Douglas held a news conference -- health information about the life-tenured members of the court is especially closely guarded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tradition was born in the days before the court played a central role in policymaking. But now, when the court has a role in everything from whether race can be considered in college admissions to the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, some are saying that tradition has to change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If the chief justice's medical prognosis is indeed such that he may not be able to finish this term, that's something the American people have a right to know, especially where you have dueling doctors speculating about the meaning of a tracheotomy,"" said David J. Garrow, a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at Emory University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If it were [Speaker of the House] Dennis Hastert or [Senate Minority Leader] Tom Daschle, people would say there is an unchallengeable public right to know as much as the public official himself knows,"" Garrow said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others defended the court's approach. They noted the constitutional differences between the judiciary and the other branches of government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The court operates according to a different rule,"" said Michael A. Carvin, a former Reagan administration Justice Department official. ""There is no constitutional transition issue like you have with the president. There is no day-to-day, commander-in-chief-type responsibility. You can operate the court on autopilot. You can't operate the presidency that way.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also is possible that not even the chief justice is certain about his condition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""In my opinion, he owes the public whatever he gives the public,"" said Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper, a former Rehnquist law clerk. ""He may still be finding things out himself.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SWINGER: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role on the court, long a matter of conventional wisdom among lawyers, has been confirmed by the latest quantitative methods of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a forthcoming North Carolina Law Review article, professors Andrew D. Martin, Kevin Quinn and Lee Epstein show not only that O'Connor is the court's ""median voter,"" but also that the 74-year- old has moved steadily to the left in recent years, taking the court with her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of math is involved, but basically the professors ranked justices on a numerical scale, assigning point values to their ideological leanings as shown through their votes. The higher the number, the more conservative the voting record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2002, the last term covered by the study, Justice Clarence Thomas was the most conservative, with a score of 3.637; Justice John Paul Stevens, at -2.516, was the most liberal. O'Connor's score, 0.247, just a hair to the right of center, represented the court's midpoint. O'Connor's score has gone down steadily, or become more liberal, since 1994. In that year, she was at 0.637.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study also argues that, but for O'Connor's evolution, the court would not have approved of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, which it did in 2003, by a 5 to 4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to their calculations, the political scientists say, ""the likelihood of O'Connor providing the key vote to uphold the program was quite small for any term prior to 2001.""</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

But Obama is a Democrat, beloved by the glassy-eyed media as a symbol of hope and change, even if guys from Chicago's City Hall run his administration. So the gaffe will  soon wash over him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it's that other screw-up that is most illuminating -- the one that was overshadowed by his unfortunate Special Olympics wisecrack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama told Jay Leno he was surprised that those greedy AIG executives who helped lead the country into financial ruin were in line to receive $165 million in bonuses paid for by bailout cash authorized by his administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Stunned, stunned is the word,"" said Obama.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that his Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- who didn't pay all of his federal taxes but was still deemed worthy by Obama of collecting yours -- knew all about the AIG bonuses weeks ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was long before Washington Democrats began shrieking in pretend outrage over the bonuses, as if they didn't vote for them, sort of like Chicago aldermen shrieking about corruption from the 5th Floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's like Mayor Richard Daley saying, ""Gee, I dunno"" when news breaks that his nephews are in another multimillion-dollar government deal. Or that time that Daley gave $100 million in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> contracts to men he knows well, yet was stunned to learn later that they were white guys, not black females.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These days, the Washington Way is looking just like the Chicago Way. Those of us from Illinois can see it, what with City Hall guys pulling White House strings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then again, we're not surprised because we don't get the high-grade Hopium out here in the Midwest. The good stuff must be reserved for the Beltway media establishment, since they're the ones feeling  tingles running up their legs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet even they'll figure out that the Chicago Way runs along Pennsylvania Avenue, once the Hopium wears off and the tingling stops. It'll probably take about eight years for their heads to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the meantime, all last week, the ludicrous Angry-Democrat-vs.-Greedy-AIG slapstick was highly entertaining, except when you realize the premise of the joke is that American taxpayers are so stupid we'll believe anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she'd tax those arrogant AIG guys and take the money back. This is the same Pelosi who is extremely wealthy, worth millions,  yet she jets coast to coast on weekends on your dime, because she's the speaker. Why doesn't she buy her own jet and have the unemployed AIG guys serve drinks to the real estate lobbyists?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At her news conference Thursday, Pelosi became so upset over AIG questions that she cut off reporters by saying, ""New subject, or else,"" and naturally, being under the influence of primo Hopium, they changed the subject.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But all this false congressional outrage and shrieking and fingerpointing should be understood for what it really is: Political buttocks-covering by Democrats who are worried about the 2010 elections, and afraid of losing their greatest symbolic weapon: The Evil Rich Guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's another cartoon, like Mr. Burns on ""The Simpsons,"" who steps on the backs of the humble working man. Now, though, the Democrats aren't fighting Mr. Burns, they're giving him a boost so he can step on our necks with a pair of snazzy AIG loafers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What they're trying to drown out with all their screaming is that the Democrats knew all about the $165 million to the AIG suits. And the Obama White House knew all about it too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, it was a rather brave New York Democrat, Rep. Joseph Crowley, who asked Geithner about the AIG bonuses in a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee. Not yesterday, or a couple days ago, but on March 3.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Just last month,"" Crowley told Geithner, ""AIG paid 343 employees of AIG FP -- their Financial Products division that created the financial hole that AIG is in, and in turn a multibillion-dollar bill for American taxpayers -- $56 million in bonuses and are slated to pay an additional $162 million in bonuses to 393 participants in the coming weeks,"" Crowley said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""And there's more,"" Crowley said. ""Further bonus payments totaling approximately $230 million are due to 407 participants at AIG's Financial Products division in March 2010. This makes no sense to my constituency.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it makes perfect sense back here, where we get only that  weak schwag Hopium. They cut the deal in some back room, and Geithner is being measured as the fall guy. It sounds just like Chicago's City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm stunned, really.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned is the word.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: Photo: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who testified on Capitol Hill this month, knew all about the millions in bonuses for American International Group Inc. executives weeks ago.

And they never seem to end.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Paris protesters are getting all the attention, but France isn't the only country where angry masses are taking to the streets to be heard.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Journal reported Monday that an estimated 55,000 people gathered in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur last weekend to defend race-based policies that give preferential treatment to the majority Muslim Malay population. Defenders argue that ending racial preferences would ""dilute decades of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies introduced to help Malays catch up with the generally wealthier ethnic Chinese,"" who comprise less than a quarter of the population.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> in Malaysia began in the 1950s, after the British colonial administrators, who had welcomed laborers from China, departed. Since 1971, Malays have enjoyed preferential treatment over their Chinese compatriots in everything from schooling and housing to government jobs and access to capital. The government's express goal was ""racial balance,"" and to that end Malay entrepreneurs were given preference in obtaining credit, licenses and government contracts. Developers offer Malays discounts on new homes, and shopping centers have even banned ethnic-Chinese-owned businesses to limit competition with Malay proprietors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These policies were supposed to sunset in 1991, but the country's leaders have repeatedly extended them in exchange for political support. ""Schemes favouring Malays were once deemed essential to improve the lot of Malaysia's least wealthy racial group,"" explains the Economist magazine, but ""these days they are widely thought to help mostly the well-off within that group, while failing the poor and aggravating ethnic tensions.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To anyone who has followed the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> debate in the U.S., a lot of this probably sounds familiar. Like their Malay counterparts, American proponents of racial double standards say they are necessary to help the underprivileged, even though the beneficiaries tend to be people who were already well-off to begin with. Liberal politicians defend color-conscious policies to win votes, and courts assure us the policies will not exist in perpetuity. ""We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,"" wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in a 2003 Supreme Court decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it has in Malaysia, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> continues to stoke racial and ethnic tensions in the U.S., especially in education. Harvard is being sued for discrimination against Asian applicants. The plaintiffs say Asians are held to higher standards than other applicants to limit their numbers on campus. Harvard insists that more Asians aren't admitted because they aren't as multidimensional as their non-Asian peers, an argument eerily similar to the one Ivy League schools once used to discriminate against Jews.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has angered the parents of white and Asian students by pushing for racial quotas at the city's top public high schools. Some 80% of black and Hispanic students in New York City's traditional public schools perform below grade level in reading and math. Is it really any wonder that black and Hispanic students are underrepresented at elite schools that use an admission test? Unfortunately, the mayor and his supporters would rather scrap the test than focus on doing a better job of preparing kids to take it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the debate domestically often centers on the legality of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and whether it's permitted under our constitution, a more practical concern is whether these policies actually work as intended--here in America or in other countries where they've been implemented. Malaysia's racial preferences have been in place for more than 50 years, and the Malays still haven't caught up to the ethnic Chinese, who outperform them in school and in the workforce. The gap has narrowed over the past half-century, but it remains significant, and attributing Malay progress to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is dubious. For one thing, Malays in neighboring Singapore, which has no <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and where they are a minority, are better off economically than the Malays in Malaysia, who receive favorable treatment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs in the U.S. are regularly given undeserved credit for expanding the size of the black middle class. The reality is that the most dramatic declines in black poverty preceded <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs, which began in earnest in the 1970s. Black incomes doubled in the 1960s--before <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. And blacks were entering middle-class professions at a much faster clip in the decades preceding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than they did in the decades following its implementation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the University of California system ended race-based admissions in 1996, more blacks enrolled and a higher percentage of them not only graduated but obtained degrees in the more challenging fields of engineering and science. Policies intended to help sometimes do the opposite, whether they are implemented in the U.S. or halfway around the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Jason L.

Pete Wilson turns 85 tomorrow, so on behalf of all Californians, I say: gracias. (That's ""thank you"" in Spanish, Pedro.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for your 30-plus years of service as a public official -- first, as an assemblyman for San Diego, then as the mayor of that city, followed by two terms apiece as our U.S. senator and governor. Your career helped shaped the modern-day Golden State.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a career mostly defined by a moderate approach -- an important lesson for the Democrats and Republicans of today that too few bother to remember.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a mayoral career that saw you protect San Diego's wetlands and implement <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> hiring practices. ""He believes that America's minorities have been handicapped for years,"" one campaign flier read, ""by inadequate housing, education and job opportunities, and he has dedicated his efforts to alleviating these problems."" That's a reality that more Republicans should acknowledge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for being so hurt when the Republican Party pulled their 1972 convention from San Diego that you responded with an ""America's Finest City"" campaign. You showed second-tier cities across the country that they too should be proud of who they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for proving that Republicans can take the lead in addressing America's prior racial wrongs. As senator, you cosponsored the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which granted reparations and an official government apology to Japanese Americans interned during World War II.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for showing us that a Republican governor could understand that raising taxes to help shore up public finances was a wise thing and not treason. In 1991, when California faced a record deficit, you backed tax increases for sales, the wealthy and even snacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias too for throwing away this record of centrism. (Just bear with me.) You showed future generations of politicians how not to ruin their legacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for helping to deregulate California's electricity, which led to mass blackouts in the beginning of the 2000s and convinced an entire generation that we shouldn't leave public utilities to the private market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for signing the state's three-strikes sentencing laws. The increase in prisoners proved that justice isn't blind but usually racist and always classist, and it planted the first seeds of distrust in law enforcement that have bloomed into a movement across the state today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for working so hard to eliminate <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> at the University of California and beyond. The program helped to get thousands of minorities into the middle class, where they promptly retreated into the comforts of whiteness. Your 180-degree turn on the issue radicalized college students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, most of all, for Proposition 187. You didn't author the 1994 measure, which declared war on immigrants in the country illegally and the people who helped them. But you jumped on the 187 bandwagon and took the reins as soon as you could to help resurrect your flagging reelection campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, Mexican Americans like me realized for the first time that a large part of society still considered us ""Mexican"" and not ""American,"" like we always believed ourselves to be. Most of us have identified with the former more than the latter ever since.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, MEChA bounced back. The Chicano high school and college group was slowly losing its power as more Mexican Americans began to identify as ""Latino"" or ""Hispanic"" and wanted no part with radical politics. Because of 187, MEChA members went on to reinvigorate the labor movement, introduce ethnic studies in high schools, and make Dia de los Muertos a thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring Latinos to enter politics like never before. And gracias for making the defense of immigrants their rallying cry. From state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra's zeal, to bringing back driver's licenses for the undocumented (which you took away), to declaring us a sanctuary state, it's all a direct response to your cynicism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring two of the most hilarious death-metal songs ever: ""Matando Gueros"" (""Killing White People"") and ""Raza Odiada"" (""Hated Race""), both by Brujeria. I certainly hope that you take their mock-assassination skit as satire at its finest, instead of a bona fide threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for providing the California Republican Party a cautionary tale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inadvertently posing for an airplane selfie two years ago with film director Alex Rivera. Your befuddled expression reminded Latinos that you're not a monster but rather just a confused fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And gracias for still not getting it. At a recent speech by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon to the Southern California Leadership Council, you complained to him that Sacramento ""ignores us,"" whatever the hell that means. (Who's ""us""?) Speaker Rendon's grace in responding to your petulance -- basically ""I'm here now"" -- was as great an example of Old and New California as Rivera could've scripted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, Governor Pedro.

They then invoked an obscure Senate rule that required the judicial candidates to be re-nominated. (Yes, these are the same Republicans who used to loudly demand that every one of President George W. Bush's nominees get a vote on the Senate floor, regardless of their qualifications.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most prominent of the five repeaters is Goodwin Liu, a law professor and legal scholar who would be the only Asian-American serving as an active judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Liu went to Stanford, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and graduated from Yale Law School. He clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before beginning a teaching career at the University of California, Berkeley,  School of Law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, it is largely his stellar background that is fueling Republican opposition. Mr. Liu, who is 39, is seen as a strong possibility to be on President Obama's short list for a future Supreme Court vacancy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives do not like Mr. Liu's support for same-sex marriage rights, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and his view that the Constitution is a living document that evolves over time. But his views fall well within the legal and political mainstream. His warnings that Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel Alito would turn out to be extremely conservative were accurate. But Mr. Liu is no rigid liberal ideologue, as his support of school vouchers and charter schools attest. Kenneth Starr, the conservative lawyer who investigated President Bill Clinton, co-signed a letter vouching for Mr. Liu's ""independence and openness to diverse viewpoints.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be nice if some Republican members of the Judiciary Committee voted for Mr. Liu and the four other re-nominees (along with three other new nominees). Whether they do or not, the White House and Senate Democrats should persist in fighting for their confirmation and the confirmation of the 16 other pending nominees already approved by the committee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the comparable point in the Bush presidency, the Senate had confirmed 61.4 percent of Mr. Bush's nominees. For Mr. Obama, it's under 50 percent. His nominees are no radicals. That description applies to Republicans holding up well-qualified choices like Mr. Liu.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

This has sparked much Monday- morning quarterbacking among industry groups and industry-funded folks as to what went wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This issue should have been a 'gimme' for the administration,"" former Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow Jonathan Adler e-mailed CEI President Fred Smith last week, insisting the merits of the issue favored the White House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Despite this . . . the administration got hammered and will continue to get hammered,"" Adler said, by enviros and ""pundits who know less about environmental law than [Environmental Protection Agency chief Christine Todd] Whitman (and that's saying something).""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem? ""Poor communication,"" writes Adler. That plus ""the utter intellectual vacuity and laziness of environmental journalists,"" he said. ""If the arsenic issue cannot be 'won,' it will be hard to win anything that matters.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus the quick turnaround on the pro-salmonella proposal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adler's e-mail notes people should have stressed that there were ""no industry beneficiaries"" in voiding the Clinton move and that there was still a federal arsenic regulation in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enviros such as Elliott Negin of the Natural Resources Defense Council, however, insists the problem was that the facts didn't back the Bush team.

We want an equal shot regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or disability, and in this nation of laws that should be assured. But like the speed limit, such laws mean nothing unless they are strictly enforced, so a proposal by the Clinton administration to boost civil rights enforcement could make a real difference. Employers, contractors, mortgage lenders and landlords would make more decisions in a truly impartial manner if failure to do so had surer and quicker consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That racial barriers persist is unquestionable. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissent against a 1995 decision concerning <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, was eloquent in describing them: ""Racial inequality . . . and discrimination's lingering effects . . . are evident in our workplaces, markets and neighborhoods. Job applicants with identical resumes, qualifications, and interview styles still experience different receptions, depending on their race. White and African American consumers still encounter different deals. People of color looking for housing still face discriminatory treatment by landlords, real estate agents and mortgage lenders.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House plan, if approved by Congress, would increase civil rights funding 17%, from $516 million to $602 million. Some Republicans may object to any increase in government. The political opposition is harder to figure. How can opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, who say they only want equal opportunity, reject tougher enforcement of existing laws enforcing equality?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A current barrier to enforcement is the overworked, underbudgeted and understaffed federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Clinton proposal would increase funding by $37 million to reduce the backlog of 64,000 cases and encourage more use of mediation, which is a quicker and less costly method of resolving disputes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's civil rights division, overseer of laws governing employment, housing, education and public accommodations, would get an 11% funding increase. To discourage housing bias, the White House would increase Housing and Urban Development Department funding by $22 million, among other things making possible the hiring of more ""testers""--applicants identical on paper but of different racial backgrounds. Their visits to landlords and real estate agents often uncover wide disparities and are the best possible measure of compliance with fair housing laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Clinton seeks to engage the nation in a debate on the divisive issue of race. Dialogue is important, but actions speak louder. Strict and timely enforcement of civil rights laws will give more people the fair shot that each of us deserves.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports	
6019bbb66e5c2815ba3728b6	test_question_pro_testing_1	"<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

He did and he was.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't remember everything that John H. Johnson, the pioneer black publisher, said when he was honored by the National Association of Black Journalists in 1987. But I probably will never forget his three words of advice:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Make yourself indispensable.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to find three better words that sum up the successful business philosophy of John Harold Johnson, who died Monday at age 87.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To black Americans of my generation, Johnson's publications Ebony, Jet and Negro Digest were indispensable reading matter, offering a brighter and more prosperous vision of black America than most of the mainstream--also known as ""white-owned""--media provided.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To advertisers, Johnson's pioneering publications broke through the myth that the black consumer market was not worth targeting through black-owned media.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today the newsstands are filled with magazines niche-marketed to blacks or Hispanics, but that really began with Johnson back in the 1940s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And to journalists, particularly black journalists, Johnson's publications provided employment, a training ground and a model for how people of color might be covered in a more complete fashion than simply crime, sports or show business stories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His 1989 autobiography ""Succeeding Against the Odds"" reads almost like a business-school series of case studies in how to solve whatever problems life throws at you.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Arkansas refused to educate black children in his area past the 8th grade, his mother, Gertrude Johnson Williams, a cook and domestic worker, saved for two years to move her family to Chicago in the 1930s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Young Johnnie was working days at a black-owned life insurance company and studying at night at Northwestern University when he started up Negro Digest in 1942 with $500 that his mother raised by borrowing against the family furniture.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When its circulation stalled at 50,000 a few months later, he persisted in requesting a guest column from Eleanor Roosevelt until she agreed, immediately boosting circulation to 100,000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1945, Johnson launched Ebony, a picture magazine for blacks. Its initial press run of 25,000 copies was completely sold out. Pocket-size Jet magazine began in 1951. Jet helped launch the modern civil rights movement in 1955 when it published open-casket funeral photos of the mangled body of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Chicagoan who was savagely murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite its annual special editions focusing thoughtfully on major issues of black politics and economics, we black journalists, among others, often ridiculed the sugar-coated emphasis that Ebony and Jet put on the upwardly ambitious black middle class. Yet we also understood Johnson's reluctance to focus on negative news about black life, since there was so much of that in the mainstream media.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bourgeois flavor of Johnson's publications was a minor criticism in the life of a man who overcame tremendous hardships to fill an important vacuum in black life and become one of America's wealthiest businessmen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With that in mind, his ""make yourself indispensable"" speech had special resonance. Speaking to his audience of predominately young and aspiring print and broadcast journalists, he offered us the example of Matthew Henson, the black man who helped Adm. Robert Peary reach the North Pole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Henson was not hired under any <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> plan or out of the goodness of Peary's heart, Johnson pointed out. Henson was hired because he had taken the time to learn the language of the Inuit people, who were indispensable to their journey.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Johnson did not mention was the equally fascinating story of how he gave an autographed copy of Henson's autobiography to Zenith Electronics Corp. chief executive officer Eugene McDonald, after hearing that McDonald was a fan of arctic explorers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McDonald was impressed enough by the gift and by a four-page Ebony feature on Henson that Zenith became Ebony's first major corporate advertiser in the 1950s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He helped persuade other major corporate advertisers to follow, a major breakthrough at the time for black-oriented media. Two decades later, Johnson was elected to Zenith's board of directors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Johnson's career was full of stories like that. His life presents case studies in leadership, which is, above all, the art of problem solving. While others might fret, moan or whine, he was a get-it- done kind of guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He understood that no one, black or otherwise, would patronize your business purely out of racial loyalty. Consumers in a free market want value, service and quality. He set a high standard for all three. Despite the changing times that his publications helped to bring about, he found ways to stay indispensable.

Gov. Joe Rogers are trotted out like trophies, an attractive serving of political correctness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up in a black Republican family. My father was a delegate from Kansas to the 1964 GOP convention. On our way to the convention in San Francisco, we were run off the road in Arizona by a car with John Birch Society bumper stickers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was only 14, but I couldn't understand my father's party loyalty. Yet when I watched him walk to the podium at the Cow Palace and give then-Pennsylvania Gov. William Scranton's seconding speech, I experienced the contradiction. I felt proud even though I knew that the Republicans had soundly defeated a proposal to strengthen the civil rights plank with pledges for speedy school desegregation, full voting rights and elimination of job bias.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Was my father flawed?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the years, I have observed that most African Americans in the Republican Party care less about identity politics than their counterparts in the Democratic Party. My father's mantra was the business of self-reliance, doing for yourself rather than waiting for the government. And his lectures to me were on how blacks must be active in both political parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in 2000, the reasons some blacks join the Republican Party are more complicated. Thirty years ago, my father, along with other civil rights activists such as then-Assistant Secretary of Labor Art Fletcher, were building a legacy. They demonstrated a commitment to the black community. Fletcher's Philadelphia Plan under Richard Nixon's presidency increased the opportunities for minorities and women to compete in the job market. The Philadelphia Plan made federal contractors meet specific goals in hiring women and minorities, the forerunner of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now, many black Republicans just enjoy unsettling people. Sound bites and big hats. Others like Rogers state that they have chosen to take the ""road less traveled."" And as I listened to him in a debate with Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) at the recent National Assn. of Black Journalists convention, I recognized the advantages of not going where the competition is fierce. For the truly politically ambitious, there appears to be an impressive list of Democratic wannabes. Why queue up behind a long line of well- established power brokers?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At that same time, however, I saw someone who was brave enough to stand up to a polite but solid wall of contempt from the black audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was never that brave. Although I was a black Republican until my father died in 1983, I only took advantage of his sweat equity. I inserted myself into the 1976 GOP convention in Kansas City and worked in the press office handling media relations for the black delegates and party leaders. In the early 1980s, because of my father and good political contacts, I was offered a public affairs position in Washington, D.C.. I was seduced by the image of power, politics and press initially, but after two weeks of trying out D.C. with interviews, meetings and receptions, I declined the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was changing and developing different political values. I observed that the era of black Republicans like my father had passed. And what I saw in its place was no longer for me. I left the party to become a Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those early days, I had considered myself a pragmatist by being Republican. Although my friends labeled me an opportunist, I rationalized that everything was a boost for my career. My commitment, however, was only to my father. Never did I reflect his loyalty to the Republican Party. Neither do the black Republicans I see today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My father had a faith in his party and its potential. He wanted to make a contribution for black people, to stand up and be counted even when it was dangerous. It was his personal honesty. It was his fine flaw.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sharon Woodson-Bryant is a Burbank freelance writer</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

That he's ""not qualified."" That the only reason he was appointed is because he's black. In other words, that he's a product of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> or, more precisely, an ""<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, for instance, liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote: ""I believe in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, but I have to acknowledge there are arguments against it. One of the more cogent is the presence of Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Robinson's comment echoes many previous attacks. In 2000, for example, Newsweek columnist Anna Quindlen -- another liberal who has written in support of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> -- declared that Thomas' ""judicial resume was mediocre; he was chosen because he was conservative and black, an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire by an administration that eschewed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many liberal Democrats aren't willing to say out loud what Robinson and Quindlen wrote so clearly. After all, they're conditioned to defend racial preferences, which they insist do not promote ""incompetent"" or ""unqualified"" people. But that doesn't mean they don't think it. Even The American Prospect magazine, a liberal journal that sees its mission as ""beating back the right wing,"" ran an article two years ago calling Thomas the ""most visible <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land, a token black nominee whose lack of qualifications was so painfully outed during his confirmation hearings.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How can you support a policy of racial preferences and then attack one of its supposed beneficiaries as undeserving? This, ultimately, is the intrinsic hypocrisy of the Thomas bashers. They allege that he's not competent and that the only reason he became a Supreme Court justice was because he's black. And in so doing, they level the exact same arguments against Thomas that they castigate conservatives for making about <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> itself. But let's face facts: A program that gives people with a certain skin color an advantage will invariably reward some who would otherwise not qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This blatant intellectual inconsistency does not stop Thomas' liberal critics from accusing him of hypocrisy -- namely, for being the ""most visible <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land"" while simultaneously standing as its most prominent black opponent. By opposing racial preferences, liberals say, Thomas -- who was accepted into Yale Law School via an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program -- is denying others the very same benefits he received.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Thomas reveals in ""My Grandfather's Son,"" his opposition to racial preferences is based on personal conscience and a genuine concern for its effects on black Americans, not selfish disregard for his racial brethren born out of self-loathing, as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> advocates would have it. He writes that he keeps his Yale diploma tucked away in his basement with a 15-cent cigar sticker affixed to its frame. Why? In a ""60 Minutes"" interview, Thomas said ""that degree meant one thing for whites and another thing for blacks. . . . It was discounted.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is one of the tragic legacies of racial preferences -- that the achievements of black people in the professional world will always be suspect, and not just to blacks who benefit from such preferences. In the minds even of liberals, blacks will always be thought of as ""<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hires"" no matter how bright or qualified they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may be difficult for well-intentioned white liberals to understand the personal insecurity that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> causes, and as a white person, I can only take someone like Thomas at his word when he writes about the shame he feels because of racial preferences. But as a gay man, I can certainly empathize, as I imagine I would feel exactly the same way if sexual orientation became a ""plus factor"" in a law school or employment application process. Factoring in a person's immutable traits demeans them and robs them of their individuality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether or not Thomas is qualified to be a Supreme Court justice, who are <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> advocates to smear him as an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hire? (Can you imagine a left-wing magazine like The American Prospect saying that about a liberal black judge? It would never happen.) But if they honestly believe Thomas is one, then they only have themselves to blame for a rotten system that privileges some people over others because of skin pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the day his Supreme Court nomination was announced by President George H.W. Bush, Thomas' critics have personally and viciously attacked him as if he were an abstraction -- representing everything they hate about minorities (whether women, gays or blacks) who do not subscribe to their liberal nostrums -- and, in so doing, have sucked him of his humanity as an individual. If liberals want to live up to their self-purported principles of equality and free inquiry, they would do well to stop treating Clarence Thomas as the scapegoat for their political agendas and start treating him like a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:David Suter For The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James Kirchick is on the editorial staff of The New Republic.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

And America's. But what might an Obama victory mean for African-Americans in particular? Should we expect his administration to play a major role in black group advancement?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than a century, black civic leaders have tangled over whether to pursue economic independence or focus their energies on integrating political, corporate and educational institutions. W.E.B. Du Bois, author of the groundbreaking 1903 treatise, ""The Souls of Black Folk,"" argued for the latter, while his contemporary, Booker T. Washington, said ""political activity alone"" was not the answer. In addition, insisted Washington, ""you must have property, industry, skill, economy, intelligence and character.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the 1960s, the black civil-rights leadership has sided with Du Bois. Between 1970 and 2001, the number of black elected officials in the U.S. grew from fewer than 1,500 to more than 9,000. And while impressive socioeconomic progress has been made, wide black-white gaps remain in educational achievement, homeownership rates, labor-force participation, income levels and other measures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor should we conclude that civil-rights laws are responsible for the black progress that has occurred. For example, up until the 1950s, and in an era of open and rampant racial discrimination, the jobless rate for blacks was much lower than today and similar to that of whites in the same age group. In fact, blacks had higher labor-force participation rates than whites in every Census taken between 1890 and 1950. And in the decades preceding the 1960s -- that is, prior to the passage of landmark civil-rights bills and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> legislation -- there were sharp rises in black educational achievement, both absolutely and relative to whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economist Thomas Sowell has spent decades researching racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. and abroad. And his findings -- in books like ""Race and Culture: A World View,"" ""Affirmative Action Around the World"" and ""Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?"" -- show that political activity generally has not been a factor in the rise of groups from poverty to prosperity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Germans came to the U.S. as indentured servants during colonial times. And while working to pay off the cost of the voyage they studiously avoided participation in politics. Only after they'd risen economically did Germans begin seeking public office, culminating with the election of presidents Hoover and Eisenhower.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern can be found among Chinese populations in southeast Asia, the Caribbean and the U.S. In Argentina, where English minorities have done well financially and played a major role in the development of the economy, they've played almost no role in Argentine politics. And so it goes with Italians in the the U.S. and Jews in Britain: In both places economic gains have generally preceded political gains. ""Empirically, political activity and political success have been neither necessary nor sufficient for economic advancement,"" writes Mr. Sowell. ""Nor has eager political participation or outstanding success in politics translated into faster group achievement.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans might keep in mind that in those rare instances where the political success of a minority group has come first, it has often resulted in slower socioeconomic progress. The Irish immigrants who came to the U.S. in the mid-19th century hailed from a country where 80% of the population was rural. Yet they settled in industrial centers like New York, Philadelphia and Boston and took low-skill jobs. Their rise from poverty was especially slow -- as late as 1920, 80% of all Irish women working in America were domestic servants -- despite the fact that Irish-run political organizations dominated many big-city governments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The Irish were fiercely loyal to each other, electing, appointing and promoting their own kind,"" writes Mr. Sowell. ""This had little effect on the average Irish American, who began to reach economic prosperity in the 20th century at about the same time when the Irish political machines began to decline.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If elected, Mr. Obama may well turn out to be a competent president, even an admirable one. But history gives us no indication that his political success will translate into black upward mobility. And given Mr. Obama's liberal leanings, there's every reason to believe that current obstacles to black progress will remain in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The candidate favors minimum-wage laws, for example, on the assumption that they help lift people out of poverty. But most poor people already earn more than the minimum wage. And most people who earn the minimum wage aren't poor. Minimum-wage laws are more likely to price people out of the labor market, especially younger and less educated workers, a large number of whom happen to be black. Today's economy places a premium on skills. If young people can't get an entry-level job because an artificial federal wage floor has made them too expensive to hire, they can't gain the skills and experience to move up the economic ladder.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take another example: Mr. Obama opposes educational choice, which will also have a negative impact on poor blacks, who tend to be the ones stuck in America's worst public schools. Mr. Obama opposes school vouchers that would allow low-income black parents to send their children to the type of private school where he sends his own daughters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both cases, the only ""change"" that Mr. Obama would be bringing the Oval Office is the color of the person perpetrating bad policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Riley is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
6074391ef6527366aa827f42	test_question_neutral_testing_1	<p>Talking About Race in Akron</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid discussions about race are difficult even in intimate settings among well-acquainted people. For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>	stance:::Neutral

Being a Chicagoan whose tax dollars helped purchase the microphones, transmitters and speakers via which these hateful, hurtful words have been broadcast, being a Chicagoan whose taxes evidently pay the wages of bigots, that's injury added to the insult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once again, Chicago has been rocked by charges that some of its firefighters aren't comfortable serving many of the people who live here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The five racist radio transmissions of recent weeks have generated more shock than surprise. The transmissions didn't occur in a void. They follow more than three decades of tension within the department since its ranks were belatedly integrated in 1968.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of that tension over the years has stayed within the city's firehouses. On rare occasion, citizens have been able to peer inside, or to listen from afar. What they've seen and heard isn't always ennobling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1997, a videotape surfaced depicting a 1990 firehouse retirement party at which firefighters were drinking, exposing themselves and uttering racial slurs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the firefighters who attended the party, James McNally, now is president of Chicago Fire Fighters Union Local 2. On another occasion, he appeared in black face to protest promotions motivated by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not to say most Chicago firefighters condone racism. But firefighters--provocateurs and innocents alike--do need to appreciate how grave these five radio incidents are, as is the delivery of a death threat to a battalion chief who heads the African American Fire Fighters League of Chicago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are times, particularly when the offenders are young or ignorant, when ugly behavior can be forgiven if not forgotten, when its perpetrators can be redeemed if not encouraged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not one of those times. This behavior, in this department, in this city, is intolerable. There is no wellspring of goodwill upon which an offending firefighter can call, no margin for middling penance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Simply put, these disgusting, dehumanizing incidents follow too much history. Fire Commissioner James Joyce declared last week that ""offenses like these will be fireable offenses."" Translation: Joyce has committed himself to judging each case individually, but he has put every one of his employees on notice that the range of penalties unquestionably includes dismissal. Mayor Richard Daley concurred, stating that a still unidentified person--thought to be a firefighter--who voiced racial slurs broadcast March 1 should admit his action and face the ""ultimate consequences.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is the correct response. When these kinds of calculated affronts to city and department policy occur, when reasonable citizens are left to wonder about the integrity of the firefighters they employ, jobs should--must--be on the line.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But whether Joyce can fulfill his own prophecy is another matter. The department terminated seven firefighters who appeared in the 1990 videotape. They challenged the dismissals before an arbitrator and eventually won back their jobs--with pension and seniority rights, the department says, although without four years of back pay.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Merely identifying whoever has been spewing filth on fire department frequencies isn't easy. One veteran firefighter who voiced racist slander, and a supervisor who didn't react properly, have been suspended over the first of the five incidents. It's likely the subsequent transmissions originated on fire department radios, but in this era of clever hackers and electronic gadgetry, the department isn't yet certain that no outsider is involved. Joyce, though, hasn't sounded like a boss who expects to learn that his own employees are innocent. Last week he denounced an ""underground Web site"" that offered firefighters tips on how to obscure their identities when transmitting over department frequencies. ""That's what we're up against,"" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's also up against an unmeasured amount of denial over society's gradual progress on race. Many of today's Chicago firefighters did come of age in a department culture that to varying degrees rewarded three attributes: skill, courage and clout. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span>, though, is about a fourth, and to some foreign, attribute: fairness. It's understandable, if not admirable, that adding fairness to the mix caused resentment among those who feel that the long-overdue accelerated promotion of minorities--a cause Joyce has advanced--is unfair to some whites who don't get those promotions. What's not understandable is for any Chicago firefighter to permit that or any other frustration to be voiced in the most vicious bigotry imaginable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Firefighters who don't share that bigotry are now in the best position to lead the department out of its difficult past. One important step is to help nail the perpetrators of the radio incidents. Public racism tends to be a team sport. It's likely someone inside or outside the department knows who originated these broadcasts. Stepping forward with that knowledge may require even more courage than racing into a burning house.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But restoring the department's integrity, like rescuing fire victims, is a critical public service. And that cause, public service, should be key to how this sorry drama concludes. Any firefighter who merely wants to fight fire is free to resign and join the U.S. Forest Service. Any firefighter who wants to serve the public--in all its varied hues, in its wide range of good and bad behaviors, in its terrible moments when disaster strikes and panic ensues--is welcome to stay.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, if a firefighter finds himself risking his own life to save the lives of Chicagoans he finds unworthy of his respect, he should find another job. Fire Commissioner Joyce is right to pursue those few who've let that lack of respect get the best of them. The hope here is that he will root them out, adjudicate their cases under the due process to which they're entitled--and subject them to the ultimate consequences Mayor Daley properly threatened last week.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

Your career helped shaped the modern-day Golden State.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a career mostly defined by a moderate approach -- an important lesson for the Democrats and Republicans of today that too few bother to remember.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a mayoral career that saw you protect San Diego's wetlands and implement <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> hiring practices. ""He believes that America's minorities have been handicapped for years,"" one campaign flier read, ""by inadequate housing, education and job opportunities, and he has dedicated his efforts to alleviating these problems."" That's a reality that more Republicans should acknowledge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for being so hurt when the Republican Party pulled their 1972 convention from San Diego that you responded with an ""America's Finest City"" campaign. You showed second-tier cities across the country that they too should be proud of who they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for proving that Republicans can take the lead in addressing America's prior racial wrongs. As senator, you cosponsored the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which granted reparations and an official government apology to Japanese Americans interned during World War II.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for showing us that a Republican governor could understand that raising taxes to help shore up public finances was a wise thing and not treason. In 1991, when California faced a record deficit, you backed tax increases for sales, the wealthy and even snacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias too for throwing away this record of centrism.

You showed future generations of politicians how not to ruin their legacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for helping to deregulate California's electricity, which led to mass blackouts in the beginning of the 2000s and convinced an entire generation that we shouldn't leave public utilities to the private market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for signing the state's three-strikes sentencing laws. The increase in prisoners proved that justice isn't blind but usually racist and always classist, and it planted the first seeds of distrust in law enforcement that have bloomed into a movement across the state today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for working so hard to eliminate <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> at the University of California and beyond. The program helped to get thousands of minorities into the middle class, where they promptly retreated into the comforts of whiteness. Your 180-degree turn on the issue radicalized college students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, most of all, for Proposition 187. You didn't author the 1994 measure, which declared war on immigrants in the country illegally and the people who helped them. But you jumped on the 187 bandwagon and took the reins as soon as you could to help resurrect your flagging reelection campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, Mexican Americans like me realized for the first time that a large part of society still considered us ""Mexican"" and not ""American,"" like we always believed ourselves to be. Most of us have identified with the former more than the latter ever since.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, MEChA bounced back. The Chicano high school and college group was slowly losing its power as more Mexican Americans began to identify as ""Latino"" or ""Hispanic"" and wanted no part with radical politics. Because of 187, MEChA members went on to reinvigorate the labor movement, introduce ethnic studies in high schools, and make Dia de los Muertos a thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring Latinos to enter politics like never before.

It's an experiment providing a ""universal basic income,"" or UBI, to low-income Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In conjunction with the Marin Community Foundation, which plans to contribute $3 million to the effort, the Marin County Board of Supervisors has allocated $400,000 in public funds for the experiment. The program is similar to one recently completed in Stockton, Calif., but one major difference sets the Marin experiment apart: race and sex discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Stockton UBI experiment provided payments to 125 residents of neighborhoods at or below Stockton's median household income. The Marin regime will do the same, but beneficiaries must be ""mothers of color."" That term is undefined, but it's clear that fathers and white mothers are ineligible to participate. A similar race-based scheme has been announced in Oakland, Calif.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter what one thinks of UBI as a policy matter, the use of public funds in the Marin scheme is legally dubious. The California Constitution's equal-protection clause, like the federal one in the 14th Amendment, applies ""strict scrutiny""—the highest possible level of judicial scrutiny—to racial classifications. California courts, unlike federal ones, also apply strict scrutiny to sex classifications. In Connerly v. State Personnel Board (2001), a California appeals court made that clear in invalidating both race- and sex-based <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If I had grown up in Marin County under its proposed UBI regime, my family would have been ineligible to participate. I grew up poor and at times homeless or living in public housing projects. But my mother, who is white, was raising her three black children on her own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin Community Foundation's chief executive, Thomas Peters, has said that ""this first cohort will focus on low-income moms of color"" because they face ""the greatest aggregate of challenges: low income, young children and facing the daily travails and insults of overt and covert racial discrimination.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My mother was low-income, had three young children and faced racial discrimination. We lived in black communities where black men were stigmatized for consorting with white women, and that stigma flowed to those women and their biracial children.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If my mother was somehow privileged over similarly situated black mothers, it could only have been by the slimmest possible margin. To exclude someone like her from a public-assistance program on account of her skin color is the very definition of racial injustice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin UBI scheme threatens to drive the wedge of racial discord currently tearing wildly through our social fabric even deeper. And frankly, policies with good intentions such as UBI, which might conceivably help to address the intractable problem of poverty, will be tainted with the scarlet R of racism and the understandable suspicion of being a pretense for reparative racial justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Westhill is president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marin County's Discriminatory 'Universal Basic Income'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Devon Westhill</p></div>"				stance:::Against/Opposes

It is New York City's crown jewel, where - like in the fictional Lake Wobegon - all the students really are ""above average."" And just to make matters more intriguing and complicated, Stuyvesant's student body is majority Asian American</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>. The mayor thinks this is a ""monumental injustice"" and that more of the students should be Hispanic and black. For that, he recently asked congregants at a black church for an ""amen.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, from certain critics, he got a groan of opposition and disbelief. In the name of racial equity, fairness and that most deceptive of all words, diversity, he would demolish a system that at Stuyvesant and seven other elite city high schools has, without a doubt, propelled countless poor kids right into the middle class - and beyond.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason I mentioned Trump in the first paragraph is that his base consists, in no small part, of white males who think the deck is stacked against them; that the liberal policies of the Obama years, personified by Hillary Clinton, unfairly favored other groups or, when it came to trade, other nations. You and I may quibble with this view, but then along comes Mayor Bill de Blasio to demand an ""amen"" to his efforts to tilt a color-blind admissions system to get a different blend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Blacks and Hispanics comprise 67 percent</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>of New York's public school students. Yet Stuyvesant's incoming freshman class contains only 10 black students, 27 Hispanics, 151 whites - and 613 Asian Americans. A similar imbalance applies to the city's seven other elite schools, including Brooklyn Tech, where the mayor's son just graduated. Clearly, something is off. In the best of all possible worlds, these schools should have student bodies that reflect the city's demographics. This, though, is not the best of all worlds. It's the one we have.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And in this world, the children of Asian immigrants walk away with the lion's share of admissions. Why? Simple. They study. They study hard. Admissions to New York's academically elite schools is based solely on an entrance exam. That's it. No alumni recommendations. No offer of a contribution. No athletic ability or anything of the sort. Take the test. Score high. Get in. Nothing could be fairer. Yet, de Blasio, a Democrat, wants to do away with the exam all together.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an exhaustive piece for the City Journal about Brooklyn's Chinese American community - one of New York's several Chinatowns - Kay S. Hymowitz writes that ""If, as sometimes appears the case, 'Harvard' is the first English word that immigrant Chinese mothers learn, the second is probably 'Stuyvesant.' ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reading Hymowitz's description of how these parents work around the clock for their children - rising before dawn to ensure that homework is done - is exhausting in itself. Often, they put aside money to have their kids prepped for the Stuyvesant admissions test. This is not a perk of the rich. This is yet another sacrifice these parents make for their children.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My limited tolerance for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> - possibly permissible when the poor are advantaged at the expense of the rich - hits a wall in this case. By and large, the Asian Americans of Stuyvesant are not rich. Many of them are poor, so-called Title I kids, entitled to all sorts of aid. They and their parents played by the rules and studied hard. Why should they be deprived - on the basis of race or ethnicity - of what they earned? That's what the mayor wants to happen. Asian American kids have to make way for black or Hispanic ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The figures are both stark and tragic. But they prove, to the obstinate blindness of the doctrinaire, that poverty is not always the determinant. You can hardly get poorer than many of the Asian immigrants. They come to America with little. Many can't even speak English. In her article, Hymowitz says Chinese families often ""maintain that they have been discriminated against, and they tell their children to expect discrimination as well."" It's a hard, hard life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already, the mayor has reserved some slots for students whoalmostpass the exam so that more black and Hispanic kids will be admitted to the special schools. For him, it is only a beginning.

When asked in March 2002 why he rarely mentioned Osama bin Laden anymore, which three of these statements did Mr. Bush make?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Osama who?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) I know he is on the run.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) I truly am not that concerned about him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) He's just another one of the dead-enders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) We haven't heard much from him. And I wouldn't necessarily say he's at the center of any command structure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2. When Tom Brokaw asked Mr. Kerry about a report that Mr. Bush's I.Q. was higher than his, how did he respond?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) But he doesn't even speak French.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) I've never misunderestimated his intelligence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) That's great. More power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) This just shows, once again, that the president has been deliberately hiding the truth from the American public.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) It's a great boost in our campaign to connect with voters who are still trying to figure out which candidate to support. I mean, these folks are obviously not Mensa material.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3. How did President Bush propose to save Social Security?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Raise the retirement age to 90.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Impose an excise tax on cruise-ship fares and early-bird-special meals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Encourage the exportation of Medicare recipients to Canada.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Allow young workers to invest contributions in private savings accounts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Deny flu shots to senior citizens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4. A Kerry commercial titled ''January Surprise'' warns that ''Bush has a plan to cut Social Security benefits by 30 to 45 percent.'' The campaign bases this on one of several options proposed by a bipartisan commission, but not endorsed by Mr. Bush, to peg future benefit increases to consumer prices instead of wages. What is the current age of the oldest American who would hypothetically be affected by the 45 percent differential cited in the commercial?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) 4</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) 14</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) 24</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) 34</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) 44</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5. Which two of the following animals have been featured in advertisements supporting Mr. Bush?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) A mountain lion defending its den.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Wolves lurking at the edge of a forest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Flying monkeys abducting a troop of Girl Scouts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) A white poodle, wearing a Kerry sweater and a pink bow, captioned ''That dog don't hunt.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) A squawking chicken being chased by a butcher wearing a checkered headdress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>6. Which two of the following animals have been featured in advertisements supporting Mr. Kerry?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a ) A soaring eagle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) A bull in a Pottery Barn smashing a set of china labeled ''Iraq.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) A watchdog sleeping while foxes carry off chickens and sticks of dynamite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) An ostrich with its head in the sand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Three blind mice searching for a piece of cheese labeled ''W.M.D.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>7. Last week Mr. Kerry criticized Mr. Bush over the disappearance of explosives from a site in Iraq. What is the name of the site?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Al Qaeda</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Al Dente</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Al Qaqaa</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Al Qaselzur</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Al Roker</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>8. In a survey of 980 people stopped on the street in 10 cities, the Pere Partnership advertising agency asked respondents how their votes were swayed by the political activism of Charlton Heston, Michael Moore and Bruce Springsteen. What was the most common response?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) It swayed me to vote for the celebrity's candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) It swayed me to vote for the other candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>9. In the same survey, respondents were asked to name the celebrity whose endorsement was least likely to make them vote for a presidential candidate. Here are the four names mentioned the most often. Place them in order, starting with the celebrity least likely to sway anyone's vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Martha Stewart.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) O.J. Simpson</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Paris Hilton</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Mike Tyson</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>10. What phrase did the Kerry campaign use to describe the coalition assembled by President Bush in Operation Iraqi Freedom?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) A coalition of the coerced and the bribed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) A bunch of yo-yos.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) The unspeakable in search of the incredible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) The gang that couldn't shoot straight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) N.O.C.D. (Not our class, dear).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>11. During the second presidential debate, what position did Mr. Bush say he would find unacceptable in a Supreme Court justice?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Pro-euthanasia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Pro-abortion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Pro-fluoridation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Pro-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Pro-slavery.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>12. When asked by Bob Woodward if he had consulted with his father about the decision to invade Iraq, what did President Bush say?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Wouldn't have been prudent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) I would have if he'd won a second term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) He is the wrong father to appeal to in terms of strength. There is a higher father that I appeal to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Just because someone has defeated Saddam Hussein once doesn't make him an expert.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) I tried, but he was stuck on this notion that it would take a lot of troops.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>13. What new strategy is the Kerry campaign planning for Ohio on Tuesday?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Carrying voters to the polls in sedan chairs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Posting security guards along Lake Erie to prevent Mr. Kerry from windsurfing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Promising toasters to the first 10 voters at each polling place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Employing a ''snack czar'' to hand out food to voters in line.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Assigning each voter a ''personal lawyer.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>14. According to The Associated Press, a Democratic politician campaigning for Mr. Kerry in Florida declared, ''If we were living in another country and we had the president of the country and his brother controlling one of the biggest provinces or states, we would ... have some doubts about whether, given their track record, they really believe in democracy.'' Who said it?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) A former vice president and senator whose father was a senator.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) A senator of a populous state whose brothers served simultaneously as president and attorney general.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) A congressman who is the son of the senator whose brothers served as president and attorney general.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) A former cabinet official whose father was governor of one of the biggest states and who married the niece of the senator whose brothers served as president and attorney general.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) A senator elected in one of the biggest states while her husband was president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>15. Identify Hans Blix.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) A former United Nations weapons inspector.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) A Norwegian laundry detergent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) The leader described by Mr. Bush as the ''Danishian prime minister.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) A character on ''Saturday Night Live'' who mocked ''girlie-men.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) One of Santa's reindeer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Answers1:b, c, e; 2:c; 3:d; 4:a; 5:b, d; 6:a, d; 7:c; 8:b; 9:c, b, d, a; 10:a; 11:e; 12:c; 13:d; 14:e; 15:a.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawings (Illustrations by Stephen Savage)</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

It has been more than 40 years since the court first ruled on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and found that some racial considerations in higher education did not offend the Constitution or federal law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is banned in nine states (including California, Florida and Michigan), and public sentiment — as seen in a Pew Research Center survey in 2019 that found that 73 percent of Americans said colleges and universities should not consider race or ethnicity when making decisions about student admissions — is far from unanimous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justin Driver, the Robert R. Slaughter professor of law at Yale University, has written a guest essay for Times Opinion that describes a middle path between the full repeal of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and its persistence on campus. In his piece, Driver writes about how Justice Sandra Day O’Connor (for whom he served as a Supreme Court clerk) wrote a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003 that upheld <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. In that opinion, she wrote that the court “expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.” Driver argues that the years remaining on the clock that started with Grutter could offer public and private institutions of higher learning a way to adapt to race-neutral admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In another essay last week, Linda Greenhouse, who reported on the Supreme Court for The Times from 1978 to 2008, casts the upcoming oral arguments as evidence that the meaning of Brown v.

6074391ef6527366aa827f42	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2213159829.xml.txt	"<div><p>Morning Views</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“The Senate is about to begin debate on a bill that could, at long last, put an end to the indiscriminate bulk collection of Americans’ telephone records,” according to an editorial in The New York Times. The bill will “bring needed transparency to the abusive spying programs that have tarnished the nation’s reputation.” Introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the measure would require the government “to disclose how many people’s data was collected by intelligence agencies, and how many of those people were American.” Perhaps most important, the bill will “create a panel of advocates to argue before the court in support of privacy rights and civil liberties, and would require the court to issue public summaries of its decisions that specifically detail the impact on those rights.” It “represents a breakthrough in the struggle against the growth of government surveillance power.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other significant viewpoints from around the world:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An editorial in The Washington Post supports a decision handed down by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the University of Texas at Austin’s <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> admissions policies. “This was not much of a surprise,” The Post writes. “The 5th Circuit sided with the university last time it examined the case.” Nevertheless, it’s an important move: The Post cites it as “a prime example of the sort that should survive judicial scrutiny.” Texas’s “top 10 percent program” guarantees admission for students in the top 10 percent of every public high-school graduating class, but the U.T. Austin “fills the rest of its classes with students who get in under a comprehensive, holistic review of their academic and personal records.” When the case returns to the Supreme Court, the justices should affirm that U.T.’s “conscientiously designed” program, a cautious effort to complement the race-neutral top 10 percent program and seek diversity, is permissible.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Massachusetts State Legislature “took a big step toward addressing the U.S. Supreme Court’s objections to the state’s ‘buffer-zone’ law,” according to an editorial in The Boston Globe. The buffer-zone law prohibited protesting within 35 feet of the entrance to abortion clinics — it was “deemed by the court to be overly broad, restricting the free speech of the plaintiffs, who sought to dissuade women from having abortions by quietly handing them literature and urging them to consider alternatives.” This new law would permit law-enforcement officers to order protesters to withdraw from an abbreviated buffer zone “if they impede access to the clinic.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“For the past five months, the world’s most important unelected official has been a 67-year-old former economics professor, who’s apparently still pre-gentrified Brooklyn enough to pronounce guide ‘goyd,’” says an editorial in The Guardian. Since Janet Yellen’s appointment to chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, she has “displayed the greatest acuity about what rate-setters must do: ‘The low rate of wage growth is, to me, another sign that the Fed’s job is not yet done.’ Bingo!” The difference between Ms. Yellen and her British counterpart, Mark J. Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is that “while Mr. Carney has his sights set on unemployment, Ms. Yellen doesn’t just want Americans off the dole — she wants to get them a pay rise too.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“The massive, worldwide die-off of honeybees has been one of the biggest environmental scares of this new century,” says an editorial in The Globe and Mail. “The possible extinction of the planet’s most prolific pollinator is more than a bit terrifying.” But “colony collapse disorder, while a real threat, is being remarkably well managed.” Governments, scientists and beekeepers “have been making steady progress against it” — the European Union has imposed a two-year ban on three types of pesticide especially harmful to bees to measure whether their absence improves bee-colony health. Meanwhile, the Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists “has done and excellent job of monitoring wintering losses since colony collapse disorder first came to light,” and their annual reports since show a slowly declining average mortality rate during winter months. “There is more work and research to be done, but the outlook is hopeful.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“Last week, the U.N. Committee on Human Rights called on Japan to ensure that effective, independent and impartial investigations be launched into wartime sex slavery and to offer an apologia to ‘comfort women,’ who were forced to work in its military brothels,” according to an editorial in The Korea Herald. Tokyo rejected the committee’s request. “While expressing regrets about the recommendation, the Abe government denied again that Korean and other Asian women were coerced into military sex slavery.” This historical revisionism is “angering Korea and other victimized Asian countries,” The Herald writes, and if Japan wishes to maintain “harmonious, friendly relations” with Korea, Mr. Abe’s government must come to terms with its colonial history.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral			
595bee9282be5500017ad683	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1372854272.xml.txt	"<div><p>Three Justices Bound by Beliefs, Not Just Gender</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WASHINGTON --  You can tell a lot about the Supreme Court by looking at who voted with whom. There are 36 possible pairs of justices, and in the term just concluded something interesting happened.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The top three spots were all taken by pairs of women. However you matched them up, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan voted together at least 93 percent of the time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The alignments are a product of ideology, not biology. ""They are the three most liberal justices on the court, and it makes sense that they would often be in agreement,"" said Pamela Harris, an adviser to the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown's law school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The voting pattern highlighted the rightward drift of the fourth member of the court's liberal wing, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who broke from his usual allies in a series of important privacy cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, it was often the conservative justices who voted together the most: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., say, or Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. This year, the right was more fractured. (The statistics come from Scotusblog, and the trends hold whether you look at all cases or just divided ones.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three female justices also dominated Supreme Court arguments in the last term. Justice Ginsburg asked the first question 37 percent of the time. Justice Sotomayor asked the most questions, averaging more than 21 in each hourlong argument.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Kagan, a former dean of Harvard Law School and a former United States solicitor general, by many accounts asked the best questions of any of the justices. They were crisp and conversational and probed the heart of the case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The spotlight often captured Justice Sotomayor this term, as her best-selling memoir gave rise to a book tour that drew adoring crowds. She was profiled on ""60 Minutes,"" talked with Oprah Winfrey and Jon Stewart, and visited ""Sesame Street"" and ""The View.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lawyers who appear before her say she is a source of inspiration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I think she has come into her own and is establishing herself as a formidable and independent presence,"" said Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter in Washington who has argued 33 cases before the court and served as a law clerk to Justice Ginsburg. ""Like the other two women, she's very comfortable up there, and that's a great thing for a woman like me to see.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked by e-mail for an assessment of Justice Sotomayor, a normally sober political scientist did not stint on her exclamation points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""People love her!"" wrote Lee Epstein, who teaches at the University of Southern California. ""She made a lot of money!""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Sotomayor's financial disclosure forms show that she has received more than $3 million for the book.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Ginsburg's form for last year also contained an interesting disclosure.

McElroy, a law professor at Drexel University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It's important to note that the agreement was not on 'women's' or 'social justice' issues,"" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The female justices were divided in two of the term's biggest cases, Professor McElroy added. Justice Sotomayor wanted to provide an answer to whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, while the other two women said the court was powerless to decide the question in the context of a challenge to California's ban on the practice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor also split on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, with Justice Ginsburg filing the lone dissent in a case that sent a challenge to the University of Texas's <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> plan back to the lower courts for a second look under a more demanding standard. (Justice Kagan, who worked on the case as solicitor general, recused herself.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at University of California, Irvine, ""they are the three most liberal justices on the court, and so it is not surprising given their ideological similarity that they vote together the most.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Breyer, the next most liberal justice, voted with conservative justices in a decision allowing the police to take DNA samples from arrestees and in dissents from rulings limiting the use of police dogs to sniff for drugs outside homes and warrantless blood testing of people stopped for drunken driving.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all three cases, he and Justice Scalia traded places, with Justice Scalia joining the three women in pressing for broad Fourth Amendment protections.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I ought to be the pinup of the criminal defense bar,"" Justice Scalia told an audience at the University of Wyoming in October. He had been hunting in Wyoming, with Justice Kagan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia described their trip in an interview in February with Nina Totenberg at George Washington University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It was, unfortunately, not successful,"" he said. ""We got antelope tags, which are expensive for out of state, and mule deer tags. Didn't get a single shot at an antelope or a mule deer. So she ended up killing a white-tailed doe, which she could have done in my driveway.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""She dropped that doe with one shot,"" he said of Justice Kagan's exercise of her Second Amendment rights. ""Boom. Just like that.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia is also close to Justice Ginsburg, but there are limits to their friendship.

A few students -- we won't pretend to know how many -- have been plotting a swell trick to lampoon the sometimes wretched excesses of political correctness on campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As far as that goes, who can complain? American academia wears no single ideological facepaint. But in the aggregate, the thinking of the professoriate (and often the earnest studentoriate, too) can self-censor dangerous thoughts. These thoughts include any suggestion that individuals or groups deserve to be critiqued let alone -- heaven forfend! -- criticized. So unless the group in question holds authority, or wealth, or is otherwise by definition oppressive, even honest critiques or criticisms tend to be unwelcome. Judgment can be, you know, so judgmental.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if your worldview is more impish than that, how best to make fun of the people, the cultural values, that others hold so sacrosanct?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One whispered proposal at Columbia is an ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale,"" at which white or Asian students would be charged markedly more for pastries than Latino or African-American or Native- American customers. The point is to confront the college community with the purported silliness of discriminating -- favorably and unfavorably -- on the basis of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not irreverent enough for you? How about a rollicking game of ""Catch an Illegal Immigrant""? Players compete for a bounty by trying to corral a student who dresses up as, say, a Guatemalan border- runner. (Extra yuks if the ""illegal"" pours water down his back, thus rendering it wet. What a hoot!)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Don't think ill of Columbia. Peruse news databases and you'll find similar antics at elite universities by the dozen. Columbia's students are distinguished by restraint: They'd be late to this party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ours being a free country, there's nothing illegal about insulting groups of people in ways that some individuals in those groups might find hurtful. But noted wit Don Imus has done all of us a courtesy by letting us see the pain that a moment of hilarity can cause others. The young women from Rutgers University had the perfect response to Imus' game. They wouldn't play.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ignoring obnoxiousness is such a marvelous retort that it's remarkable how rarely most of us do that. The typical campus reaction to bake sales and immigrant games is to form committees, and draft policies, and pronounce prohibitions -- exercises in correctness that, yes, only betray an overweening fealty to correctness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So if spring frolics bring a clever bake sale or border game to a campus near you, let it be. And try to imagine how Don Imus felt when he realized how his momentary fun had wounded some college kids who aren't as fortunate as he.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>				stance:::Against/Opposes
595bee9282be5500017ad683	aa_opeds_sample/txt/398955309.xml.txt	"<div><p>Cross Country: A Tale of Two Daleys</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chicago -- Power, like yogurt and celebrity, is generally thought to have an expiration date. Not always, not everywhere -- and not, apparently, here in Chicago, where one family, the Daleys, has controlled the political action from City Hall for going on four decades. Richard J. Daley, or Daley pere, was mayor of the city from 1955 to 1976, and died in office; Richard M. Daley, or Daley fils, began his run in 1989, and it begins to look as if I, who am five years his elder, am quite likely to die while he is still in office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From time to time a local politician makes a noise suggesting that he would like to make a run at the Daley dynasty, as by now it must be reckoned. Most recently, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., who does a fair impression of a serious politician -- unlike his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who does a very poor imitation of Martin Luther King Jr. -- has criticized Daley fils for yet another of the small- and large-bore scandals -- this one having to do with <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> contracts -- that are as indispensable to Chicago politics as nitrogen to plant life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Jackson is on record as saying, ""I am concerned about the reports of rampant corruption and fraud and abuse in the city. I'm interested in our city restoring honesty and integrity in our government."" (Pause here for chortle followed by yawn.) He also insists that he has no intention of opposing Daley fils in his run for his sixth term as mayor in 2007, though he wouldn't rule it out. (Pause here for raised left eyebrow followed by cynical smile.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet whoever might run against him in 2007 -- even if candidates were to include a combined reincarnation of Winston Churchill, Gandhi, Disraeli, and the Archangel Michael -- Daley fils will be, as they say in Vegas, a prohibitive favorite. To be sure, he has done some very high-handed things in office; the most impressive of all in this line was plowing up Meigs Field, the city's small downtown lakeshore airport the survival of which everyone else thought was still up for discussion, and doing it, as the mystery writers like to say, by dark of night. But most Chicagoans don't seem to hold any of it against him. Hey, the kid's OK.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corruption, like sexual satisfaction, is relative. Corruption under Daley pere was widespread and wide open. Everything that passed through City Hall was for sale: health and building inspectors, cops, judges, even in one notorious instance -- the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon presidential election -- the White House. (I first heard the motto ""Vote early, vote often"" during this election, where it was more a modus operandi than a mere motto.) Some people see corruption as intrinsic to, if not inherent in, big-city government, and I'm afraid that I happen to be one of them, but then I'm an American, like the man said, Chicago-born.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one has ever accused the Daleys, father or son, of being thieves. Their interest has never been in money -- only in what money can do to smooth the way to power, which for them has always been the real point and prize of politics. Critics of Rich Daley -- the father was known as Dick, a harder name for a more obdurate man -- say that politics in Chicago under him is business as usual. I don't believe this is quite so, but in any case if corruption has gone on during his administrations, he at least has provided real compensations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chicago was once a city distinguished by having not one but two skid rows: one on south State Street, the other on west Madison. Under Rich Daley both have been replaced by charming neighborhoods lived in for the most part by the go-go young. Once drab and dreary neighborhoods show new buildings, lots of rehab, and Starbucks as far as the eye can see. Where squalor once was, youthful gentry now reside.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everywhere around the city flowers and trees have been planted. The new Millennium Park, with its Frank Gehry outdoor concert hall, skating rink, modern sculptures, charming walkways, and fields for lolling is a great hit with everyone who has seen it. The Chicago of my youth, filled with gruff cigar-smoking pols in size 48 suits, suddenly seems a city for the young, who appear delighted to be in a city with so much to offer and themselves lend the metropolis a winning liveliness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Between the Daleys, especially when Harold Washington and his successor Eugene Sawyer, both black men, were in office, racial feeling in the city was raw and the confrontations between blacks and whites in the City Council was ugly. Rich Daley has done a good deal to eliminate that. No one, I think, would say that he is in the least racist. Cliche though it sounds, he really does seem to want to be the mayor of all Chicagoans. In the 2003 four-candidate mayoral election, he won 79% of the vote, though voter turnout was down to only 34%, expressing either satisfaction or voter apathy, or (most likely) confidence that he was unbeatable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rich Daley appears to have no theory of government, but merely a boundless appetite for governing. He is a fix-it, a problem-solving, man, treating the city of Chicago as if it were an unending episode of ""This Old House"" -- and he seems to be turning the old heap into a damn stately mansion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps the real secret behind the Daley family success is the fixed but limited ambition of both father and son. Neither Dick nor Rich Daley ever aspired to rise any higher than Mayor of the City of Chicago. Dick Daley, doubtless, enjoyed being a kingmaker and a power in the Democratic Party; this would appear to be less true of Rich Daley, but then the age of king-making Democratic Party bosses seems to be over. A homeboy, the current mayor does not wish to become governor or a U.S. senator, or -- here's a thought to pass on to the search committee in Cambridge -- the next president of Harvard. That goes a good way to explaining why he is so good at his job and why he is likely to be able to keep it for as long as he likes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Epstein is the author, most recently, of ""Envy"" (Oxford, 2003).</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

In an unprecedented move on the first day, Democrats tried to shut down the hearing by complaining that Republicans were withholding documents about Kavanaugh's record. Republicans accused Democrats of political grandstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it was all over, the highly qualified and reliably conservative judge was headed for approval in the Senate Judiciary Committee, albeit with Republican votes only.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This surely has been the most contentious hearing since [Clarence] Thomas"" in 1991, said University of Georgia law professor Lori Ringhand, who has written a history of court confirmation hearings. ""Cooperation among the committee members seems to have completely broken down.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She said the hearing continued the trend of revealing less and less about a nominee's views. ""Kavanaugh seemed to provide firm answers to even fewer substantive questions than [Justice Neil M.] Gorsuch, who provided fewer firm answers than any nominee for decades. In my opinion, this strips the process of much of its value.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Thomas confirmation in 1991 had stood alone as unusually contentious for two reasons. Thomas was a 43-year-old black conservative with a thin record when he was tapped to succeed Justice Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights legend. And after a week of hearings, the public learned that Anita Hill, a former aide, had accused him of sexual harassment. Nonetheless, Thomas won confirmation on a 52-48 vote in a Senate controlled by Democrats. He then joined a court where most of the justices had won unanimous Senate confirmation, including Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, there has been a steady decline in the number of senators who will cross party lines to confirm a high court nominee. In 1993, President Clinton's first nominee, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, won with a 96-3 vote. In 2005, President George W. Bush's first nominee, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., won on a 78-22 vote. In 2009, President Obama's first nominee, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, won on a 68-31 vote. And last year, Gorsuch, President Trump's first nominee, won by a 54-45 vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was the lone Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee to support Obama's nominees. On Thursday, he bemoaned the raucous partisanship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""People wonder,"" he said, ""are these hearings turning into a circus?"" But Graham said this was not fair nor accurate. ""Circuses are entertaining, and you can take your children to them. This hearing is neither entertaining nor appropriate for young people."" He referred to the regular shout-outs from protesters who were dragged from the hearing room.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators from both major parties often speak of their desire for a ""neutral"" judge who will simply follow the law and rule fairly without bias. But their actions tell a different story.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the Republicans joined together in 2016 to block even a hearing for a highly qualified Obama nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now all the Democrats, at least on the committee, are united in their opposition to Kavanaugh to fill the seat of the recently retired Kennedy, the high court's swing justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservative scholars credited Kavanaugh with a strong, steady performance amid the partisan squabbling. ""He is an experienced, thoughtful and intelligent mainstream judicial conservative. I do not believe we learned anything new about him, but we have learned a bit about the new normal in terms of collegiality in the Senate and the depth of activists' frustration with the administration,"" said Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Women's rights advocates and liberal scholars were not reassured by his testimony. ""Our fears about the future of this country deepened this week when Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly refused to answer questions about his views on abortion, employment discrimination, immigration and healthcare. Our civil rights, dignity and autonomy will be in grave danger if he is confirmed,"" said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, pointed to the jarring contrast between Kavanaugh's public praise for the Brown vs. Board of Education school desegregation ruling and his private White House memos deriding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies. ""Seeing him use words like 'naked racial set-aside' and 'racial spoils system' to refer to race-conscious measures intended to redress entrenched systemic racism is upsetting,"" Wydra said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump promised to appoint justices who would vote to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that established a woman's right to choose abortion, and Democrats pressed Kavanaugh to explain his views. He repeatedly said Roe was a ""precedent,"" but would not say it was correctly decided.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he described the 1974 ruling in United States vs. Nixon, which required the president to turn over the Watergate tapes, as correct and one of the great moments in the court's history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cornell law professor Michael Dorf was a clerk for Kennedy in 1992, when the court reaffirmed the right to abortion in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, and said Kavanaugh's comments did not signal he would uphold abortion rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Understood in context, he said very little,"" Dorf said, except that Roe and Casey are precedents. ""There is good reason to think that in addition to Justice Thomas, Chief Justice Roberts and Justices [Samuel A.] Alito and Gorsuch would overrule Roe if presented with the opportunity,"" he said. If so, he said, Kavanaugh could supply the fifth vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When asked about same-sex marriage, Kavanaugh took a different approach that may be significant. He spoke of a passage from Kennedy's opinion in June in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case that endorsed equal rights for gays and lesbians. Kavanaugh noted correctly that nearly all the justices, including the leading conservatives, signed the opinion, which -- as he paraphrased it -- said that ""the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans, or gay and lesbian couples, as second-class citizens or inferior in dignity or worth are over in the Supreme Court. That's a very important statement.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) had asked him to say whether the 2015 ruling in Obergefell vs. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage was correctly decided. It is a ""yes or no"" question, she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kavanaugh refused to answer, repeating his statement that a nominee should not give a ""thumbs-up or thumbs-down"" response to recent rulings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leading gay rights advocates said they were not reassured. They noted the court in the Masterpiece case ruled that the Colorado cake maker was treated unfairly based on his Christian beliefs. Sharon McGowan, a lawyer for the gay rights advocacy group Lambda Legal, said Kavanaugh's ""bobbing and weaving to avoid endorsing Obergefell speaks volumes. It signals not only to us, but also to his most fervent supporters, that he is prepared to grant religious opt-outs from nondiscrimination laws that are designed to protect LGBT people and their families.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the next year, the court is likely to take up another religious rights case, possibly from a florist in western Washington state who refused to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. The court's conservatives are likely to look favorably on her claim for a religious exemption from the state's civil rights law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is no sign the court's conservatives are interested in revisiting the issue of same-sex marriage. Abortion remains highly disputed, and several Republican-led states are likely to enact bans on abortion that will send the issue back before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, conservative lawmakers are not pressing to enact new bans on same-sex marriage, and as Kavanaugh's comment suggested, there is no reason to believe such a challenge would be welcome at the high court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>david.savage@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: BRETT KAVANAUGH takes a break Thursday from his confirmation hearing with former players of a youth basketball team he coached.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Drew Angerer Getty Images</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

As executive director of the Rev. Pat Robertson's very big, influential and conservative Christian Coalition, Reed has vigorously opposed mainstream civil rights leaders on such key issues as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and welfare reform.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, the idea of Beijing hosting the notoriously Red-baiting Nixon sounded laughable, too, until it happened. At least Reed has a shorter leap to make than Nixon did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reed has long called on white, Christian conservatives to make amends for centuries they spent on the wrong side of black liberation. In his 1994 book, ""Politically Incorrect: The Emerging Faith Factor in American Politics,"" he wrote that historical cooperation with slavery and segregation ""undermined the moral authority of religious conservatives as they have sought to redress other forms of social injustice--abortion, euthanasia, religious bigotry--in recent times.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To plug the gap, the coalition has announced Samaritan Project, a multiracial program to rejuvenate low-income, inner-city neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Headed by an African-American, the Rev. Earl Jackson, the coalition's national liaison for community development, the Samaritan Project offers compassionate conservatives a chance to put their money where their mouths are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among other ideas, it proposes a new multiracial partnership to revitalize local churches and rejuvenate the national debate on racial justice. It commits the coalition's members and its network of 125,000 churches to raise funds for partnerships with 1,000 inner-city churches by 2000, particularly for those churches which are helping at-risk youths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On racial justice, the coalition plans a May conference in Baltimore to which black and white church leaders from across the nation are invited to hammer out an agenda for cooperation ""across racial and cultural lines.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a conference call with me and six other newspaper columnists last week, Reed and Jackson said the project was inspired by the organization's successful call for white churches to help rebuild black churches destroyed in last year's wave of church burnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Reed and Jackson said, they have raised $850,000 and given away most of it in grants averaging $20,000 per church to 40 congregations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""African-American leaders were far more receptive than I ever thought possible,"" Reed said. ""I never asked people whether they were Democratic or Republican or liberal or conservative. It has changed us. God took a tragedy and turned it into something good.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The help could hardly go to a better place. The black church has been the African-American community's most durable and liberating institution through times much tougher than these. Black church leaders were the core of the abolitionist movement, the civil rights movement and countless independent, self-help neighborhood housing and social service programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, their successes usually wind up on the back pages of local newspapers, if at all, making a very small blip on the media's or the public's radar screens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Christian Coalition can bring the communications network that can help black churches feel less isolated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It can also bring about public attention that can help change society's prevailing cynicism about the ability of poor people to help themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Publicity does have its virtues. Assignment editors who yawn at the efforts of a little church here or there suddenly perk up when Ralph Reed holds a press conference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the less noble side, there is no question that conservatives hope the Samaritan Project will improve not only their moral authority but also their political clout. In return, the coalition hopes it can win black support for an array of ideas liberal leaders tend to oppose: school vouchers, a tax credit (not just a deduction) for charitable donations, tax breaks to encourage business investments in depressed areas and vouchers for schools and drug rehabilitation programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each of these ideas is currently being proposed in various forms in the House by Oklahoma's J.C. Watts, Congress' only black Republican, and in the Senate by Republican Daniel Coats of Indiana.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So be it. Black church leaders will have to decide for themselves whether the Samaritan Project is manna from Heaven or a Trojan horse. In the meantime, I am delighted, after years of racially polarized national politics, to see conservatives compete with liberals for black support. It's also refreshing to see churches take the lead again for racial reconciliation. We can use a few miracles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustrtion by David Csicsko.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

The leadership of Apple, where Ms. Smith works, was only 3 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic  in 2016. A recent report by Recode found that women made up at most 30 percent of leadership roles and no more than 27 percent of technical roles at major tech companies. The percentages of black and Latino employees in leadership was even more dismal, ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.The shift toward focusing on viewpoint or cognitive diversity may trace its roots back to the 1978 Supreme Court decision Regents of the University of California v.

595bee9282be5500017ad683	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2565796466.xml.txt	"<div><p>Opinion: California's values, not just Gavin Newsom, are on the recall ballot</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In opposing the recall of Gov. Gavin Newsom, we have said that California’s values are at stake as well. The leading Republican candidates, particularly front-runner Larry Elder, don’t support the values most Californians hold dear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And what are those values? There’s no official definition cast in bronze at the state Capitol in Sacramento. Values are ideas that live separately in the minds of everyone, but collectively they form a culture that embraces multiple people, communities and generations. They are given actual form in policies and goals that build a more welcoming, tolerant, prosperous, healthy and equitable state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And they are in danger. Here’s how:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Protection of natural resources</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California could be just another uninspiring patch of dirt were it not for its stunning geography: sunny beaches, towering mountain ranges, gentle rolling hills, rugged coastlines, soaring forests, fertile inland valleys and breathtaking deserts. Most of the Golden State’s history is a tale of exploitation of this seemingly endless abundance. Gold! Timber! Open land!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only in the last half a century have California’s leaders started to rein in the predation by protecting the state’s natural resources and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet many of the leading Republican recall candidates seem to have no interest in maintaining the climate or environmental goals supported by this governor and are more inclined to seek policies that would make things worse — much worse. Several candidates have said, for example, they would seek expanded oil drilling and fracking operations, encourage more logging of forests and suspend environmental rules wholesale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are already losing much of the beauty of California and its flora and fauna to the poor choices made by decades of short-sighted leadership. If we lose much more, it may not be worth saving.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, tolerance and equality</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From its early days, California has represented a meeting and mixing of peoples, a destination for risk-takers and refugees, entrepreneurs and escapees. But it hasn’t been a bastion of tolerance and equality for most of its existence, as evidenced by the displacement of Indigenous communities, the embrace of the racist Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and ballot-box assaults on immigrant rights in 1994, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in 1996 and same-sex marriage in 2008. But over the last decade, California has evolved into a beacon of tolerance and equality that inspires the rest of the nation and, indeed, freedom-loving peoples everywhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the policies sometimes swing too far, such as when the Legislature banned travel by California state employees to states that passed anti-LGBTQ laws or when the governor bent over backward to ensure equity in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and ended up only temporarily delaying the rollout? ? Perhaps, but those are rare examples.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The efforts the state has taken under Newsom’s leadership to reverse discriminatory polices and ensure equal access — such as reforming a criminal justice system that disproportionately affects people of color and supporting the creation of a panel to examine reparations to Californians descended from enslaved people — are at risk. We fear the state’s position as a fighter against intolerance will end if Newsom is recalled, as many of the leading Republican recall candidates deny that racial discrimination and inequality even exist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Embracing democracy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Republican legislatures and governors in other U.S. states have passed laws to make it harder for citizens to vote, California has gone about as far any state to expand access to the franchise. (Colorado, which pioneered many of the voting reforms California adopted, is another.) It did this by adopting automatic registration through the Department of Motor Vehicles, same-day registration, early vote centers and generous grace periods for late ballots.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it is the misuse of the state’s generous support of citizen engagement — its direct democracy system that allows the citizens to make and repeal laws, and to remove elected officials — that has led to this threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least one of the recall candidates, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), told the Los Angeles Times editorial board he supports voter ID, which is one of the main ways that Republicans in other states have sought to suppress voting among communities of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Support for the marginalized</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California is an extravagantly wealthy state. But it’s also a land of searing inequality and entrenched poverty. Homeless encampments and shantytowns should be an eternal source of shame. Caring for the state’s inhabitants in need, regardless of their economic situation or immigration status, is one of the most fundamental of California values.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What this means in practical terms is an expansion of the safety net such as the state has done, including providing relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring sick pay for workers and pouring billions of the state’s budget surplus into programs that help and house the unsheltered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This also means continuing to reverse decades of counterproductive criminal justice efforts that have resulted in excessive sentences and crippling, unnecessary costs — on taxpayers, on communities struggling to recover from crime and on offenders who have learned their lesson and want to live responsible lives but remain stuck in prison.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom understands this. But if he is removed, would his successor? Probably not. Most of the recall candidates think the criminal justice reforms should be stopped.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do we know these are values shared by Californians? Simple. These changes did not happen organically; they were shepherded by elected officials, such as Newsom, who were supported by a majority of Californians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, what’s on the recall ballot is the most important value of all: democracy.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

It’s time to pop the bubble.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you have spent any time around conservative politics, you will have heard the inevitable grousing about liberal media bias and how much harder this makes it for Republicans to win elections. Journalists, of course, question whether this is true — though this position grows steadily less defensible, particularly when considering coverage of social issues, in which acclaim of the left-wing position is near-universal among the ""mainstream.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lately, though, I've begun doubting whether Republicans and those who agree with them are right — wondering whether media defenders shouldn't just say: Hell yes, Republicans, the media has a left-wing bias, but don't worry, that hurts Democrats more than you.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My most recent occasion for these musings was a column that Ezra Klein of the New York Times wrote about David Shor, a progressive election analyst. Shor thinks the left has a major problem with its youthful and well-educated activist base, which staffs left-leaning newsrooms and runs campaigns. They focus, naturally, on issues that excite them, and Shor told Klein ""the things that are most exciting to activists and journalists are politically toxic.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change, for example, is something that very liberal White people ""care way more about"" than anyone else, according to Shor, so when you focus on it, ""you sound like a weird, very liberal white person."" Even immigration and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have proved surprisingly unpopular with the very voters of color they were supposed to woo.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shor has his detractors, of course. Their objections might be summed up by progressive strategist Anat Shenker-Osorio's response to Klein: ""The job of a good message isn't to say what's popular but to make popular what needs to be said."" Democrats of her persuasion might prefer the framing advocated by law professor Ian Haney Lopez: ""The idea is to shift the basic political conflict in the United States from one between racial groups (the right's preferred frame) to one between the 0.1% and the rest of us, with racism as their principal weapon.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To me, Shor's vision — sort your ideas by popularity, then ""Start at the top, and work your way down to find something that excites people"" — sounds less inspiring but more likely to help Democrats get and hold power. It doesn't require Democrats to persuade voters that, say, an Asian American assistant professor has exactly the same interests as a rural, White call-center worker or a Hispanic plumber and that only a conspiracy of the very rich prevents them from realizing it. Democrats merely have to learn what voters already want.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But while Shor's more prosaic strategy might be an easier sell to voters, it is apt to be a harder sell to the young idealists who staff campaigns and newsrooms. And the newsrooms might be a bigger problem than the political class.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Matt Yglesias pointed out on Twitter, ""A closed circle of young, college educated staffers is likely to end up further off-center the more they talk to themselves."" The mainstream media, and staffers' internal fights spilling onto Twitter, are an important part of how the progressive vanguard talks to itself — and as the media skews ever-leftward, it helps sustain a rarefied bubble where divisive slogans such as ""defund the police"" can be questioned only with great delicacy, while significantly more popular propositions like ""use the military to help police quell riots"" cannot be defended at all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This inevitably affects campaign coverage, and in ways that arguably make it harder for Democrats to pivot away from divisive identity politics. Shor can insist all he wants that Hillary Clinton's campaign ought to have focused on her higher-polling economic message, but as his critics note, the media paid far more attention to Trump's problems with immigrants, women and racial minorities, leaving Clinton limited scope to set a different agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media can probably afford to live in that bubble, even if it means that the public identifies commentators and other journalists as extensions of left-wing political campaigns, rather than neutral arbiters. (Many Republicans already see the media that way, and independents may be starting to.) Outlets depend less and less on advertisers that shun controversy and more on a select group of highly educated, politically engaged subscribers who generally prefer Democrats to Republicans, and may well prefer the linguistic politics of the educated class — ""Latinx"" instead of ""Hispanic,"" or ""birthing people"" instead of ""women"" — and policies such as defunding the police over putting more cops on the street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats cannot afford to cater only to that hyper-educated class — not in a country where only a third of the population has a bachelor's degree. But if Shor is right, moving to where the voters are will require the highly engaged staffers and donors to sacrifice their own interests and commitments to political expedience. Naturally, they will look for reasons they don't have to. The danger is that a media that shares their commitments will provide those reasons, right up to the point where the left has talked itself into an electoral disaster too big for anyone to deny.</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

Just as we need to preserve the sanctity of elections (by prosecuting coup instigators), democracy defenders need to address judicial radicals' gross distortion of our system, resulting in the current Supreme Court's subversion of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unhinged from judicial standards, the court now roves through the policy landscape, overturning decades of law and reordering Americans' lives and institutions. It upends women's health, revamps college admissions, snatches student aid from millions and redefines public accommodations (allowing egregious discrimination). In aggrandizing power, the court illegitimately dominates policymaking, undermining democracy to an extent we have not seen in nearly 100 years. (Ronald Brownstein pointed out that similar constitutional collisions in the 1850s and 1930s took a civil war or threat of court-packing to resolve.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something must change if we want to preserve rule by the people's elected leaders responsible to voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a preliminary matter, it is essential to identify the problem. As morally and politically offensive as Supreme Court decisions on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, LGBTQ+ discrimination and student debt forgiveness might be to millions of Americans, merely criticizing the court's result is misguided and unproductive. The task is to expose the court's disintegration as a legitimate judicial body and note its emergence as a supreme right-wing policymaker. When the court operates on an ends-justify-the-means basis, shreds legal doctrine and dishonestly presents the facts, critics should not play whack-a-mole, decrying each individual rejection of widespread American values. In doing so, the court negates self-government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telltale sign that the justices have become partisan politicians: their refusal to adopt mandatory ethics rules, which destroys the essence of judicial impartiality that is the root of their legitimacy. When judges cease to eliminate conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, they appear indistinguishable from politicians wined and dined in rarefied settings by lobbyists. The stench of financial corruption, coupled with justices' intemperate rants in partisan settings and in op-eds, convinces Americans that the justices are partisan players out to score points for their own side.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, the court strays out of its constitutional lane when it refuses to follow consistent rules of construction and honestly address cases' facts. When, for example, the majority casts aside stare decisis (as in the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> case) without admitting it or refuses to apply the test for departing from precedent (as in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization), it is simply muscling its way to desired outcomes because it has the votes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worse, cases are now manufactured to create policy. The majority has made complete hash out of standing and concepts such as ""case and controversy"" to reach decisions it had no business deciding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the student loan debt relief case, the court created standing out of whole cloth. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, ""The requirement that the proper party — the party actually affected — challenge an action ensures that courts do not overstep their proper bounds. … Without that requirement, courts become 'forums for the ventilation of public grievances' — for settlement of ideological and political disputes."" Here the court deliberately ignored that the aggrieved party was not a litigant. Likewise, in the case of a web designer worried about selling her services to a gay couple (who appear to be fabricated), the court defied every principle of standing. When the court goes beyond actual cases and controversies to answer hypotheticals, it goes beyond its constitutional mandate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, worst of all, the newfangled ""major questions doctrine"" allows the court to subjectively decide when the issue is of ""major political salience"" (whatever the court says it is); if so, the court demands the application at issue be specifically authorized by statute (a standard lawmakers somehow never meet in this court's eyes). It has become a crutch whenever the court seeks to invalidate a program it doesn't like. In the student debt relief case, the court reached the desired result by ignoring the word ""waive"" in the statute authorizing loan forgiveness to reach the finding that Congress hadn't delegated power to, well, waive student debt. ""[T]he Court once again substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch — and the hundreds of millions of people they represent — in making this Nation's most important, as well as most contested, policy decisions,"" Kagan wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mumbo-jumbo ""major questions doctrine"" is not the stuff of judging. No wonder the chief justice got touchy when Kagan pointed out that the court ""is supposed to stick to its business — to decide only cases and controversies and to stay away from making this Nation's policy about subjects like student-loan relief."" What the Slaughter-House Cases and substantive due process were to the New Deal-era right-wing court, the ""major questions doctrine"" is to the current court: a smokescreen for enforcing a right-wing agenda (or vetoing a progressive one).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In departing from the authentic judicial review, the right-wing majority unsurprisingly produces results perfectly aligned with the right's agenda on hot-button topics. (By the law of averages, its ""analysis"" should occasionally favor the other side.) When foretelling a case's outcome or following the majority's ""reasoning"" requires a crib sheet on GOP political aims, something is wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And voters have figured out what's going on. According to an ABC News-Ipsos poll, 53 percent ""believe that the nation's highest court rules mainly on the basis of their partisan political view rather than on the basis of the law (33%), while 14% say they don't know."" Before the Dobbs opinion, a separate January 2022 poll showed that ""38% of Americans believed that the justices rule mainly on the basis of law, versus 43% who believed that the court rules on the basis of their political views.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The transformation of the court into a partisan player contradicts the central premise of democracy. We should reject the obtuse and naive argument that this court isn't so bad because it didn't entirely obliterate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and declined to impose the outrageous independent state legislature doctrine. Now is no time for self-delusion. Ending the right-wing majority's intolerable war on self-government will require that the other two branches and the voters cut the court down to size. A single election or a single reform might not suffice. Cogent law review articles, informed public debate and exquisite dissents revealing that the right-wing judicial emperors have no clothes can assist reformers. Term limits, jurisdiction stripping, court expansion and ethics reform should be on the table. Simply put, if we want democracy to survive, each election must be a referendum on the court's legitimacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On this Independence Day, which celebrates rebellion against a monarch lacking consent of the governed, it behooves us to dedicate ourselves to robust and authentic democracy — government of the people, by the people, for the people — not by arrogant right-wing justices.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

Gavin Newsom, we have said that California’s values are at stake as well. The leading Republican candidates, particularly front-runner Larry Elder, don’t support the values most Californians hold dear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And what are those values? There’s no official definition cast in bronze at the state Capitol in Sacramento. Values are ideas that live separately in the minds of everyone, but collectively they form a culture that embraces multiple people, communities and generations. They are given actual form in policies and goals that build a more welcoming, tolerant, prosperous, healthy and equitable state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And they are in danger. Here’s how:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Protection of natural resources</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California could be just another uninspiring patch of dirt were it not for its stunning geography: sunny beaches, towering mountain ranges, gentle rolling hills, rugged coastlines, soaring forests, fertile inland valleys and breathtaking deserts. Most of the Golden State’s history is a tale of exploitation of this seemingly endless abundance. Gold! Timber! Open land!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only in the last half a century have California’s leaders started to rein in the predation by protecting the state’s natural resources and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet many of the leading Republican recall candidates seem to have no interest in maintaining the climate or environmental goals supported by this governor and are more inclined to seek policies that would make things worse — much worse. Several candidates have said, for example, they would seek expanded oil drilling and fracking operations, encourage more logging of forests and suspend environmental rules wholesale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are already losing much of the beauty of California and its flora and fauna to the poor choices made by decades of short-sighted leadership. If we lose much more, it may not be worth saving.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, tolerance and equality</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From its early days, California has represented a meeting and mixing of peoples, a destination for risk-takers and refugees, entrepreneurs and escapees. But it hasn’t been a bastion of tolerance and equality for most of its existence, as evidenced by the displacement of Indigenous communities, the embrace of the racist Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and ballot-box assaults on immigrant rights in 1994, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in 1996 and same-sex marriage in 2008. But over the last decade, California has evolved into a beacon of tolerance and equality that inspires the rest of the nation and, indeed, freedom-loving peoples everywhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the policies sometimes swing too far, such as when the Legislature banned travel by California state employees to states that passed anti-LGBTQ laws or when the governor bent over backward to ensure equity in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and ended up only temporarily delaying the rollout? ? Perhaps, but those are rare examples.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The efforts the state has taken under Newsom’s leadership to reverse discriminatory polices and ensure equal access — such as reforming a criminal justice system that disproportionately affects people of color and supporting the creation of a panel to examine reparations to Californians descended from enslaved people — are at risk. We fear the state’s position as a fighter against intolerance will end if Newsom is recalled, as many of the leading Republican recall candidates deny that racial discrimination and inequality even exist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Embracing democracy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Republican legislatures and governors in other U.S. states have passed laws to make it harder for citizens to vote, California has gone about as far any state to expand access to the franchise. (Colorado, which pioneered many of the voting reforms California adopted, is another.) It did this by adopting automatic registration through the Department of Motor Vehicles, same-day registration, early vote centers and generous grace periods for late ballots.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it is the misuse of the state’s generous support of citizen engagement — its direct democracy system that allows the citizens to make and repeal laws, and to remove elected officials — that has led to this threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least one of the recall candidates, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), told the Los Angeles Times editorial board he supports voter ID, which is one of the main ways that Republicans in other states have sought to suppress voting among communities of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Support for the marginalized</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California is an extravagantly wealthy state. But it’s also a land of searing inequality and entrenched poverty. Homeless encampments and shantytowns should be an eternal source of shame. Caring for the state’s inhabitants in need, regardless of their economic situation or immigration status, is one of the most fundamental of California values.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What this means in practical terms is an expansion of the safety net such as the state has done, including providing relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring sick pay for workers and pouring billions of the state’s budget surplus into programs that help and house the unsheltered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This also means continuing to reverse decades of counterproductive criminal justice efforts that have resulted in excessive sentences and crippling, unnecessary costs — on taxpayers, on communities struggling to recover from crime and on offenders who have learned their lesson and want to live responsible lives but remain stuck in prison.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom understands this. But if he is removed, would his successor? Probably not. Most of the recall candidates think the criminal justice reforms should be stopped.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do we know these are values shared by Californians? Simple. These changes did not happen organically; they were shepherded by elected officials, such as Newsom, who were supported by a majority of Californians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, what’s on the recall ballot is the most important value of all: democracy.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

The searing news of the disproportionate rates of COVID-19 among Black Americans has added to the urgency of this moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But not for Donald Trump. His long record of embracing racism as a political tool -- from his promotion of the ""birther"" lie about Barack Obama to his defense of white supremacists -- has made him the most racially polarizing president in the last century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet while many Republican ""Never Trumpers"" condemn Trump for his brazen appeals to white supremacy, they are curiously silent on Ronald Reagan's record on race and civil rights. It's no accident that the Party of Reagan morphed so easily into the Party of Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long before Trump descended his golden escalator, promising to ""Make America Great Again,"" Reagan was the first to use the slogan ""Let's Make America Great Again,"" vowing to return America to its past glory before the civil rights movement toppled Jim Crow in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whenever the issue of Reagan's hostility to civil rights and unpopularity with Black Americans is broached, conservatives leap to Reagan's defense and stress his apparent lack of personal racism. That view has been shredded by the disclosure last year of a phone call in October 1971 between Richard Nixon and Reagan, in which Reagan described African diplomats as ""monkeys"" who were still ""uncomfortable wearing their shoes.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan's sunny vision of America as a ""shining city"" may be the antithesis of Donald Trump's dystopian American ""carnage,"" he masterfully deployed racially coded language and other dog whistles like ""states' rights,"" ""law and order"" and ""welfare queens"" that resonated with middle-class taxpayers without appearing racist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telling illustration is Reagan's decision to give a major speech in his 1980 campaign at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., only miles from where three civil rights workers -- James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner -- were murdered in 1964. Looking back, it is eerily similar to Trump's decision to hold a campaign rally on the day after Juneteenth in Tulsa, Okla., the site of the worst racial massacre in the 20th century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan was the first presidential nominee of a major political party to attend that fair since it started in 1889, and that fact was not lost on the 20,000 white people gathered there on Aug. 3, 1980, many proudly waving Confederate flags and chanting, ""We want Reagan! We want Reagan!"" The crowd was exhilarated with his declaring his fidelity to states' rights, which for a century had been the South's rallying cry to prevent the federal government from interfering with its racial customs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That speech helped Reagan sweep every Southern state except President Carter's home state of Georgia. Since then, the Old Confederacy has been the heart of the GOP. On the eve of Reagan's inauguration, Black Americans feared an assault on the civil rights gains of the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These fears were well-founded. After all, Reagan began his political career with his 1966 campaign for California governor by denouncing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, while running radio ads referring to urban areas as ""jungles.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only months after the Watts riots, Reagan made ""law and order"" and opposition to California's far-reaching Fair Housing Act the centerpiece of his campaign to oust the liberal incumbent, Pat Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan repeatedly said, ""If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes in the sale or renting of his property, it is his right to do so."" This stance resonated with millions of middle-class white voters, many of whom had never voted for a Republican, but voted for Reagan in part because they feared African Americans moving into their neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan's success in making inroads with white working-class voters in the booming suburbs of Southern California was a template for the ""law and order"" and ""silent majority"" rhetoric that fueled Nixon's presidential victory in 1968. Reagan mounted an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination in 1968, in which he crisscrossed the South and white enclaves across the country thrilling conservative audiences with his scorching attacks on lawless civil rights agitators and his tough talk of law and order. Just hours after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, Reagan called King's assassination ""a great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order and people started choosing which laws they'd break.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1976, Reagan, in challenging Gerald Ford for the Republican presidential nomination, popularized the racist trope of a ""welfare queen,"" repeating at virtually every campaign stop, before white audiences, the fictitious story of a Black welfare cheat, subsidized by hardworking white taxpayers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, Reagan's two-term presidency marked a new nadir in race relations. His administration tried to dilute the Voting Rights Act, vitiated the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and vowed to abolish <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, arguing that white men were the only victims -- of reverse discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan's attitudes on civil rights were reflected in his refusal to impose sanctions on the apartheid government of South Africa; he vetoed a 1986 bill imposing sanctions, which Congress overrode. Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu was so incensed that he declared Reagan ""a racist, pure and simple.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most egregiously, Reagan was instrumental in ratcheting up the ""war on drugs,"" which has led to the mass incarceration of Black and poor people of color and the destruction of families and communities. His administration adopted a series of draconian laws that resulted in the imprisonment rate of African Americans on drug charges that is almost six times that of whites, even though whites use illicit drugs at a similar rate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan eschewed the overt racism of Trump, his racial politics paved the way for Trump. In fact, Reagan's brand of racism was perhaps more sinister than Trump's because he did it with a genial smile. In reckoning with Trump, we need to reckon with Reagan's legacy. And that began with his appeal to white voters in Southern California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: RONALD REAGAN, at the 1976 GOP National Convention, repeatedly used the trope of the Black ""welfare queen"" to appeal to white voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:David Hume Kennerly Getty Images</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Daniel S.

Never mind that a majority of Texans like being American citizens; these freedom-fighters aren't big on the fine print of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over three decades, the HRA bombs bars in Austin and Houston, killing about 500 civilians, including (accidents will happen) scores of Mexican immigrants. Its members murder state and federal judges, and any fellow Latinos caught ""collaborating"" with Texas state troopers, including caterers and garbage men. They assassinate over 300 policemen. When Washington activates the National Guard to keep the peace, 700 American servicemen wind up in boxes. And while most decent, hard-working Latinos in Texas don't support the HRA, they also don't mind all the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> coming their way since the ruckus started.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Airport novels must constantly raise the stakes, so we can't have the HRA constraining itself to Texas. Equipped by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, the HRA bombs Wall Street, causing billions of dollars in damage. In fact, the World Trade Center bombing of 1992 could easily be the work of these militants. They mortar-bomb the White House, and make unnervingly near-successful assassination attempts on both Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is the American public enraged? Quite the opposite: It's bored. Another bombing in El Paso? Big deal. Texas seems far away, and a thorn in the side. Maybe it would be a relief to shed the place, which doesn't even generate much oil revenue anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here the plot may take a turn toward the far-fetched: The sitting U.S. president -- let's call him Bartlet -- initiates a ""peace process."" Laborious negotiations ensue involving the federal government, the Texas chapters of the Democratic and Republican parties, a political front for the HRA, and Mexico. (As to why the U.S. would negotiate with a foreign country over a state in the union, just suspend your disbelief.) Charitably, the HRA offers to refrains from blowing up bars or assassinating presidents. At last they hammer out a deal, to international celebration. No more carnage!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not the end of the story, because ""peace"" doesn't come cheap. Texas is still a star in Old Glory, but the American flag is put out of view in public places lest it alienate Hispanics. A complex bureaucratic apparatus now links Austin and Mexico City to coordinate social policy. President Bartlet doesn't dare sneeze in Texas without asking the Mexican president's permission, and all statements in relation to the Lone Star state are issued jointly with the Mexican government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It gets weirder: Every HRA sniper and bomber that the FBI apprehended gets to go home, though many have just started life sentences. Picture a swarthier Timothy McVeigh -- who in our page-turner walks off death row a free man, met by a cheering crowd and a pitcher of margarita. The Texas state police force, which did so much to keep the HRA from killing even more people than it did, is drastically downsized and renamed. Made to feel ashamed, droves of experienced anti-terrorist officers retire early. A powerful police ombudsman is imported from Mexico, as is an ""oversight commissioner"" from France. Americans can no longer be trusted to run their own police.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most painfully, HRA leaders are ushered into Texas state government, and a self-confessed HRA commander is awarded the post of commissioner of education. The Texas governor says he can tolerate working with murderers on only one condition: The HRA must destroy at least some of its 100-ton illegal arsenal, which it has kept for a rainy day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, does Mr. Bartlet get tough? No, the president of the U.S. grovels. With no promises from the HRA on disarmament (its representatives have proposed how they might theoretically disarm, but not when), he promises to withdraw the National Guard from Texas and to dismantle its outposts. He announces an amnesty for HRA men on the lam, giving about 60 desperadoes a clean record. He promises the secessionist leadership that convicted felons can infiltrate the Texas police force, and serve on its supervisory board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this happens even though a new dissident group is bombing D.C. again. (The ""Real"" HRA comprises disaffected HRA members who still think -- and you can see why, with such an accommodating federal government -- that they can win Texas by force.) Mr. Bartlet dangles the possibility of disbanding the FBI's Domestic Counter-Terrorism Program, which HRA people despise because it's been so effective at catching them red-handed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You seem skeptical. Let killers out of jail, having served only one or two years? Not in the U.S. of A! Convicted murderers in the police, supervising police operations? As if! Decisions on the National Guard and FBI made solely on the basis of demands by a bunch of unelected terrorists? A ridiculous book! It'll never sell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Your mistake. It has sold -- foreign rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>British Prime Minister Tony Blair uses the fact that mainland Britons (and Americans) are bored and confused by Northern Ireland. Awkward formulations like ""putting arms beyond use"" -- in deference to terrorists' delicate sensibilities -- and lofty calls for peace disguise the fact that he is selling out his law-abiding countrymen for the sake of short-term expedience. The details of the latest shenanigans -- London's suspension of Belfast's assembly and its resumption 24 hours later, the equally theatrical submission and retraction of a vague IRA ""offer"" to disarm -- are unimportant, though their bureaucratic and rhetorical complexity, for both parties, is usefully obfuscating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I cling to the conviction that no U.S. president would make major decisions about American security in accordance with the wishes of people like McVeigh. It's unimaginable that Americans would tolerate a commander-in-chief who installed unrepentant terrorists in executive positions of a state government, invited convicted murderers to join and oversee a virtually dismantled state police force, and released wholesale into the community felons after risibly short sentences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oklahoma City aside, Americans have been lucky with respect to domestic terrorism. As it becomes easier technologically for small groups to cause mass casualties, that luck may not hold. If we ever are subjected to such a movement within our borders, we are likely to look to places like Northern Ireland for solutions, only to discover that the British government has prostrated itself before killers, lavishing a terrorist movement with every political gratuity it can think of -- throwing pearls before swine. Ulster sets a disturbing precedent. To avoid abridging the most fundamental democratic principles, we may be forced to turn elsewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Shriver is a London-based American novelist and journalist who lived for 12 years in Belfast.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: Letters to the Editor: The `Void' in the British System"" -- WSJ Sept. 5, 2001)</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

And as news it's not in the same league as the total war waged against Harvard president Lawrence Summers for having had the temerity to suggest that factors in addition to prejudice might have something to do with the under-representation of women in math and the sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, what happened at Purdue is a pungent reminder of all that's possible now in the rarefied ideological atmosphere on our college campuses -- and in this presidential election year, not perhaps only on our campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story began prosaically enough. Keith Sampson, a student employee on the janitorial staff earning his way toward a degree, was in the habit of reading during work breaks. Last October he was immersed in ""Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson was in short order visited by his union representative, who informed him he must not bring this book to the break room, and that he could be fired. Taking the book to the campus, Mr. Sampson says he was told, was ""like bringing pornography to work."" That it was a history of the battle students waged against the Klan in the 1920s in no way impressed the union rep.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The assistant <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer who next summoned the student was similarly unimpressed. Indeed she was, Mr. Sampson says, irate at his explanation that he was, after all, reading a scholarly book. ""The Klan still rules Indiana,"" Marguerite Watkins told him -- didn't he know that? Mr. Sampson, by now dazed, pointed out that this book was carried in the university library. Yes, she retorted, you can get Klan propaganda in the library.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university has allowed no interviews with Ms. Watkins or any other university official involved in the case. Still, there can be no disputing the contents of the official letter that set forth the university's case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson stood accused of ""openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your Black co-workers."" The statement, signed by chief <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer Lillian Charleston, asserted that her office had completed its investigation of the charges brought by Ms. Nakea William, his co- worker -- that Mr. Sampson had continued, despite complaints, to read a book on this ""inflammatory topic."" ""We conclude,"" the letter informed him, ""that your conduct constitutes racial harassment. . . ."" A very serious matter, with serious consequences, it went on to point out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was in November. Months later, in February of this year, Mr. Sampson received -- from the same source -- a letter with an astonishingly transformed version of his offense. And there could be no mystery as to the cause of this change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the official judgment against him, Mr. Sampson turned to Indiana state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, whose office contacted university attorneys. Worse, the case got some sharp local press coverage that threatened to get wider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ludicrous harassment cases are not rare at our institutions of higher learning. But there was undeniably something special -- something pure, and glorious -- in the clarity of this picture. A university had brought a case against a student on grounds of a book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so the new letter to Mr. Sampson by <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer Charleston brought word that she wished to clarify her previous letter, and to say it was ""permissible for him to read scholarly books or other materials on break time."" About the essential and only theme of the first letter -- the ""racially abhorrent"" subject of the book -- or the warnings that any ""future substantiated conduct of a similar nature could mean serious disciplinary action"" -- there was not a word. She had meant in that first letter, she said, only to address ""conduct"" that caused concern among his co-workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What that conduct was, the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> officer did not reveal -- but she had delivered the message rewriting the history of the case. Absolutely and for certain there had been no problem about any book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This, indeed, was now the official story -- as any journalist asking about the case would learn instantly from the university's media relations representatives. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved -- if not much -- by the extraordinary efforts of these tormented agents trying to explain that the first letter was all wrong: No reading of any book had anything to do with the charges against Mr. Sampson. This means, I asked one, that Mr. Sampson could have been reading about the adventures of Jack and Jill and he still would have been charged? Yes. What, then, was the offense? ""Harassing behavior."" While reading the book? The question led to careful explanations hopeless in tone -- for good reason -- and well removed from all semblance of reason. What the behavior was, one learned, could never be revealed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was, of course, no other offensive behavior; had there been any it would surely have appeared in the first letter's gusher of accusation. Like those prosecutors who invent new charges when the first ones fail in court, the administrators threw in the mysterious harassment count. Such were the operations of the university's guardians of equity and justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In April -- having been pressed by the potent national watchdog group FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) as well as the ACLU -- University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz finally sent them a letter expressing regret over this affair, and testifying to his profound commitment to freedom of expression. So far as can be ascertained, the university has extended no such expressions of regret to Keith Sampson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This case and all its kind are worth bearing in mind for anyone pondering the hypersensitivity surrounding the issue of race today. The mindset that produces those harassment courts, those super-heated capacities for perceiving insult, is not limited to college campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its presence is evident in this election campaign, which has seen more than a touch of readiness to impute some form of racism to all tough criticisms of Barack Obama. The deranged response that greeted Bill Clinton's remark that certain of Sen. Obama's claims were ""a fairy tale,"" told the story. No need to go into the now famous catalogue of accusations about the Clintons' ""sly racist"" tactics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There will be much more ahead, directed to the Republicans and their candidate. Some more, no doubt, about the Willie Horton ad of 1988, whose status as a quintessential piece of racism is -- except for a few rare voices of reason -- accepted throughout our media as revealed truth. To be sure, the Willie Horton charge has for some time been over-shadowed by ominous predictions of all the Swiftboating Republicans are supposed to be readying.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Obama himself, the candidate of racial transcendence, has now taken a plunge of sorts to old-style race politics. In a preemptive dismissal of future criticism, he warned a Florida audience on June 20, of the racist tactics the Republicans planned. ""We know the strategy,"" he said. Republicans planned to make people afraid of him. They'd say ""he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this may be far from the world of the universities. But to those aforementioned campus ideologues, the thinking is familiar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Correction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yesterday's op-ed article by Dorothy Rabinowitz, ""American Politics Aren't 'Post-Racial',"" misstated the name of the university.

None of that sheds any light on the most important political questions facing the nation: How will Al Gore or George W. Bush govern, once in the White House, and who will follow the winner to the center of power?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Knowing whom a President Gore or a President Bush would hire to help run the federal government ought to be high up in the minds of voters in November. After all, in addition to the president himself, the Cabinet and sub-Cabinet members, White House advisers, thousands of presidential appointees, Schedule C employees, and personal and confidential assistants scattered throughout the federal establishment will directly shape administration priorities and influence the national policy for the next four years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, with the exceptions of Gen. Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, who have been prominently mentioned as Bush's secretary of State and national security adviser respectively, voters are clueless as to who would be on George W. Bush's A-team next year. The same goes for Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters deserve to know who is to be entrusted with the machinery of government. And they should know before Election Day, not after the votes are counted, while the champagne is flowing and when names start cropping up in the news. By then, it's too late to do anything about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are good reasons for demanding that both candidates come clean sooner rather than later.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bush, for instance, staged images of inclusion in Philadelphia and produced a platform that said, ""To all Americans, particularly immigrants and minorities, we send a clear message: This is the party of freedom and progress, and it is your home."" George W. Bush now has a chance to go one step further by revealing to America what his administration would look like.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Would the people selected to help him wield power reflect the hard- right political orientation of the overwhelmingly white conventioneers who were kept offstage at the First Union Center in Philly? Or would he craft an administration that reflects the diversity his party touted in prime time and in its platform?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican standard-bearer can spend the rest of the campaign hugging black children, addressing Latino rallies in fluent Spanish and pledging help to Native Americans. But a Bush governing team that fails to look like the America he professes to embrace would confirm the Democratic charge that the GOP convention was only an illusion of inclusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Waiting until Inauguration Day to find out what Bush has in mind is a gamble. Voters need to know now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Al Gore has no less a burden. A major role reversal has occurred within the Democratic Party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Writing about the Democratic convention in the Aug. 28 New Republic, Franklin Foer correctly observed: ""Liberal lions like Jackson and [Ted] Kennedy may know how to give speeches that energize the base, but the action in the Democratic Party is well to their right, with the Democratic Leadership Council . . . and other hard- core centrists. And the centrists know it; throughout the convention, their triumphalism is palpable.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Rev. Jesse Jackson partially conceded the shift during a meeting with The Post's editorial board this week. He agreed that the privately run Democratic Leadership Council has gained firm control of the top of the Democratic presidential ticket through its chairman, Sen. Joe Lieberman, and its member, Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Jackson said the council's membership does not reflect the racial or political orientation of delegates at the Los Angeles convention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That may not matter. As Will Marshall, president of the council's think tank, the Progressive Policy Institute, boasted in the New Republic piece: ""We used to be outside taking shots [at them]. Now we're enthroned and they're constantly attacking us.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does that mean the center-right-oriented council would have greater influence over the naming of Cabinet members and other top- level positions in a Gore administration? Not an insignificant question.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most African Americans and many other voters of color are expected to go with Gore because of Bill Clinton's record on jobs, his support for civil rights and his appointment of the most diverse administration in this country's history. But now that Gore is his ""own man,"" voters may want to know if the Democratic Leadership Council's ascendancy will mean a rollback in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> or backsliding on Democratic policies aimed at strengthening cities and rural communities and closing the achievement gap in schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candidate Gore can answer their worries by putting on public view- -before Nov. 7--the key women and men with whom he plans to govern.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That said, it would be wrong to conclude that this column's push for early disclosure is only about race and diversity. It's more than that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We're in a new day. Voters are better informed; they want and need to know more. Why shouldn't they know, in advance, who would be on the next president's foreign policy team? Why can't they be in a position to judge--before they vote--the credentials and competence of the individuals who, for example, would be selected to oversee health care policy and food and drug laws, manage environmental protection, carry the burden of federal law-enforcement responsibilities and steer the executive branch through the federal budget process?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both camps will tell you that's what a presidential transition is for--that they have to develop a blueprint, recruit, vet, make people fill out forms, and meet with interest groups, etc. from November to January.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Never mind that Tony Blair and his cabinet ministers took office in England one day after his election--a 24-hour transition. Or that presidential transitions take a week in France.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Okay, I'll concede this much: The next president can't unveil his entire administration by November. But why not disclose his future cabinet by mid-October?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sure, it would spoil the fun of watching the months-long intense jockeying of wannabes seeking top jobs in the next administration. And yes, it would stop Gore and Bush, two political pros, from teasing and extracting support from the ambitious and the aspiring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I think it's time for Bush and Gore to stop showing voters a little leg; it's time for both men to show their hand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e-mail: kingc@washpost.com</p></div>"	stance:::Neutral

62dea723c6db0370fd6c8229	aa_opeds_sample/txt/423943644.xml.txt	"<div><p>BEHIND THE MIAMI RIOT; by David Whitman</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the aftermath of the Miami riot, black leaders and liberal politicians have advanced with renewed vigor the thesis that race riots result from racial discrimination. This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim,  county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held  by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason. The whole community has paid a terrible price.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies of the 1966-69 riots indicate that rioters are especially vulnerable  to feelings of ''relative deprivation'' -that is, they are most likely to resort to violence when they see the conditions of those around them (often other blacks) improving. While many blacks benefited from the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, the mass of blacks in the ghettos remains unaffected, and city after city erupted in racial violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1980, these conditions exist once again. Over the last 15 years, a class gap between the haves and have-nots has been slowly widening in most urban black communities. While the black middle class has doubled during that time (to between 35 percent and 45 percent of the American black population of 25.8 million), the size of the black lower class has barely diminished, and the proportion of workingclass blacks in menial service jobs may have actually increased. For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent. (The rest of the black work force is in higher-paying blue-collar jobs, and there is a minute percentage in farm work.)  Dillusionment among poor blacks in Miami is also heightened by the fact that bilingual and lighter-skinned Cubans have taken many of the jobs that traditionally have provided openings for blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dramatic growth of the American black middle class has resulted largely from a wholesale decline of racial discrimination in the labor market since the  1964 Civil Rights Act, but, unfortunately, this decline has not benefited disadvantaged blacks who lack the opportunity to attend college and compete for  corporate and government jobs. These blacks, in urban cores, must seek workingclass jobs that pay a living wage. Unfortunately, desirable bluecollar jobs in craft work and manufacturing are increasingly rare in central cities. Trends in the economy, such as automation and the suburbanization of industrial  production, mean that poor blacks, especially young, uneducated ones, spend most of their time competing for dead-end service jobs such as janitorial work.  These trends remain unaffected by strategies to fight discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our most conspicuous such strategy is <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and, indeed, already we are hearing that the answer to the Miami riot is to invigorate <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs. However well-intentioned such responses may be, undoubtedly they will have a perverse effect on race relations. By using race-conscious criteria, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> creates a divisive backlash among ethnic groups and workingclass whites. In addition, such programs also widen the class gap in the black community by helping a small portion of the community to  attend college, graduate school, and compete for desirable jobs, while the most  disadvantaged segments of the black community remain essentially untouched. What poor blacks need, at a minimum, is programs that are drected toward them: programs that will ensure full employment, increase teen-age employment opportunities, and meaningfully reform the welfare system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regrettably, these programs, or what is left of them, are being slashed from  the Federal budget. In the absence of these modest efforts, we cannot expect any significant improvement in the lot of poor blacks, regardless of strenuous efforts to combat discrimination. If the Congress and President Carter insist on cutting these programs to provide increased defense spending, then we must also face the perilous prospect that our cities will remain racial tinderboxes.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- David Whitman is a senior research assistant at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

My own flesh and blood calling for an end to a program I advocated when I was about his age. When I enrolled at UC Berkeley, there were only a handful of minorities at the prestigious campus.

I paused, and reconsidered my knee-jerk defense of the program voters had already eliminated. I realized Miguel was right on one score: It would be unfair for him to get a break for his race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miguel had the background and benefits he needed to succeed on his own. Both his parents are UC graduates and bilingual. His public school ranked in the nation's top 100 academically. And he wanted for nothing at home. He had his own room with his own computer and even a loft with a spiral staircase.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hardly a hard-luck case. Clearly, if he didn't make the grade, he'd have only himself to blame. Still, I couldn't agree with his conclusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why kill a program designed to compensate for social disadvantages just because you don't suffer any?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about his less privileged peers? The students from poor areas who have to work to survive. Who sleep on couches and study in closets because their homes are so crowded. Whose parents don't speak English and don't have even high school diplomas. Whose schools are short on textbooks and good teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> once pried open opportunities in an era when politicians stood in schoolhouse doors to keep minorities out. The goal was to integrate institutions that helped perpetuate racial disparities outside their ivy-covered walls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, disparities are still stark, but we can be more selective. We can target students who really need help. Just consider the list of high schools that send the most and the fewest students to UC.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, admission and affluence are correlated. Just as race and affluence are. Communities at the top of the admissions list: Palos Verdes, Irvine, Palo Alto. Those near the bottom: Santa Ana, Compton and East San Jose, where I grew up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These underrepresented areas will be the ones to benefit most under the new plan that broadens UC eligibility to all students who rank in the top 4% of their high schools. The modest plan doesn't guarantee they'll be admitted. It simply helps identify rural and inner-city students in junior year who should be aspiring to UC, says Manuel Gomez, a UC Irvine vice chancellor and my old college friend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university already knows an extra push can make the difference in a district like Santa Ana, which is only 3% white. A UC Irvine outreach program this year helped 23 Valley High School students boost their SAT scores by an average of almost 100 points, including one kid who soared 270 points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The students paid $35 for the Kaplan Review, a $700 prep course.

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>	stance:::Neutral

Now he must confront Bill Clinton in the most inhospitable debate forum for fisticuffs -- a town-hall meeting where he'll be surrounded by 120 ''real people.'' And he must do so on a night less than three weeks before Election Day in a year when the debates thus far have failed to draw audiences anywhere near as large as those of '92.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How did Mr. Dole paint himself into this corner? Conventional wisdom blames the press for intimidating him into silence until now by threatening to shout ''Hatchet man!'' the moment he ''goes negative.'' But raising serious questions about Clinton Administration ethics, phrased precisely and respectfully, is not the same as railing about ''Democrat wars'' or crying ''Liberal!'' or invoking Paula Jones. The obvious questions Mr. Dole might ask tonight -- whether about the rifling of F.B.I. files, potential pardons for the McDougals or an influence-seeking Indonesian campaign contributor -- have been aired daily by the press itself. If Mr. Dole had articulately raised some of them weeks ago, he wouldn't so easily fit the Clinton/Gore playbook's current description of him as ''desperate.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By being so indecisive about how to act on the Clinton character issue, Mr. Dole has not only given the President a free pass, he has dramatized a big character issue of his own. Mr. Dole's habit of equivocating and reversing himself has been a damaging pattern of his candidacy from the start on a variety of fronts, not just on the matter of challenging White House ethics. He's visibly wavered so often that his leadership capabilities are as much in doubt as who hired Craig Livingstone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the primaries, Mr. Dole waffled about how to go after Pat Buchanan's extremist views much as he has waffled about challenging Mr. Clinton, refusing even to criticize Mr. Buchanan for his anti-Semitic rhetoric. When Mr. Dole's campaign officials made the embarrassing gaffe of returning a $1,000 contribution from the gay Log Cabin Republicans, the candidate dawdled for months before finally chastising his own errant staff. On abortion, he has quickly retreated under fire on nearly every stand he has taken this year, including his ''not negotiable'' call for a tolerance plank in the G.O.P. platform. Most self-destructively of all, Mr. Dole abruptly reversed his career-long stands in favor of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and against supply-side economics to prove himself, as he put it, ''another Ronald Reagan, if that's what you want.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This recent history helps explain why so many Americans don't regard Mr. Dole as a leader, but as a split-the-difference Beltway legislative mechanic. If he can't stand up to fellow Republicans, not to mention his Democratic opponent, how will he stand up to a Saddam Hussein? If he can't command his own campaign, how can he run the country? Even his own conservative allies now raise the Dole character issue -- as typified by last week's Charles Kraut hammer column faulting Mr. Dole for lacking the ''political courage'' to match his ''physical courage'' of 50 years ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Dole's character failings hardly cancel out his opponent's, but they are devastating to his hopes of presenting himself as a plausible Presidential alternative. His equivocations, reversals and avoidance of confrontations fuel the polls in which voters doubt he is tough enough to push through a 15 percent tax cut and balance the budget at the same time. Dole admirers, by contrast, point out how appealing it is to find a politician who honestly expresses his ambivalence in public rather than sticking to a phony, robotic script. That's true enough. But while Hamlets can be appealing, their chances of inheriting the White House are by definition no more likely than their ascent to the Danish throne.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

Critics, of whom there are many, call it an overpriced indulgence for the affluent few who do not have to worry about earning a living upon graduation. Fewer and fewer of today's undergraduates are pursuing the liberal arts, with most of them studying practical subjects like finance, marketing, real estate and pharmacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But James O. Freedman, 67, the retired president of Dartmouth, remains more committed than ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Liberal education opens our eyes to what life is principally about,'' he said. ''It's about understanding yourself and having some resources to deal with everything life throws at you. It's about developing a moral compass and some understanding of how society works, how democracies work.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At home in Cambridge, with his new book, ''Liberal Education and the Public Interest'' (University of Iowa Press, 2003), an ode to the value of liberal education, on the coffee table in front of him, Mr. Freedman makes his case with passion. Contrary to what critics might say, when it comes to getting a job in today's economy, Mr. Freedman says a liberal education is an important advantage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''A liberal education is what teaches people how to write and how to think and makes them much more valuable in the job market over a 40-year career than graduates of a preprofessional program,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''All the employers will tell you that they're seeking the flexibility of mind that a liberal education imbues.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His book came out in January, as he was battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system. The chemotherapy he has been undergoing since September is working.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the fall, with a tumor pressing against the nerves of his lower back, he was using a wheelchair. Now, he needs only a cane to navigate the stairs of the Victorian home he shares with his wife, Sheba.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is Mr. Freedman's fourth bout with cancer since 1994, and just as he writes in his book that a liberal education enables us to see life more clearly, so has he looked clearly at his illness. The odds are that it will return again in a year, he says, and while he hopes to watch his three small grandchildren grow up, he says, there is no way of knowing just how many years he has.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is focusing, as ever, on writing, and speaking out for the liberal values that he has spent his lifetime working for and that he now sees eroding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Life is what we are doing now,'' he writes in his book, reflecting upon the importance of an early commitment to the values of liberal arts, equal education, idealism and public service.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his desk upstairs are a thousand pages of his fourth book: a memoir that moves from his growing up as the son of a high school English teacher in Manchester, N.H., to his undergraduate days at Harvard, where, he says, he was too timid and conventional to be a brilliant student, and on to Yale Law School, where he blossomed intellectually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The book ends at age 27, when he was a law clerk for Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, one of his heroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman put his knowledge of the law to use recently, when, as a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, he helped prepare a brief for the United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The future of America depends on educating minority men and women,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his 11 years as president of Dartmouth, Mr. Freedman devoted himself to making the college welcoming to what he called the creative loners, cellists, poets and mathematicians, as well as athletes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also carved out a role as a public intellectual, standing up to a group of right-wing students -- and their prominent, adult benefactors -- who were ridiculing blacks, homosexuals, women and Jews on campus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making their views known through the neoconservative, off-campus Dartmouth Review, the students ran a front page cartoon that showed Mr. Freedman, who is Jewish, dressed like Adolf Hitler. Eventually, tolerance and civility were restored.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last September, concerned by news reports that Jewish students were being intimidated on campuses amid protests over the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Freedman helped collect signatures from 310 college presidents for a statement calling for ''intimidation-free'' campuses. Some presidents criticized the statement for focusing only on Jewish students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With heavy snow falling on the streets of Cambridge, Mr. Freedman was relaxing in his living room, with Sheba, his wife of nearly 40 years, across from him. They were surrounded by some of Mr. Freedman's 2,000 favorite books, by T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, Saul Bellow, Faulkner, Joyce.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lifelong book collector, Mr. Freedman reluctantly parted with 4,000 other favorites when he left Dartmouth -- and the library at the president's house -- for Cambridge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward evening, the doorbell rang. Howard Gardner, the Harvard educational psychologist who is one of Mr. Freedman's closest friends, came in from the snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In retirement, as an elder statesman of academia, Mr. Freedman's advice is sought frequently. Professor Gardner wanted to consult with him about three academics who needed jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman is ''the ultimate search engine,'' Professor Gardner said, ''because he knows so many people, in so many ways, heart, mind, spirit.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Life is unpredictable and full of disappointment, Mr. Freedman writes in his book, the breakup of marriages, death of loved ones, enduring illness. In such a world, he writes, ''how ought one to lead a life?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''That is one of the questions that a liberal education addresses,'' he writes. ''The most effective protection against the contingencies of experience are values that appeal to our very best natures and anchor us most securely in the ocean of fate.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are the kinds of subjects Dr. Donald Kaufman, one of Mr. Freedman's oncologists, says he enjoys discussing with the former college president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''I always reserve 30 minutes for his visits,'' Dr. Kaufman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''They go on for 90. This is for my benefit, not his. He's teaching me what it means to be a patient. He's teaching people how to live.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James O.

5fdb6ef5b34a6f6b2634b566	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2236765173.xml.txt	"<div><p>How to Save Affirmative Action</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton Administration's reversal of position on a case that could be one of the most important of the Supreme Court's coming term has disappointed supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. But given the tenor of the Court's recent decisions on racial preferences, the Administration has made a smart strategic move to preserve what can and should be saved of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case concerns the decision of the Piscataway, N.J., school board to promote racial diversity by laying off a white teacher so that it could preserve the job of an equally qualified black teacher. Though the Administration had previously supported the school board, the brief it filed with the Supreme Court on Aug. 23 concedes that the board violated the civil rights of the white teacher.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In previous rulings, the Court has maintained that government use of racial preferences is constitutional only when such action is necessary to remedy a history of overt discrimination, or when the public goal being pursued is ''compelling.'' Moreover, the Court has said, the use of racial preferences must be ''narrowly tailored'' to meet the particular goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appellate court that heard the Piscataway case declared, in effect, that racial diversity could never be a compelling state interest. Should the Supreme Court completely uphold the appellate court's ruling, the use of race in decisions about hiring and firing public employees could, for all practical purposes, be prohibited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Piscataway case, the avowed goal -- racial diversity within a single, small department of an otherwise diverse faculty -- does not seem ''compelling.'' And the way the school board chose to pursue its goal of diversity -- dismissing a white teacher solely because of her race -- was not ''narrowly tailored.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By acknowledging this, yet at the same time making a broader argument for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, the Administration hopes to preserve some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring. The approach it has suggested in its brief is essentially a compromise. Even if the Piscataway school board was wrong in this specific instance in its use of racial preference, the Administration argues, there is still a place for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and not only to remedy past discrimination. Indeed, as it points out in its brief, there are times when taking race into account is the only way to further compelling public goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A police department, for example, may need to recruit a diverse officer corps to carry on effective undercover work or to retain public confidence in neighborhoods where there are racial tensions. At schools and colleges, a diverse faculty may, through the example of its own collegiality, teach students important lessons about working across racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the absolutist opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have the upper hand, in the courts as well as in the broader public debate. California now outlaws the use of race in public hiring, contracting and education. And in a case challenging <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> at the University of Texas Law School, a Federal appeals court ruled last year that racial diversity in a student body could never constitute a compelling state interest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court declined to review that decision, but in taking on the Piscataway case, the Court has the opportunity to clarify the question of when, if ever, it is legitimate to use <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> to achieve racial diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a grave error for the Court to adopt an absolutist color-blind view on the question of whether race should ever be a factor in decisions about public employment. Moreover, it is impossible to maintain such absolutism and still uphold a commitment to prevent racial discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider efforts to recruit job applicants that are directed toward minority candidates -- as when companies send recruiters to heavily black schools when blacks are underrepresented in their work force. Such efforts would clearly violate the color-blind principle. Even when the final hiring decision is made solely on the basis of an applicant's qualifications, without regard to race, these recruitment programs involve discrimination because they bestow the benefits of better job information and a greater number of alternative job offers on some individuals solely because of their race. Yet these programs are widespread in both the public and the private sectors, and they are needed to prevent discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to public employment, the Administration makes a strong case for considering race. Indeed, its argument could also be applied to the lifetime appointments to the Federal courts that interpret the constitutionality of race-based state action. The legitimacy of court rulings in this area would surely be undermined by the absence from the bench of nonwhite members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't mean that racial quotas should be used for judicial appointments. But as far as the Federal judiciary is concerned, there is a compelling public interest in racial diversity for its own sake. Perhaps the Justices who decide the Piscataway case will have the wisdom to see this point.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

The 1957 attempt by the Arkansas governor Orval Faubus to block Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School led to threats of violence against the federal judge who enforced the court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. That judge, Ronald N. Davies, was “uncowed,” the chief justice wrote, despite being “physically threatened.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“A judicial system cannot and should not live in fear,” Chief Justice Roberts added as he thanked Congress for passing a law last year to protect judges. The new law was named in honor of Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, who was murdered in 2020 in an assault meant for the judge at her home. The law screens from the public the personal information of federal judges and their families, including identifiers such as license plate numbers and addresses. Leaders like the chief justice deserve praise when they highlight the dangers all public officials now face.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Focusing on the Brown decision was nonetheless surprising. After all, the court appears poised to reverse a decision upholding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in school admissions, one of the very remedies that the Brown decision spawned, and which all nine members of the court stood squarely behind in 1954 and reaffirmed in a subsequent case in 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, the chief justice sometimes used his year-end report to describe substantive reforms in the federal courts, like the task force created in 2018 in response to allegations that federal judges had harassed their staffs sexually and in other ways. Not so in his latest report, which was four pages long with a five-page appendix. Chief Justice Roberts did not mention any of the many issues that made the news about the court last year — the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices whose actions or those of family members raise questions about impartiality, the leak of a draft of the court’s decision overturning abortion rights, the insufficiency of financial disclosure and questions about fund-raising for the Supreme Court Historical Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor did the chief justice explore the troubling data in his report’s appendix on “the workload of the courts.” The numbers document a sharp decline of the use of the federal courts. Federal appellate filings fell again in the fiscal year 2022, a steady decline from 49,000 in 2018 to fewer than 42,000 last year. Trial-level civil cases in the federal district courts have fallen precipitously as well — down from more almost 283,000 cases in 2018 to about 240,000 in 2022.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In calculating totals and the trend in civil cases, court administrators did not include about 321,000 filings that, starting in 2020, were brought by military service members and veterans who claimed that combat earplugs sold by 3M to the U.S. military were faulty. Under a federal statute, those cases became, in effect, one litigation, consolidated before trial in front of a single judge, and they are an example of the importance of people having access to courts, which can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The opinions of the very court that the chief justice leads provide insight into the decline. We know from our own experience that savvy civil rights lawyers now steer clear of federal court. Winning in the appellate courts risks having the Supreme Court’s conservative majority extinguish any gains won for women, prisoners, the environment and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dwindling numbers of filings at the trial level in the U.S. District Courts also derive in part from what the Supreme Court has done during the last few decades — to close the courthouse doors to many would-be litigants, in class-action lawsuits and other cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key example can be found in the court’s interpretations of the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In a series of cases that began in the 1980s, the court has read the statute to mean that employers and businesses can include arbitration clauses in lengthy, dense, fine-print documents with consumers and employees that bar access to courts and to class actions. Even complaints of violations of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and of federal laws regulating securities, fair credit, unlawful mergers and unfair business practices can be forced into arbitration rather than being litigated in court. Anyone aggrieved has to go, one by one, to private arbitration. In practice, almost none do, because most people don’t have the resources to pursue small-value claims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, the veterans in the combat earplug cases were able to get into court because no arbitration mandate kept them out. And once in court, because of procedures designed to make group-based litigation easier, they could combine resources to pursue their arguments of hearing loss and tinnitus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The “state of the judiciary” address is a bully pulpit constructed decades ago by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Given the challenges the country faces, we need a chief justice who helps us all talk seriously about what ails the federal courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts’s focus on 1950s desegregation litigation is a poignant reminder that once federal courts led the way in protecting civil rights and making courts accessible to all. His court, however, has made plain it has no interest in opening doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that, we need Congress to reinvigorate federal rights and end the power of would-be defendants to control access. That’s what Congress did in 2022 when it amended the 1925 arbitration statute to let victims of sexual assault and harassment decide if they want to sue in court rather than consider using arbitration. The chief justice properly commended Congress for making strides in protecting federal judges. Now Congress needs to protect and support the right to bring cases to those judges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nancy Gertner, a retired Federal District Court judge, is a senior lecturer in law at Harvard Law School.

Many people I interact with outside my job don’t even know that I am a professor, or that I have a doctoral degree. When I introduce myself in public, I’m Carlotta Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when I introduce myself in the classroom, I’m Dr. Berry. And I insist on being Dr. Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Titles in the academy are inconsistent at best. I have colleagues who would prefer to be called by their first name, or nicknames like “Bone Saw.” But they are mostly men, and almost all white, and they have that luxury. As an African-American woman in a mostly Caucasian- and male-dominated field, I don’t.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some find my insistence on this formality a bit pretentious or arrogant. But they don’t understand my story, and that of many other women and people of color in the academy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having worked with thousands of students, I know for a fact that for many — though by no means all, or even most — there is already a presumption that I, as a female and African-American, am less qualified than my white male colleagues, or at the very least that I was hired in order to meet a double minority quota. And I get it — anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> ideologues have managed to not only demolish the legitimacy of that policy, but tar the reputation of anyone who might have benefited from it (even if, like me, they did not).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do I know? Sometimes it’s just a sense, a feeling I get from people’s tone of voice. But some students will automatically call me Ms., while naturally referring to my male counterparts as Doctor or Professor. I’m not alone: When I meet fellow female engineering professors at conferences, this sort of treatment is always a topic of conversation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In class, I have my derivations questioned, lectures critiqued, grading regarded as too harsh or unfair and my expectations dismissed as too high or difficult. I once had a student who would review notes with me that he had taken on my lecture, then offer tips on how I could improve. It seems he thought he was doing me a favor, despite the fact that I had been teaching for six years by then. I doubt that this is an experience that many of my male colleagues have ever had to endure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On other occasions, I have had students state that it is difficult to follow my lectures because of my dialect or slang (neither of which I have, or use).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what can I do? I already have to run faster and jump higher just to gain that minimal level of respect that my colleagues are graciously, automatically afforded. But I can also insist that my students interact with me in a professional manner, even if it’s not something they’re accustomed to in other classes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I tell friends outside the academy about these challenges, they’re often surprised. It’s 2014, and this is higher education, where enlightened worldviews are supposed to dominate. But consider that according to data from the American Society for Engineering Education, as of 2011 African-American women made up 4 percent of all women in the engineering professoriate. Between 2001 and 2012, the number of African-American engineering faculty members increased to 3 percent from 2 percent. In all, in 2012 there were only 140 African-American women working as engineering professors — out of some 24,640 across the entire field (not including computer engineering).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For me, this statistical desert is made even more stark by the fact that, at a private school in a Midwestern town like mine, students may have interacted with African-Americans only in the service industry, or in high school, with female teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I decided to become an engineering professor 20 years ago while sitting in class and realizing that I had never had a professor who looked like me, acted like me or even seemed interested in me. I was typically one of only two or three female students, and one of only one or two African-American students. I wanted to change the face of engineering by showing that the profession could be cool, interesting, exciting, engaging and, most important, diverse. In that way, insisting that students use my title isn’t just about me — it’s about broadcasting, to any female and black students who might hear it, that I am black, a woman, and an engineer, and that they can be the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I enter my classroom today, I am still one of only two or three women in my department (depending on how you count the faculty), and I am one of only one or two African-Americans. Still, I hope that someday, when an African-American woman walks into an engineering classroom, the students recognize that the professor has arrived, and that she won’t have to insist on their calling her Doctor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>			stance:::In Favor/Supports

It seemed to echo the 1960s song that asked the same question about war. But it turned the era's rhetoric against itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I read the first paragraph, I was ready to give that little whippersnapper a history lesson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""As an above-average Latino student in a predominantly Caucasian school, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is a program that would benefit me greatly,"" wrote Miguel, 17. ""As a human being, though, I feel it should be abolished.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's galling. My own flesh and blood calling for an end to a program I advocated when I was about his age. When I enrolled at UC Berkeley, there were only a handful of minorities at the prestigious campus. As human beings, we felt justified in trying to shatter the ivory tower of privilege supported at public expense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, where have all the fighters gone?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A quarter-century later, Miguel was ready to trash a hard-won solution that had clearly worked. He called it unfair. Outdated. Reverse racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I felt the urge to confront him, but I didn't. I paused, and reconsidered my knee-jerk defense of the program voters had already eliminated. I realized Miguel was right on one score: It would be unfair for him to get a break for his race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miguel had the background and benefits he needed to succeed on his own. Both his parents are UC graduates and bilingual. His public school ranked in the nation's top 100 academically. And he wanted for nothing at home. He had his own room with his own computer and even a loft with a spiral staircase.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hardly a hard-luck case. Clearly, if he didn't make the grade, he'd have only himself to blame. Still, I couldn't agree with his conclusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why kill a program designed to compensate for social disadvantages just because you don't suffer any?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about his less privileged peers? The students from poor areas who have to work to survive. Who sleep on couches and study in closets because their homes are so crowded. Whose parents don't speak English and don't have even high school diplomas. Whose schools are short on textbooks and good teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> once pried open opportunities in an era when politicians stood in schoolhouse doors to keep minorities out. The goal was to integrate institutions that helped perpetuate racial disparities outside their ivy-covered walls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, disparities are still stark, but we can be more selective. We can target students who really need help. Just consider the list of high schools that send the most and the fewest students to UC.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, admission and affluence are correlated. Just as race and affluence are. Communities at the top of the admissions list: Palos Verdes, Irvine, Palo Alto. Those near the bottom: Santa Ana, Compton and East San Jose, where I grew up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These underrepresented areas will be the ones to benefit most under the new plan that broadens UC eligibility to all students who rank in the top 4% of their high schools. The modest plan doesn't guarantee they'll be admitted. It simply helps identify rural and inner-city students in junior year who should be aspiring to UC, says Manuel Gomez, a UC Irvine vice chancellor and my old college friend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university already knows an extra push can make the difference in a district like Santa Ana, which is only 3% white. A UC Irvine outreach program this year helped 23 Valley High School students boost their SAT scores by an average of almost 100 points, including one kid who soared 270 points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The students paid $35 for the Kaplan Review, a $700 prep course. And even that nominal fee was refunded for those with perfect attendance on weekends and after school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the kids got their money back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm told the university already considers social factors in accepting students. Success in the face of adversity counts extra. That's not a race-based policy. It's just that some races see more adversity than others. That's reality-based.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Students who achieve highly within their own set of circumstances ought to be acknowledged and rewarded for it,"" said Bob Laird, director of undergraduate admissions at my alma mater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even my son saw the light after we had a talk. In his final draft, Miguel reconsidered his <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> ban in light of ""the quietly segregated ways of the United States.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His final recommendation: ""Give equal opportunity to everybody who tries hard and a chance for success to all who pursue it.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's my boy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Agustin Gurza's column appears Tuesday and Saturday.

Slaughter professor of law at Yale University, has written a guest essay for Times Opinion that describes a middle path between the full repeal of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and its persistence on campus. In his piece, Driver writes about how Justice Sandra Day O’Connor (for whom he served as a Supreme Court clerk) wrote a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003 that upheld <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. In that opinion, she wrote that the court “expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.” Driver argues that the years remaining on the clock that started with Grutter could offer public and private institutions of higher learning a way to adapt to race-neutral admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In another essay last week, Linda Greenhouse, who reported on the Supreme Court for The Times from 1978 to 2008, casts the upcoming oral arguments as evidence that the meaning of Brown v.

He did and he was.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't remember everything that John H. Johnson, the pioneer black publisher, said when he was honored by the National Association of Black Journalists in 1987. But I probably will never forget his three words of advice:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Make yourself indispensable.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to find three better words that sum up the successful business philosophy of John Harold Johnson, who died Monday at age 87.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To black Americans of my generation, Johnson's publications Ebony, Jet and Negro Digest were indispensable reading matter, offering a brighter and more prosperous vision of black America than most of the mainstream--also known as ""white-owned""--media provided.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To advertisers, Johnson's pioneering publications broke through the myth that the black consumer market was not worth targeting through black-owned media.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today the newsstands are filled with magazines niche-marketed to blacks or Hispanics, but that really began with Johnson back in the 1940s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And to journalists, particularly black journalists, Johnson's publications provided employment, a training ground and a model for how people of color might be covered in a more complete fashion than simply crime, sports or show business stories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His 1989 autobiography ""Succeeding Against the Odds"" reads almost like a business-school series of case studies in how to solve whatever problems life throws at you.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Arkansas refused to educate black children in his area past the 8th grade, his mother, Gertrude Johnson Williams, a cook and domestic worker, saved for two years to move her family to Chicago in the 1930s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Young Johnnie was working days at a black-owned life insurance company and studying at night at Northwestern University when he started up Negro Digest in 1942 with $500 that his mother raised by borrowing against the family furniture.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When its circulation stalled at 50,000 a few months later, he persisted in requesting a guest column from Eleanor Roosevelt until she agreed, immediately boosting circulation to 100,000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1945, Johnson launched Ebony, a picture magazine for blacks. Its initial press run of 25,000 copies was completely sold out. Pocket-size Jet magazine began in 1951. Jet helped launch the modern civil rights movement in 1955 when it published open-casket funeral photos of the mangled body of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Chicagoan who was savagely murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite its annual special editions focusing thoughtfully on major issues of black politics and economics, we black journalists, among others, often ridiculed the sugar-coated emphasis that Ebony and Jet put on the upwardly ambitious black middle class. Yet we also understood Johnson's reluctance to focus on negative news about black life, since there was so much of that in the mainstream media.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bourgeois flavor of Johnson's publications was a minor criticism in the life of a man who overcame tremendous hardships to fill an important vacuum in black life and become one of America's wealthiest businessmen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With that in mind, his ""make yourself indispensable"" speech had special resonance. Speaking to his audience of predominately young and aspiring print and broadcast journalists, he offered us the example of Matthew Henson, the black man who helped Adm. Robert Peary reach the North Pole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Henson was not hired under any <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> plan or out of the goodness of Peary's heart, Johnson pointed out. Henson was hired because he had taken the time to learn the language of the Inuit people, who were indispensable to their journey.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Johnson did not mention was the equally fascinating story of how he gave an autographed copy of Henson's autobiography to Zenith Electronics Corp. chief executive officer Eugene McDonald, after hearing that McDonald was a fan of arctic explorers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McDonald was impressed enough by the gift and by a four-page Ebony feature on Henson that Zenith became Ebony's first major corporate advertiser in the 1950s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He helped persuade other major corporate advertisers to follow, a major breakthrough at the time for black-oriented media. Two decades later, Johnson was elected to Zenith's board of directors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Johnson's career was full of stories like that. His life presents case studies in leadership, which is, above all, the art of problem solving. While others might fret, moan or whine, he was a get-it- done kind of guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He understood that no one, black or otherwise, would patronize your business purely out of racial loyalty. Consumers in a free market want value, service and quality. He set a high standard for all three. Despite the changing times that his publications helped to bring about, he found ways to stay indispensable. So must we all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clarence Page is a member of the Tribune's editorial board.

5fdb6ef5b34a6f6b2634b566	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421591042.xml.txt	"<div><p>Commentary; SAT's 'Halo Effect' Casts a Long Shadow</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The discussion emanating from the University of California regarding the SAT is an invigorating move for American higher education. It is long overdue. The SAT is ideally viewed as a yardstick of merit. It has been used for decades as a key criterion for admission to four-year colleges and universities. Yet, in reality, the SAT is a poorly defined test that reflects racial and economic privileges. It reproduces sex, race and class inequalities in access to the nation's educational resources that produce wealth and power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The SAT affords a too-easy sorting of students' applications into the categories of admit, maybe admit and don't admit. The problem is that many of the students in the don't-admit category could succeed with flying colors if they were given the chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The SAT creates a halo effect that colors the more holistic evaluation of applicants' statements of purpose and letters of recommendation. It creates a mind-set that is tough to overcome for students who don't have the ""test-wiseness"" to correctly fill the bubbles on questions that involve obscure vocabulary or reasoning that is embedded in white cultural trivia. Students might be expected to know Shakespeare or Voltaire, but they are safe if they are ignorant of Wheatley or Nkrumah. After more than 20 years of college teaching, I've learned that the single most important criterion for a student's success is his or her motivation and effort, attributes that are untapped by SAT scores.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've seen students with abysmal scores excel and students with stellar ones flounder. For millions of aspiring college students, the SAT tests students on material that they have not been taught. In the context of known racial inequalities in educational opportunity, the use of an inflexible yardstick such as the SAT is inherently racist. Ward Connerly, the regent who has led the movement to abolish <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> at UC and in the nation, suggested that he would not want the banning of the SAT to be a ""proxy"" for racial preferences. But the use of the SAT is, in fact, a proxy for maintaining the racial and economic advantages of rich whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UC President Richard H. Atkinson is correct in casting doubt on the SAT, but he is wrong in suggesting that the SAT II, a subject- matter test, is an improvement. Students are advised to take the verbal and math sections of the SAT II (and a subject area of their choosing), which re-create the same biases as the SAT I. Standardized tests cannot assess merit in the context of non- standardized educational experiences. This is also true for the tests that act as gatekeepers to the professions, the MCAT (for medicine), the LSAT (for law) and the GRE (for the social sciences and humanities).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The under-representation of minorities who face discrimination in undergraduate programs dramatically worsens in graduate schools. Much is at stake in Atkinson's proposal because of the multibillion- dollar nature of the testing and test-preparation industries. Students waste valuable time and money in preparing for exams that are irrelevant to their success or failure in higher education. Students take the tests several times in hopes of improving their scores--a cost that is prohibitive to families that do not have financial resources.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SAT scores are weak predictors of first-year college success, explaining only 10% of the variance in grades, and have virtually no bearing on subsequent success or failure. Other measures of presumed merit, such as grade-point averages, are also problematic. GPAs are inflated by advanced placement courses that may produce GPAs above 4.0. We know that students in predominantly African American and Latino schools have less access to these courses, just as they have less access to books and experienced teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a perverse irony, African American and Latino communities support public institutions that they do not benefit from in proportion to their tax dollars. Admissions procedures must eschew criteria that have known biases and incorporate those that allow students' drive and determination to manifest themselves. They should emphasize the more important qualities of critical thinking, intercultural awareness and a healthy skepticism of the so-called knowledge items contained in the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead of spending billions of dollars to exclude students, we should redirect those dollars to create more seats in more universities.

Patrick Fitzgerald's Thursday news conference about the Duff financial empire. It was time for lunch; I was hungry and wanted to think this through. There was only one place to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""You've just got to go to Gene's,"" said a friend and colleague. She meant my favorite steakhouse, and the Duffs' favorite steakhouse, Gene & Georgetti's.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gene's is a hangout where information is traded, among politicians, insiders, reporters, wise-guys, salesmen, consultants, from the buttoned down to the gold chains crowd. And what makes it work is that they serve the best steak in the city, period. The service is impeccable without being showy and the drinks are honest. Gene's is a part of the old Chicago, the city as it was before so much of the downtown was turned into a theme park.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also the place where the Duffs came up to me about a year ago, their tough, hard eyes smiling. They asked me why they don't ever see my children playing in the front yard of my home in the suburbs. They asked it twice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the columns didn't stop and neither did the news stories by the investigative reporters, or Tribune editorials about the mayor's friends. And here's why:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not about getting personal with the mayor or the Duffs. Though the mayor has been a frequent target in my column, what drives the criticism is the obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars that go to his pals. In deal after deal after deal, the attitude is that his guys can take what they want and the people in the neighborhoods better shut up about it, while higher taxes put more and more pressure on families to pay for the deals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not personal, it's business, and it's your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley is an able politician and has done some good things, including taking personal responsibility for trying to improve the public schools. But he must also take personal responsibility for his friends who get rich on government contracts he controls, paid for by our tax dollars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Duff stories broke in 1999, when Tribune investigative reporters Ray Gibson, Andrew Martin and Laurie Cohen wrote about the Duffs' City Hall deals and their connections to Daley and the Outfit. You can find the archive of the stories available on the Tribune's Web site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of what was alleged in the indictments was laid out in those stories: that the Duffs, who are white, ran phony front companies that got $100 million in city contracts that should have gone to firms owned by women or minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley knew the Duffs were not minorities, even when he was a crime-fighting Cook County state's attorney. A Duff sits across from you, gives you campaign cash, pours a drink, it's reasonable to assume that even the mayor could tell whether the person was white or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Think back to how the media treated the late Mayor Harold Washington, when Washington's buddies were involved in contract scandals. Back then, even minor stories about corruption got sustained media attention, particularly from TV and radio, even if the dollar amounts were only chump change. Washington faced constant media pressure on corruption issues. TV crawled all over him for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If I was white, you wouldn't be doing this to me,"" Washington said once, in a private moment, as he filched a smoke from me and we stood in a parking lot after a campaign stop. We argued about it, and I told him that since we were off the record, he didn't have to play the race card. ""You don't know anything, do you?"" he said. He was right. I was a kid, then. I didn't know.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the Duff stories first broke, involving a white mayor and white guys getting rich, the Chicago media scrutiny wasn't as intense. TV news didn't hound Daley the way it hounded Washington. The mayor must appreciate the kindness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm sure he also appreciates the new federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald. The feds have already outflanked former Gov. George Ryan's Republicans. Ryan himself is a target. And now the feds are moving toward Daley's Democratic City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Daley-Duff relationship is not just a Tribune story anymore. A group of citizens--sworn as federal grand jurors--looked at the evidence. They didn't find a flaw in the system, as the city claims. They found a crime.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A couple friends and I talked of this at Gene's, about the change in things, about the importance of an independent federal prosecutor, about how the bipartisan political clique that runs this state tried to stop Fitzgerald's appointment in hopes of installing one of their own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just then, the cell phones began chirping and word of the Duff indictments began to spread through the bar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had our steaks medium rare. And they were tasty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

Al ""The Mushroom"" Grzyb picked up his own phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a small miracle because the call lasted only 20 seconds. But that was long enough for him to explain that he didn't know anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't know anything about the Duffs and Waste Management and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And he didn't have any opinion on how the tough pink guys got $100 million in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> contracts through Mayor Richard Daley's administration. That's odd, since he was Daley's purchasing agent for 11 years, and he was the political firing pin on just about every political deal benefiting Daley's cronies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Just so you know, if there's anything you have, I haven't read anything about it,"" Grzyb said nervously.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I knew it! That's big news right there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb is obviously a loyal Sun-Times reader. They buried the Duff story Tuesday. Perhaps they didn't have a new logo they could use to claim it as their own--say a photo of the Duffs drinking with Daley at their legendary Como Inn Christmas parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And TV isn't interested in the Duff story much, either. The news broke Monday afternoon as federal prosecutors released court documents outlining their case against the Duffs. A TV reporter who has said publicly that he's not afraid of angering Daley explained why TV isn't interested. He'd like to do the Duff story, really, but there are no ""visuals.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he meant is that there are no cars in it, or trucks, things that go ""vrrooom"" with lights flashing and so on in the file tape. That's TV news for you. There's not much video excitement in a contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I thought that $100 million to white guys with Outfit connections who allegedly pretend to be minorities--and convinced their buddy Rich Daley of it too--is an interesting story, especially with the Duff federal fraud trial weeks away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I'm not with the city anymore,"" Grzyb said, as if we didn't know, since we called him at Elzie Higginbottom's business office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom's company, East Lake Management, ran that building at 69 W. Washington St., where six people died after being trapped in a stairwell with locked doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom is a Daley guy, and Grzyb needed a soft place to land after he got too hot for City Hall. It's nice to know that Higginbottom's office can protect at least one person from heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb, whose name means ""mushroom"" in Polish, was asked about the Duff-Waste Management-Blue Bag deal that the U.S. attorney's office outlined in federal court filings this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my reading of the documents, here's how it played out: A City Hall underling figured out that the Duffs were not minorities, then had the audacity to deny their minority certification on the Blue Bag contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sensing a grave injustice by being denied an opportunity to become minorities, one of the Duffs discussed this blatant discrimination with a top trucking boss and a Waste Management official and a ""City Official A.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon, Troy Ratliff, a deputy of Grzyb's, overruled the underlings. Grzyb approved the Duff contract for workers to sort out recyclable garbage for Waste Management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I don't really have any opinions on it,"" Grzyb said. ""I don't work for the city anymore. If you have any questions, call the city's press office.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb has been at the center of other deals for Daley. And he was never brought before the Chicago City Council for confirmation, because he didn't have the proper credentials under the State Purchasing Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he had the one credential that counts. He knew how to say yes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grzyb? Who was the Waste Management official you met with on the Duff deal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I don't really have any comment,"" Grzyb said. ""That's it. Thank you.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mushroom then hung up the phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He wasn't the only non-chatty type Tuesday. The mayor says he hates corruption. But he had nothing to say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""First of all, I'm not going to comment on it, it's a pending [federal] case,"" the mayor told me, a bit peeved, which is his usual expression when I come within 1,200 yards of him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I know nothing about it, I tell you,"" Daley insisted. ""I know nothing about it, any other questions?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've been critical of the Duff-Daley deal, but now it might be time to reconsider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We Americans tell our children they can grow up to be anything, from cowboys to astronauts. So why can't the white guy Duffs aspire to minority status, even if it's only on paper, and even if they are white men?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What kind of a country do we live in, anyway? Is this the land of opportunity, or is it not?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least at Chicago's City Hall, miracles do happen, sometimes. And a very large miracle brought the Duffs $100 million of your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed		
60fece35afedb0bdd821592a	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421978637.xml.txt	"<div><p>Rehnquist's Mixed Legacy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sixteen men have served as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Some, like Melville W. Fuller, who presided from 1888 to 1910, inhabit the shadows of the court's history. Others, possessed of deeply held views and blessed with longevity or a favorable political wind at their backs, have touched Americans more profoundly than many presidents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fourth chief, John Marshall, was the first to leave his mark. It will surprise many people to learn that nothing in the Constitution explicitly authorizes the Supreme Court to decide whether acts of Congress are constitutional. In Marbury vs. Madison, Marshall deduced this power from the structure of government that the Constitution created -- and thus he created the institution of judicial review. More than a century later, Chief Justice Earl Warren led his colleagues to apply constitutional principles to outlaw racial segregation and to expand the rights of criminal defendants. Racial equality and the right to a lawyer may seem like obvious constitutional principles today; they didn't before Warren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When William H. Rehnquist joined the Supreme Court in 1972, he had ambitions that were similar in size but different in substance. Did he succeed? After 33 years on the court, the last 19 as its leader, Rehnquist's record is mixed. The Rehnquist court has slowed the expansion of civil rights but has not reversed it in most areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Victim of Cancer</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief justice has cancer and is mostly working from home. This comes after years of rumors that back troubles would force his resignation. The cancer diagnosis last fall intensified predictions of his impending retirement and sparked new discussions of his legacy and the court's future direction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist found his politics early, in dinner-table discussions with his Milwaukee parents and, after Pearl Harbor, as a neighborhood block captain responsible for reporting ""subversive activities"" to the police. His interest in history, forged in high school reenactments of the nation's founding, has endured in his writings, on the bench and off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those writings, Rehnquist will often hearken back to the period after the Civil War. Many think of the Reconstruction era as one of brutal repression of minorities and a pinched view of the federal government. Rehnquist, however, finds his legal and ideological touchstones in those years: states' rights, a narrow view of congressional authority and a bone-deep skepticism about the notion that law should protect private behavior. As a Supreme Court clerk, Rehnquist wrote memos urging his boss, Justice Robert H. Jackson, to dissent in voting-rights and school desegregation cases. Young Rehnquist scornfully dismissed pleas from criminal defendants. When Rehnquist became a justice himself, he took his own advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist has been least successful in the realm of private behavior. The abortion rights decision, Roe vs. Wade, came a year after he joined the court, and the core of that decision stands three decades later, despite Rehnquist's fierce opposition. The constitutional ban on school prayer also remains. Rehnquist's years saw the court uphold laws forbidding consensual sex among homosexuals and, over his objection, then saw the court reverse itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has had his successes. Rehnquist pushed the court to narrow or reverse many protections the Warren court had declared for criminal suspects, prisoners, racial minorities and students, boosting the authority of police, prosecutors, prison wardens and school officials. He and his colleagues struck down New Deal-era federal laws on the grounds that even the commerce clause of the Constitution -- formerly an all-purpose authority for the use of federal power -- did not authorize them. The Rehnquist court struck down laws concerning gun control, sexual assaults and cigarettes on this basis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States' Rights Booster</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sovereign authority of the states, by contrast, got a boost from Rehnquist. States are now largely free to execute murderers, destroy some inland wetlands and ponds, demote state employees who develop breast cancer or lock up some petty thieves for life, as California has chosen to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stopwatch efficiency that has earned Rehnquist high marks as the court's manager is also evident in his often-sparse opinions. Here it has not served him or the court as well. Instead of articulating principles that can guide judges and lawmakers, Rehnquist has often focused on the facts at hand. Your guess is as good as a constitutional scholar's about how the court will rule on any given <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> program. Why some terrorism suspects are entitled to legally challenge their confinement and others are not is similarly mysterious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist's most memorable accomplishment will probably be his most ignominious, and one of the most ""activist"" rulings in the court's history: essentially installing George W. Bush as president in the fatuously reasoned Bush vs. Gore. In the years before 2000, the Rehnquist court had rejected equal-protection claims from death row inmates complaining of racial bias, California homeowners challenging wide disparities in the property tax, gays and lesbians who wanted to serve in the military, and so on. But the same justices found that George W. Bush was a victim of an injustice worthy of the court's intervention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The selection of Rehnquist's successor, whenever it happens, will be a high-stakes battle. Both sides believe that important precedents, Roe among them, now hang on one vote. Rehnquist's replacement with another conservative may not much change the court's balance, but with eight of the nine justices over 65, the next vacancy could occur soon, allowing Bush to shift the court sharply right and finish the job Rehnquist started.</p></div>"		stance:::None/Not Discussed

60fece35afedb0bdd821592a	aa_opeds_sample/txt/423943644.xml.txt	"<div><p>BEHIND THE MIAMI RIOT; by David Whitman</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the aftermath of the Miami riot, black leaders and liberal politicians have advanced with renewed vigor the thesis that race riots result from racial discrimination. This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim,  county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held  by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason. The whole community has paid a terrible price.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies of the 1966-69 riots indicate that rioters are especially vulnerable  to feelings of ''relative deprivation'' -that is, they are most likely to resort to violence when they see the conditions of those around them (often other blacks) improving. While many blacks benefited from the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, the mass of blacks in the ghettos remains unaffected, and city after city erupted in racial violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1980, these conditions exist once again. Over the last 15 years, a class gap between the haves and have-nots has been slowly widening in most urban black communities. While the black middle class has doubled during that time (to between 35 percent and 45 percent of the American black population of 25.8 million), the size of the black lower class has barely diminished, and the proportion of workingclass blacks in menial service jobs may have actually increased. For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent. (The rest of the black work force is in higher-paying blue-collar jobs, and there is a minute percentage in farm work.)  Dillusionment among poor blacks in Miami is also heightened by the fact that bilingual and lighter-skinned Cubans have taken many of the jobs that traditionally have provided openings for blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dramatic growth of the American black middle class has resulted largely from a wholesale decline of racial discrimination in the labor market since the  1964 Civil Rights Act, but, unfortunately, this decline has not benefited disadvantaged blacks who lack the opportunity to attend college and compete for  corporate and government jobs. These blacks, in urban cores, must seek workingclass jobs that pay a living wage. Unfortunately, desirable bluecollar jobs in craft work and manufacturing are increasingly rare in central cities. Trends in the economy, such as automation and the suburbanization of industrial  production, mean that poor blacks, especially young, uneducated ones, spend most of their time competing for dead-end service jobs such as janitorial work.  These trends remain unaffected by strategies to fight discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our most conspicuous such strategy is <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and, indeed, already we are hearing that the answer to the Miami riot is to invigorate <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs. However well-intentioned such responses may be, undoubtedly they will have a perverse effect on race relations. By using race-conscious criteria, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> creates a divisive backlash among ethnic groups and workingclass whites. In addition, such programs also widen the class gap in the black community by helping a small portion of the community to  attend college, graduate school, and compete for desirable jobs, while the most  disadvantaged segments of the black community remain essentially untouched. What poor blacks need, at a minimum, is programs that are drected toward them: programs that will ensure full employment, increase teen-age employment opportunities, and meaningfully reform the welfare system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regrettably, these programs, or what is left of them, are being slashed from  the Federal budget. In the absence of these modest efforts, we cannot expect any significant improvement in the lot of poor blacks, regardless of strenuous efforts to combat discrimination. If the Congress and President Carter insist on cutting these programs to provide increased defense spending, then we must also face the perilous prospect that our cities will remain racial tinderboxes.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- David Whitman is a senior research assistant at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

As executive director of the Rev. Pat Robertson's very big, influential and conservative Christian Coalition, Reed has vigorously opposed mainstream civil rights leaders on such key issues as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and welfare reform.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, the idea of Beijing hosting the notoriously Red-baiting Nixon sounded laughable, too, until it happened. At least Reed has a shorter leap to make than Nixon did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reed has long called on white, Christian conservatives to make amends for centuries they spent on the wrong side of black liberation. In his 1994 book, ""Politically Incorrect: The Emerging Faith Factor in American Politics,"" he wrote that historical cooperation with slavery and segregation ""undermined the moral authority of religious conservatives as they have sought to redress other forms of social injustice--abortion, euthanasia, religious bigotry--in recent times.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To plug the gap, the coalition has announced Samaritan Project, a multiracial program to rejuvenate low-income, inner-city neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Headed by an African-American, the Rev. Earl Jackson, the coalition's national liaison for community development, the Samaritan Project offers compassionate conservatives a chance to put their money where their mouths are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among other ideas, it proposes a new multiracial partnership to revitalize local churches and rejuvenate the national debate on racial justice. It commits the coalition's members and its network of 125,000 churches to raise funds for partnerships with 1,000 inner-city churches by 2000, particularly for those churches which are helping at-risk youths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On racial justice, the coalition plans a May conference in Baltimore to which black and white church leaders from across the nation are invited to hammer out an agenda for cooperation ""across racial and cultural lines.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a conference call with me and six other newspaper columnists last week, Reed and Jackson said the project was inspired by the organization's successful call for white churches to help rebuild black churches destroyed in last year's wave of church burnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Reed and Jackson said, they have raised $850,000 and given away most of it in grants averaging $20,000 per church to 40 congregations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""African-American leaders were far more receptive than I ever thought possible,"" Reed said. ""I never asked people whether they were Democratic or Republican or liberal or conservative. It has changed us. God took a tragedy and turned it into something good.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The help could hardly go to a better place. The black church has been the African-American community's most durable and liberating institution through times much tougher than these. Black church leaders were the core of the abolitionist movement, the civil rights movement and countless independent, self-help neighborhood housing and social service programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, their successes usually wind up on the back pages of local newspapers, if at all, making a very small blip on the media's or the public's radar screens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Christian Coalition can bring the communications network that can help black churches feel less isolated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It can also bring about public attention that can help change society's prevailing cynicism about the ability of poor people to help themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Publicity does have its virtues. Assignment editors who yawn at the efforts of a little church here or there suddenly perk up when Ralph Reed holds a press conference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the less noble side, there is no question that conservatives hope the Samaritan Project will improve not only their moral authority but also their political clout. In return, the coalition hopes it can win black support for an array of ideas liberal leaders tend to oppose: school vouchers, a tax credit (not just a deduction) for charitable donations, tax breaks to encourage business investments in depressed areas and vouchers for schools and drug rehabilitation programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each of these ideas is currently being proposed in various forms in the House by Oklahoma's J.C. Watts, Congress' only black Republican, and in the Senate by Republican Daniel Coats of Indiana.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So be it. Black church leaders will have to decide for themselves whether the Samaritan Project is manna from Heaven or a Trojan horse. In the meantime, I am delighted, after years of racially polarized national politics, to see conservatives compete with liberals for black support. It's also refreshing to see churches take the lead again for racial reconciliation. We can use a few miracles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustrtion by David Csicsko.</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports

After a furor erupted, Ms. Smith clarified her comments in an email to her team that was obtained and published by TechCrunch. It reads in part, ""Understanding that diversity includes women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. people, and all underrepresented minorities is at the heart of our work to create an environment that is inclusive of everyone,"" and ""I regret the choice of words I used to make this point.""But Ms. Smith wasn't the first to endorse the view in her initial statement. Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of ""cognitive diversity"" is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of -- individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.This overlaps with the sentiments expressed in a screed by a Google software engineer that critiqued the company's race and gender diversity efforts and ascribed the unequal representation of women in tech to ""biological causes."" It included the line, ""Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity.""To be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important. But working to increase them alone won't do anything to address the well-documented shortcomings that plague tech companies. Whether companies do it intentionally or not, I worry that they will adjust the definition of diversity so that, conveniently, it's already achieved.If our focus shifts to cognitive diversity, it could provide an easy way around doing the hard work of increasing the embarrassingly low numbers of blacks and Latinos in the ranks of employees, in leadership roles, as suppliers and vendors, and on boards. The leadership of Apple, where Ms. Smith works, was only 3 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic  in 2016. A recent report by Recode found that women made up at most 30 percent of leadership roles and no more than 27 percent of technical roles at major tech companies. The percentages of black and Latino employees in leadership was even more dismal, ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.The shift toward focusing on viewpoint or cognitive diversity may trace its roots back to the 1978 Supreme Court decision Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which set the stage for schools to consider race in admissions because of the educational benefits of diversity, rather than to redress prior discrimination. It is understandable that because the public discourse around <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> shifted along these lines, some came to believe that any kind of diversity -- including cognitive diversity -- must be equally valuable. But that means that the most meaningful ways through which this is formed (cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability and especially gender and racial differences) may be forgotten.If this happens, we could lose an important check on the tendency of people who work at tech companies to hire more people like themselves. According to the Society for Human Resources Management, employee referrals accounted for over 30 percent of all hires in 2016.

60fece35afedb0bdd821592a	test_question_pro_testing_2	"<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

But then, on a cold day in March, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new president pulled no punches, laying blame for the country's financial woes squarely on Wall Street speculators -- and, by implication, on their benefactors in Washington. ""They have no vision,"" he said, citing a passage from the Bible, ""and when there is no vision, the people perish.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Roosevelt, by contrast, clearly articulated a vision that reawakened the hope of a beleaguered nation. He spoke that day of the country's greatest need -- putting people back to work -- and he laid out a plan for achieving that goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Decades later, when Americans faced a serious recession, Bill Clinton reflected on the same biblical passage when accepting the presidential nomination at the 1992 Democratic Convention. ""I hope nobody ... in our beloved country has to go through tomorrow without a vision,"" he said. ""I hope no one ever tries to raise a child without a vision. I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the ground without a vision. For where there is no vision, the people perish.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans today aren't interested in slogans and sound bites. They want the candidates to offer them a vision, but so far neither Mitt Romney nor President Obama has done so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans are recycling tired promises from the Reagan era, preaching a gospel of small government and fiscal responsibility. But their words ring hollow. Republicans have been sounding that theme for decades, but they've never put it into practice. Reagan tripled the national debt. George W. Bush nearly doubled it, and left a legacy of debt from two unfunded wars and unfunded tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a messaging strategist who has worked with office-seekers and officeholders at all levels of government, including the presidency, I have closely examined the reaction of voters to the standard Republican narrative about taking care of ""job creators"" and eliminating ""red tape that's strangling business."" The response of voters across the political spectrum is lukewarm. Americans may yet elect Romney, but it won't be because they really buy what he's selling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters aren't hearing a clear message from Obama either. On the one hand, he's pushing for more stimulus, but he is also the architect of a ""grand bargain"" that will cut more than $2 trillion from the 2013 federal budget, imposing the same kind of ""austerity"" that has proved so counterproductive in Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why hasn't either candidate offered a clear vision that resonates with the American people?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is that, in a time that requires boldness, the two presidential candidates are both cautious by nature. But there are other reasons as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is the role of money in politics. Roosevelt attacked Wall Street in his first speech as president, and backed up his rhetoric with one piece of legislation after another to limit its power. He used government money to put Americans directly to work -- something no one had dreamed of doing before -- and created Social Security, a minimum wage and unemployment insurance. In today's political culture, presidential candidates and legislators are beholden to Wall Street to support their campaigns, which has made the passage of such measures inconceivable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second reason for the paucity of vision is historical. For nearly 50 years, the Roosevelt legacy guided Democratic and Republican presidents alike. Dwight Eisenhower scoffed at the idea, proposed by his right flank, of dismantling New Deal programs, and instead expanded the role of the federal government by creating the interstate highway system. Richard Nixon greatly extended the federal government's role in protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink by creating the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came Ronald Reagan, who drew on his charisma to undo as much of what Roosevelt built as he could. He did so by sounding themes that resonated with voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One was based on a legitimate concern that once a government program was created, it developed barnacle-like constituencies that made it as difficult to dismantle as a barrier reef. A second theme was racial, with talk of Cadillac-driving ""welfare queens."" This was a continuation of Nixon's ""Southern strategy"" that served to solidify the GOP stronghold in the South. A third spoke to the aftershock of the 1960s, one of the most rapid periods of social change in history. This was a note that resonated with many Americans, particularly with white working-class males who'd been left frightened and angry by the women's movement and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, which challenged them both at home and at work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at its heart Reagan's critique was of a government that was too powerful, too large, too intrusive. What he didn't mention was that the radical deregulation that he set in motion was also making government more corrupt with every passing campaign dollar. The result was a rising tide of inequality and insecurity for ordinary Americans unseen since the Depression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, the parties and their standard-bearers continue to labor under the broken ideology of Reagan -- an ideology that led, in the hands of George W. Bush, to the Great Recession of 2008. The struggles of working- and middle-class Americans four years later reflect the failure of any leader to transcend Reagan's ideology. Romney continues to claim it as his own, while Obama hasn't offered a coherent alternative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1987, when Reagan's vice president, George H.W. Bush, was considering a run for the presidency, he was casting about for campaign themes when a friend urged him to take some time to think about what vision he wanted to offer the American people. Oh yeah, Bush responded dismissively, ""the vision thing.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was the only one-term Republican president in the last 80 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Drew Westen is a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University and the author of ""The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.""

Keep that in mind as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems like an easy case. How could a federal statute designed to end the historic suppression of African American voting not be constitutional? The 15th Amendment gives voters of all races equal rights and expressly grants Congress the power to enforce those rights -- which Congress exercised by reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act (VRA) for 25 years in 2006.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The vote was 98 to 0 in the Senate and 390 to 33 in the House; a conservative Republican president from Texas, George W. Bush, signed the legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If judicial restraint means anything, surely it counsels Supreme Court affirmation of the VRA -- against the pending challenge by Shelby County, Ala., which says it has basically ended voter discrimination so Congress has no right to subject it, or other mostly Southern jurisdictions, to Justice Department ""pre-clearance"" of its election rules, as prescribed in Section 5 of the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Judge David Tatel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit wrote for the majority of a three-judge panel last year,""in this context, we owe much deference to the considered judgment of the People's elected representatives.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's the problem: Although hugely successful at securing the franchise for individual black voters, the Voting Rights Act has had corrosive unintended consequences, including, ironically, greater political polarization along racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As construed by courts, modified by Congress and enforced by the Justice Department, the act all but requires covered jurisdictions to maximize the concentration of African American and other minority voters in legislative districts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In theory, this enables minorities to elect candidates ""of their choice."" In practice, it divides many states into a small number of majority-black districts, which usually pick liberal African American Democrats, and a larger number of overwhelmingly white districts, which choose conservative white Republicans. Moderates get squeezed out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Voting Rights Act is one reason House debates so often pit upstart tea party Republicans from Southern suburbs against veteran African American Democrats from Southern cities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Civil rights organizations defend the legislation's current incarnation as if the risks to minority enfranchisement were unchanged since 1965. This is understandable. Much as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in universities helped build a middle class after segregation, ""opportunity districts"" for minority candidates helped create a cadre of black elected officials. The act's pre-clearance showed continuing relevance as a check on potentially discriminatory voter ID laws in Texas and South Carolina.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the law too often produces anomalies such as the 2003 case Georgia v. Ashcroft, in which civil rights organizations sided with a Republican Justice Department against a state redistricting plan on the grounds that it did not create enough majority-minority districts -- even though Georgia's African America Democratic officeholders overwhelmingly supported the plan because they wanted to spread black votes, and influence, more widely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the most part, minority voters no longer face the kind of blunt denial of voting rights that gave rise to the 1965 act; in 2012, blacks voted at a higher rate than whites, according to a Pew Research center analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In such a world, the corrosive political effects of racial gerrymandering under the VRA loom larger -- even compared with the benefits to minority candidates. The creation of safe minority districts put a floor under the number of blacks elected but also, arguably, a ceiling over how high they can rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the South, the message and ideology that win in a majority-minority district rarely work at the (majority-white) statewide level.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress didn't really tackle such issues when it extended the Voting Rights Act in 2006. Small wonder: Incumbents of both parties and all races owe their positions to the current system. A shake-up of the status quo might have exposed them, and then-President Bush, to election-year charges of racial insensitivity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fact is, by 2006 the Supreme Court had expressed concerns about the real-world consequences of the Voting Rights Act in several cases,and it has again since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It should surprise no one if the Roberts Court invokes precedent requiring that federal impositions on the states be ""congruent and proportional"" to the civil rights violations they remedy, and it strikes down, or guts, pre-clearance -- holding that rules based on mid-1960s political realities are simply out of sync with the 21st century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would be a pretty activist ruling. But it might just start a healthy debate about how we can protect voting rights while restoring the nation's political center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>lanec@washpost.com</p></div>"			stance:::In Favor/Supports
