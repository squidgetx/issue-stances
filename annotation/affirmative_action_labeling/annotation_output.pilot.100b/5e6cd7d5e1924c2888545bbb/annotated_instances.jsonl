But then, on a cold day in March, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new president pulled no punches, laying blame for the country's financial woes squarely on Wall Street speculators -- and, by implication, on their benefactors in Washington. \"They have no vision,\" he said, citing a passage from the Bible, \"and when there is no vision, the people perish.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Roosevelt, by contrast, clearly articulated a vision that reawakened the hope of a beleaguered nation. He spoke that day of the country's greatest need -- putting people back to work -- and he laid out a plan for achieving that goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Decades later, when Americans faced a serious recession, Bill Clinton reflected on the same biblical passage when accepting the presidential nomination at the 1992 Democratic Convention. \"I hope nobody ... in our beloved country has to go through tomorrow without a vision,\" he said. \"I hope no one ever tries to raise a child without a vision. I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the ground without a vision. For where there is no vision, the people perish.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans today aren't interested in slogans and sound bites. They want the candidates to offer them a vision, but so far neither Mitt Romney nor President Obama has done so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans are recycling tired promises from the Reagan era, preaching a gospel of small government and fiscal responsibility. But their words ring hollow. Republicans have been sounding that theme for decades, but they've never put it into practice. Reagan tripled the national debt. George W. Bush nearly doubled it, and left a legacy of debt from two unfunded wars and unfunded tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a messaging strategist who has worked with office-seekers and officeholders at all levels of government, including the presidency, I have closely examined the reaction of voters to the standard Republican narrative about taking care of \"job creators\" and eliminating \"red tape that's strangling business.\" The response of voters across the political spectrum is lukewarm. Americans may yet elect Romney, but it won't be because they really buy what he's selling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters aren't hearing a clear message from Obama either. On the one hand, he's pushing for more stimulus, but he is also the architect of a \"grand bargain\" that will cut more than $2 trillion from the 2013 federal budget, imposing the same kind of \"austerity\" that has proved so counterproductive in Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why hasn't either candidate offered a clear vision that resonates with the American people?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is that, in a time that requires boldness, the two presidential candidates are both cautious by nature. But there are other reasons as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is the role of money in politics. Roosevelt attacked Wall Street in his first speech as president, and backed up his rhetoric with one piece of legislation after another to limit its power. He used government money to put Americans directly to work -- something no one had dreamed of doing before -- and created Social Security, a minimum wage and unemployment insurance. In today's political culture, presidential candidates and legislators are beholden to Wall Street to support their campaigns, which has made the passage of such measures inconceivable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second reason for the paucity of vision is historical. For nearly 50 years, the Roosevelt legacy guided Democratic and Republican presidents alike. Dwight Eisenhower scoffed at the idea, proposed by his right flank, of dismantling New Deal programs, and instead expanded the role of the federal government by creating the interstate highway system. Richard Nixon greatly extended the federal government's role in protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink by creating the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came Ronald Reagan, who drew on his charisma to undo as much of what Roosevelt built as he could. He did so by sounding themes that resonated with voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One was based on a legitimate concern that once a government program was created, it developed barnacle-like constituencies that made it as difficult to dismantle as a barrier reef. A second theme was racial, with talk of Cadillac-driving \"welfare queens.\" This was a continuation of Nixon's \"Southern strategy\" that served to solidify the GOP stronghold in the South. A third spoke to the aftershock of the 1960s, one of the most rapid periods of social change in history. This was a note that resonated with many Americans, particularly with white working-class males who'd been left frightened and angry by the women's movement and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which challenged them both at home and at work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at its heart Reagan's critique was of a government that was too powerful, too large, too intrusive. What he didn't mention was that the radical deregulation that he set in motion was also making government more corrupt with every passing campaign dollar. The result was a rising tide of inequality and insecurity for ordinary Americans unseen since the Depression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, the parties and their standard-bearers continue to labor under the broken ideology of Reagan -- an ideology that led, in the hands of George W. Bush, to the Great Recession of 2008. The struggles of working- and middle-class Americans four years later reflect the failure of any leader to transcend Reagan's ideology. Romney continues to claim it as his own, while Obama hasn't offered a coherent alternative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1987, when Reagan's vice president, George H.W. Bush, was considering a run for the presidency, he was casting about for campaign themes when a friend urged him to take some time to think about what vision he wanted to offer the American people. Oh yeah, Bush responded dismissively, \"the vision thing.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was the only one-term Republican president in the last 80 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Drew Westen is a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University and the author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.\" His consulting firm, Westen Strategies, is not working for either candidate in this year's presidential race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:Danny Schwartz For The Times</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 52s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/409936292.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>The Forces That Set the Agenda</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the grand scheme of things, Social Security isn't the nation's biggest fiscal problem. That's not my view. That's the assessment of Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Bush political appointee before he became head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who says that looming financial calamities in Medicare and Medicaid are larger and more immediate worries in a strictly budgetary sense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As economic calamities go, more significant crises confront the states, which are responsible for our kids' education; the nation's hospitals, which bear the brunt of an overburdened health care system; and international institutions, which have to deal with famine, poverty and HIV/AIDS.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With all these pressing woes, how did Social Security, Terri Schiavo's end-of-life fight and judicial nominations make it to the top of the Washington agenda? It's not merely because the White House or the party in power wants them to be there. It's because deep-rooted, well-heeled organizations have been targeting those issues for years. What seems like serendipity to the public  --  why is Congress talking about trial lawyers again?  --  is more often the result of an interest group's advance work combining with the right circumstances to send an issue hurtling into the limelight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, we increasingly live in a stage-managed democracy where highly orchestrated interests filter our priorities. These groups don't have absolute power, of course. In the nation's capital, home to 30,000 registered lobbyists, hundreds of politicians, thousands of journalists and untold numbers of entrenched bureaucrats, no one's in charge. But long-established entities like the AARP, the Family Research Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce mold our collective thinking and regularly dictate the language and tenor of our civic debates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This notion runs counter to an abiding myth  --  that political leaders actually lead. That's  true sometimes, of course, but more often than not, the ideas and movements that get on the government's to-do list come from the broad middle and not from the top.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A case in point: More than a decade ago, the National Federation of Independent Business, the country's premier small-business lobby, began to methodically contact its half-million members by phone and mail to categorize them by political leanings and their willingness to contact federal lawmakers. The lobby group trained its most eager members at local seminars and sent staffers door-to-door during elections in critical congressional districts. Regular \"grass- roots\" outpourings from this made-to-order machine vaulted NFIB- championed issues onto center stage  --  especially when the Republicans it favored took control of the White House and Congress. In particular, the inheritance tax (which NFIB loyalists redubbed the \"death tax\" for marketing purposes) was repealed (temporarily so far, but Congress is now considering whether to make the repeal permanent). This was the organization's No. 1 priority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The process is a lot like surfing. Interest groups float along, waiting for the perfect wave of public sentiment or official fiat to carry their issues to victory. They can't create the wave, but they can be ready for the moment when it comes. The key is to be prepared for that moment: Not every issue has an organization with the wealth and staying power to be in that position. Those that do have a shot at winning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Lobbying is subtle and complicated,\" says John W. Kingdon, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan who studies interest groups. But the most important attribute of a successful lobbying campaign, he says, is persistence --  something that only entrenched organizations possess.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It takes a sustained organization, mobilized followers and an immense amount of power to get onto a legislative agenda,\" agrees Theodore J. Lowi, a professor of government at Cornell University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, interest groups have replaced political parties as the real influence brokers. Candidates for office rely on these groups for campaign cash, for campaign workers and, increasingly, for campaign issues  --  all of which had once been the domain of the Republican and Democratic national committees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican ground troops come from such diverse groups as the NFIB, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Family Research Council and the National Rifle Association. Democratic soldiers are recruited from places like labor unions, the trial bar and Moveon.org. \"The standard distinction between interest groups and parties used to be that parties were committed to winning elections and that pressure groups let elections happen and then tried to influence the people who got elected,\" Lowi said. \"Now interest groups through their PACs and a variety of other methods are very much involved in the pre- policy arena.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such involvement has become a prime factor in agenda-setting. Take Social Security. Few federal programs attract as much scrutiny. AARP, the nation's largest lobbying organization, is dedicated to keeping Social Security alive and well, as are groups such as the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The reason: Large portions of their membership depend on Social Security checks to survive in old age. AARP has taught a million and a half of its 35 million members how to hammer elected officials by mail, phone and in person, primarily about Social Security.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But AARP has learned that it needs to be careful what it wishes for. Its obsession with the issue has made Social Security a front- of-the-mind topic and, therefore, a perennial contender to shoot to Washington's upper tier. Ideological opponents of the current Social Security system have also been active, raising the issue's profile even higher. Free market think tanks such as the Cato Institute and anti-tax-increase lobbies have been churning out position papers for a quarter-century promoting partial privatization of Social Security as a way to undercut what they see as \"big government.\" One appreciator of that work: George W. Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So when the president went looking for a problem to solve that could guarantee him a lasting legacy  --  and, perhaps, realign party domination  --  he went for that old chestnut Social Security. He also embraced a proposal that AARP dislikes  --  the creation of private accounts. That notion has fallen flat largely because of more than $15 million worth of AARP advertising against it. When the process moves to another phase and compromises are explored, AARP is likely to become an important negotiator and perhaps the key indicator of whether the effort will succeed or fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same high-stakes maneuvering couldn't have happened with, say, Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, even though it's in more dire financial straits. Medicaid doesn't have similarly situated citizens' groups beating the bushes on its behalf. So while saving Social Security is the watchword of the day, Medicaid's fate will be to languish and occasionally fend off budget cuts until its finances reach an emergency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Terri Schiavo is another example of interest-group politics at work. The 41-year-old brain-damaged woman was in many ways not out of the ordinary. She was one of thousands of people whose families annually struggle with the question of when a relative's life has ended. But skilled marketers on the well-established, pro-life side of the abortion debate seized on her situation. The National Right to Life Committee, Operation Rescue, Priests for Life, the Family Research Council and others set up Web sites, held news conferences and raised lots of money for lawyers and for themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their pleas touched a chord with millions of Americans and made Schiavo's plight a cause celebre. The omnipresence of her situation in direct-mail communications from those groups and on talk radio made her synonymous with the battle over life and death issues of all kinds  --  from the womb to the grave. By the time Schiavo's parents had finally exhausted their legal options and her feeding tube was about to be removed permanently, the public policy pump had been thoroughly primed. Republican leaders sympathetic to the cause brought Congress back for an extraordinary weekend session. Only later did it appear, based on various polls, that the majority of Americans did not see Schiavo's case the way the Republican leadership did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, the starvation of a solitary middle-class woman in Florida riveted government for a couple of weeks while similar  --  and more severe  --  situations went almost unnoticed. Mass starvation in Sudan, for instance, was a legislative footnote by comparison. Why? It's not only that Sudan is far away and hard to solve. Help for the Sudan catastrophe lacks the backing of as many obsessively focused and widely dispersed interest groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The brewing battle in the Senate over a mere seven judicial nominees is another telling example. Groups on the political left and right are making the coming confrontation seem like World War III. (Witness the use of the word \"nuclear\" to describe the Republicans' effort to force a vote.) In fact, the debate is a warm- up for the more consequential conflict over filling the next Supreme Court vacancy as well as a stand-in for other divisive issues, such as gay rights, abortion rights and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why such tumult and passion? Organizations with wide and longstanding interest have been on the prowl for supporters on these matters for years. On the anti-Bush side are the Alliance for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and People for the American Way, which was instrumental in derailing Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. The president's allies include groups such as the Committee for Justice, Focus on the Family, the Federalist Society, Americans for Tax Reform and FreedomWorks, which have not only raised millions for the purpose but coordinate their activities in conference calls among their leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an odd way, all this attention to Washington ways is heartening. The common view is that elites run the show and sheep- like citizens allow them to. In fact, organized interests able to motivate blocs of voters really can make a difference, as long as they can stick around for a while.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, not every vital issue has a group or groups that are clever or rich enough to generate unrelenting support from back home. That leaves out of the mix too many people with worthy woes: the unemployed, the uninsured, the unaligned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's probably an opportunity there for yet another powerful interest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Author's e-mail:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kstreetconfidential@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jeffrey Birnbaum is a Post reporter whose</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>K Street Confidential column on the intersection of business and politics appears on alternate Mondays in the Business section.

I am grateful to the State Transportation Department for putting together for me an accounting of how much has been spent so far on the court-stalled Westway project and who has received the money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Transportation Department has been in charge of overseeing the 4.2-mile superhighway-waterfront development to replace the crumbled West Side Highway in lower Manhattan - a construction opus that was once estimated to cost $1.4 billion but is now projected at $4 billion or more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To date, the state agency reported, $75 million has been spent, out of $100 million authorized, on the preliminary planning and construction work - and much more is to come. The last time an accounting of this groundwork spending appeared in public print - in a story in this newspaper four years ago - the figure was only $18 million out of the $21 million allocated - so the engineers and consultants and contractors have been, so to speak, active.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ninety percent of the money has come from the Federal Highway Trust Fund and 10 percent from the state - which has led some of the promoters of the project to behave as if it will cost us next to nothing. But there is no guarantee from Congress that the rest of the project would be fully funded by this 90-10 formula; the indications, in fact, have been to the contrary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I felt it would be instructive if I reproduced here the salient portions of the Transportation Department's spending list. Because of the length of that list, I chose half a million dollars as the cutoff point; those consultants who have received less should not feel slighted at being omitted here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas and subcontractors - the main engineers for the project ... $24,833,500 System Design Concepts and subcontractors - the main consultants, who became part of the state government and directed the project until recently ... $8,671,707</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mueser, Rutledge, Johnston & DeSimone - soil engineers ...  $6,163,184</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hardesty & Hanover/Andrews & Clark (joint venture) - preliminary engineering designs ... $698,000</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ammann & Whitney - preliminary engineering designs ... $712,400 Howard, Needles, Tammen & Bergendorff - preliminary engineering designs ... $858,472 The Port Authority - monitor of a test boring and design consultant work regarding Authority facilities ... $595,625 Warren George Inc. - contractor for test borings ... $2,900,862 Clarke & Rapuano/Venturi Rauch & Scott Brown (joint venture ) - landscape architects for park design ... $995,671 R.T.P.

The lessons here are instructive. The ballot measure claimed to end \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d in state schools. It resulted in a 25% reduction in Black student enrollment at state colleges and universities \u2014 the largest decline among all groups. Two decades later, UC\u2019s Black enrollment is about 5%; it was slightly more than 7% pre-Prop. 209.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the executive director of Black College Success \u2014 a community-based nonprofit that provides academic pathways to colleges and universities for hundreds of Black students in South Los Angeles \u2014 I\u2019m forced to reckon with the difficulty of improving such statistics. You should know that 75% of Black students from the Los Angeles Unified School District don\u2019t enroll in and 85% don\u2019t graduate from a four-year college or university. They come from communities where the median family income is less than $48,000 a year, and where less than 10% of community members have a college degree.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite these terrible odds, in May, the Black College Success team celebrated the admission of 208 students to more than 40 colleges and universities, including prestigious institutions such as Stanford, Pepperdine, Pitzer, Tulane and New York University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was far from easy for these students. For instance, Jackson, 18 and headed to a competitive school in the northeast, grew up in a single-parent household with a hardworking father who drives for Amazon, faced the challenges of being a Black man in L.A., avoiding gang life and supporting his siblings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ajaa, 17, will be a freshman at an HBCU \u2014 a historically Black college or university \u2014 in Georgia. She won more than $100,000 in scholarships while working part time to support her family, including take care of her younger brother so that her mother could attend school too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We\u2019re not only trying to shatter the boundaries Black students from South Los Angeles face in gaining access to college, but to also help make clear the transformative opportunity that college offers their families financially for the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the students we work with will be the first in their families to go to college. And our help doesn\u2019t stop there. To get them to graduation (our first cohort hasn\u2019t yet reached that milestone), we follow them wherever they enroll, with continued counseling about class choices and majors and career possibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, how do we do it? And how will we do it in a post-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> world?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There\u2019s just one way: one student at a time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the work of finding and recruiting high schoolers for the program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning as early as sophomore year (as we continue to expand, we\u2019ll eventually work with students starting the moment they enter high school), a team of \u201ccollege access managers,\u201d who are from the same neighborhoods as our students and have backgrounds in college recruitment, go into our partner high schools, which have expressed an interest in working with us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The managers figuratively and literally meet the students where they are and offer them an array of supports, starting with academic planning assistance for their A-G requirements, the classes students must complete with a grade of C or better to be eligible to enter the Cal State or UC systems. No matter where students apply, the A-G standards are an objective demonstration that they\u2019re college ready.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At times, the students\u2019 need for mentoring is far greater than our capacity, so we partner with in-school resources, such as the newly created Black Student Achievement Program, and lock arms with other nonprofits like Brotherhood Crusade, 826LA, Los Angeles Urban League and others that can help us provide writing workshops, access to advanced courses and a range of extracurricular activities, stipends for summer internships, career guidance and scholarships.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once our students become seniors, they receive one-on-one college application assistance, personal statement workshops and financial aid advice. We take them on college and university visits and help them evaluate their choices. Our aim is to provide them with everything they need to level the landscape against peers who often enjoy significant advantages, such as private tutors and schools with more funding and resources than those in South L.A.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In doing this work, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not how high a student\u2019s GPA is or how impressive their test scores are that gets results.

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}

Not always, not everywhere -- and not, apparently, here in Chicago, where one family, the Daleys, has controlled the political action from City Hall for going on four decades. Richard J. Daley, or Daley pere, was mayor of the city from 1955 to 1976, and died in office; Richard M. Daley, or Daley fils, began his run in 1989, and it begins to look as if I, who am five years his elder, am quite likely to die while he is still in office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From time to time a local politician makes a noise suggesting that he would like to make a run at the Daley dynasty, as by now it must be reckoned. Most recently, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., who does a fair impression of a serious politician -- unlike his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who does a very poor imitation of Martin Luther King Jr. -- has criticized Daley fils for yet another of the small- and large-bore scandals -- this one having to do with <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> contracts -- that are as indispensable to Chicago politics as nitrogen to plant life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Jackson is on record as saying, \"I am concerned about the reports of rampant corruption and fraud and abuse in the city. I'm interested in our city restoring honesty and integrity in our government.\" (Pause here for chortle followed by yawn.) He also insists that he has no intention of opposing Daley fils in his run for his sixth term as mayor in 2007, though he wouldn't rule it out. (Pause here for raised left eyebrow followed by cynical smile.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet whoever might run against him in 2007 -- even if candidates were to include a combined reincarnation of Winston Churchill, Gandhi, Disraeli, and the Archangel Michael -- Daley fils will be, as they say in Vegas, a prohibitive favorite. To be sure, he has done some very high-handed things in office; the most impressive of all in this line was plowing up Meigs Field, the city's small downtown lakeshore airport the survival of which everyone else thought was still up for discussion, and doing it, as the mystery writers like to say, by dark of night. But most Chicagoans don't seem to hold any of it against him. Hey, the kid's OK.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corruption, like sexual satisfaction, is relative. Corruption under Daley pere was widespread and wide open. Everything that passed through City Hall was for sale: health and building inspectors, cops, judges, even in one notorious instance -- the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon presidential election -- the White House. (I first heard the motto \"Vote early, vote often\" during this election, where it was more a modus operandi than a mere motto.) Some people see corruption as intrinsic to, if not inherent in, big-city government, and I'm afraid that I happen to be one of them, but then I'm an American, like the man said, Chicago-born.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one has ever accused the Daleys, father or son, of being thieves. Their interest has never been in money -- only in what money can do to smooth the way to power, which for them has always been the real point and prize of politics. Critics of Rich Daley -- the father was known as Dick, a harder name for a more obdurate man -- say that politics in Chicago under him is business as usual. I don't believe this is quite so, but in any case if corruption has gone on during his administrations, he at least has provided real compensations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chicago was once a city distinguished by having not one but two skid rows: one on south State Street, the other on west Madison. Under Rich Daley both have been replaced by charming neighborhoods lived in for the most part by the go-go young. Once drab and dreary neighborhoods show new buildings, lots of rehab, and Starbucks as far as the eye can see. Where squalor once was, youthful gentry now reside.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everywhere around the city flowers and trees have been planted. The new Millennium Park, with its Frank Gehry outdoor concert hall, skating rink, modern sculptures, charming walkways, and fields for lolling is a great hit with everyone who has seen it. The Chicago of my youth, filled with gruff cigar-smoking pols in size 48 suits, suddenly seems a city for the young, who appear delighted to be in a city with so much to offer and themselves lend the metropolis a winning liveliness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Between the Daleys, especially when Harold Washington and his successor Eugene Sawyer, both black men, were in office, racial feeling in the city was raw and the confrontations between blacks and whites in the City Council was ugly. Rich Daley has done a good deal to eliminate that. No one, I think, would say that he is in the least racist. Cliche though it sounds, he really does seem to want to be the mayor of all Chicagoans. In the 2003 four-candidate mayoral election, he won 79% of the vote, though voter turnout was down to only 34%, expressing either satisfaction or voter apathy, or (most likely) confidence that he was unbeatable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rich Daley appears to have no theory of government, but merely a boundless appetite for governing. He is a fix-it, a problem-solving, man, treating the city of Chicago as if it were an unending episode of \"This Old House\" -- and he seems to be turning the old heap into a damn stately mansion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps the real secret behind the Daley family success is the fixed but limited ambition of both father and son. Neither Dick nor Rich Daley ever aspired to rise any higher than Mayor of the City of Chicago. Dick Daley, doubtless, enjoyed being a kingmaker and a power in the Democratic Party; this would appear to be less true of Rich Daley, but then the age of king-making Democratic Party bosses seems to be over. A homeboy, the current mayor does not wish to become governor or a U.S. senator, or -- here's a thought to pass on to the search committee in Cambridge -- the next president of Harvard. That goes a good way to explaining why he is so good at his job and why he is likely to be able to keep it for as long as he likes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Epstein is the author, most recently, of \"Envy\" (Oxford, 2003).</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 47s "}}

Your career helped shaped the modern-day Golden State.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a career mostly defined by a moderate approach -- an important lesson for the Democrats and Republicans of today that too few bother to remember.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a mayoral career that saw you protect San Diego's wetlands and implement <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> hiring practices. \"He believes that America's minorities have been handicapped for years,\" one campaign flier read, \"by inadequate housing, education and job opportunities, and he has dedicated his efforts to alleviating these problems.\" That's a reality that more Republicans should acknowledge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for being so hurt when the Republican Party pulled their 1972 convention from San Diego that you responded with an \"America's Finest City\" campaign. You showed second-tier cities across the country that they too should be proud of who they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for proving that Republicans can take the lead in addressing America's prior racial wrongs. As senator, you cosponsored the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which granted reparations and an official government apology to Japanese Americans interned during World War II.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for showing us that a Republican governor could understand that raising taxes to help shore up public finances was a wise thing and not treason. In 1991, when California faced a record deficit, you backed tax increases for sales, the wealthy and even snacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias too for throwing away this record of centrism. (Just bear with me.) You showed future generations of politicians how not to ruin their legacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for helping to deregulate California's electricity, which led to mass blackouts in the beginning of the 2000s and convinced an entire generation that we shouldn't leave public utilities to the private market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for signing the state's three-strikes sentencing laws. The increase in prisoners proved that justice isn't blind but usually racist and always classist, and it planted the first seeds of distrust in law enforcement that have bloomed into a movement across the state today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for working so hard to eliminate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> at the University of California and beyond. The program helped to get thousands of minorities into the middle class, where they promptly retreated into the comforts of whiteness. Your 180-degree turn on the issue radicalized college students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, most of all, for Proposition 187. You didn't author the 1994 measure, which declared war on immigrants in the country illegally and the people who helped them. But you jumped on the 187 bandwagon and took the reins as soon as you could to help resurrect your flagging reelection campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, Mexican Americans like me realized for the first time that a large part of society still considered us \"Mexican\" and not \"American,\" like we always believed ourselves to be. Most of us have identified with the former more than the latter ever since.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, MEChA bounced back. The Chicano high school and college group was slowly losing its power as more Mexican Americans began to identify as \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\" and wanted no part with radical politics. Because of 187, MEChA members went on to reinvigorate the labor movement, introduce ethnic studies in high schools, and make Dia de los Muertos a thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring Latinos to enter politics like never before. And gracias for making the defense of immigrants their rallying cry. From state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra's zeal, to bringing back driver's licenses for the undocumented (which you took away), to declaring us a sanctuary state, it's all a direct response to your cynicism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring two of the most hilarious death-metal songs ever: \"Matando Gueros\" (\"Killing White People\") and \"Raza Odiada\" (\"Hated Race\"), both by Brujeria. I certainly hope that you take their mock-assassination skit as satire at its finest, instead of a bona fide threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for providing the California Republican Party a cautionary tale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inadvertently posing for an airplane selfie two years ago with film director Alex Rivera. Your befuddled expression reminded Latinos that you're not a monster but rather just a confused fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And gracias for still not getting it.

And as news it's not in the same league as the total war waged against Harvard president Lawrence Summers for having had the temerity to suggest that factors in addition to prejudice might have something to do with the under-representation of women in math and the sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, what happened at Purdue is a pungent reminder of all that's possible now in the rarefied ideological atmosphere on our college campuses -- and in this presidential election year, not perhaps only on our campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story began prosaically enough. Keith Sampson, a student employee on the janitorial staff earning his way toward a degree, was in the habit of reading during work breaks. Last October he was immersed in \"Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson was in short order visited by his union representative, who informed him he must not bring this book to the break room, and that he could be fired. Taking the book to the campus, Mr. Sampson says he was told, was \"like bringing pornography to work.\" That it was a history of the battle students waged against the Klan in the 1920s in no way impressed the union rep.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The assistant <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer who next summoned the student was similarly unimpressed. Indeed she was, Mr. Sampson says, irate at his explanation that he was, after all, reading a scholarly book. \"The Klan still rules Indiana,\" Marguerite Watkins told him -- didn't he know that? Mr. Sampson, by now dazed, pointed out that this book was carried in the university library. Yes, she retorted, you can get Klan propaganda in the library.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university has allowed no interviews with Ms. Watkins or any other university official involved in the case. Still, there can be no disputing the contents of the official letter that set forth the university's case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson stood accused of \"openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your Black co-workers.\" The statement, signed by chief <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer Lillian Charleston, asserted that her office had completed its investigation of the charges brought by Ms. Nakea William, his co- worker -- that Mr. Sampson had continued, despite complaints, to read a book on this \"inflammatory topic.\" \"We conclude,\" the letter informed him, \"that your conduct constitutes racial harassment. . . .\" A very serious matter, with serious consequences, it went on to point out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was in November. Months later, in February of this year, Mr. Sampson received -- from the same source -- a letter with an astonishingly transformed version of his offense. And there could be no mystery as to the cause of this change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the official judgment against him, Mr. Sampson turned to Indiana state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, whose office contacted university attorneys. Worse, the case got some sharp local press coverage that threatened to get wider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ludicrous harassment cases are not rare at our institutions of higher learning. But there was undeniably something special -- something pure, and glorious -- in the clarity of this picture. A university had brought a case against a student on grounds of a book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so the new letter to Mr. Sampson by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer Charleston brought word that she wished to clarify her previous letter, and to say it was \"permissible for him to read scholarly books or other materials on break time.\" About the essential and only theme of the first letter -- the \"racially abhorrent\" subject of the book -- or the warnings that any \"future substantiated conduct of a similar nature could mean serious disciplinary action\" -- there was not a word. She had meant in that first letter, she said, only to address \"conduct\" that caused concern among his co-workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What that conduct was, the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer did not reveal -- but she had delivered the message rewriting the history of the case. Absolutely and for certain there had been no problem about any book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This, indeed, was now the official story -- as any journalist asking about the case would learn instantly from the university's media relations representatives. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved -- if not much -- by the extraordinary efforts of these tormented agents trying to explain that the first letter was all wrong: No reading of any book had anything to do with the charges against Mr. Sampson. This means, I asked one, that Mr. Sampson could have been reading about the adventures of Jack and Jill and he still would have been charged? Yes. What, then, was the offense? \"Harassing behavior.\" While reading the book? The question led to careful explanations hopeless in tone -- for good reason -- and well removed from all semblance of reason. What the behavior was, one learned, could never be revealed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was, of course, no other offensive behavior; had there been any it would surely have appeared in the first letter's gusher of accusation. Like those prosecutors who invent new charges when the first ones fail in court, the administrators threw in the mysterious harassment count. Such were the operations of the university's guardians of equity and justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In April -- having been pressed by the potent national watchdog group FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) as well as the ACLU -- University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz finally sent them a letter expressing regret over this affair, and testifying to his profound commitment to freedom of expression. So far as can be ascertained, the university has extended no such expressions of regret to Keith Sampson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This case and all its kind are worth bearing in mind for anyone pondering the hypersensitivity surrounding the issue of race today. The mindset that produces those harassment courts, those super-heated capacities for perceiving insult, is not limited to college campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its presence is evident in this election campaign, which has seen more than a touch of readiness to impute some form of racism to all tough criticisms of Barack Obama. The deranged response that greeted Bill Clinton's remark that certain of Sen. Obama's claims were \"a fairy tale,\" told the story. No need to go into the now famous catalogue of accusations about the Clintons' \"sly racist\" tactics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There will be much more ahead, directed to the Republicans and their candidate. Some more, no doubt, about the Willie Horton ad of 1988, whose status as a quintessential piece of racism is -- except for a few rare voices of reason -- accepted throughout our media as revealed truth. To be sure, the Willie Horton charge has for some time been over-shadowed by ominous predictions of all the Swiftboating Republicans are supposed to be readying.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Obama himself, the candidate of racial transcendence, has now taken a plunge of sorts to old-style race politics. In a preemptive dismissal of future criticism, he warned a Florida audience on June 20, of the racist tactics the Republicans planned. \"We know the strategy,\" he said. Republicans planned to make people afraid of him. They'd say \"he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this may be far from the world of the universities. But to those aforementioned campus ideologues, the thinking is familiar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Correction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yesterday's op-ed article by Dorothy Rabinowitz, \"American Politics Aren't 'Post-Racial',\" misstated the name of the university.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2236765173.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>How to Save Affirmative Action</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton Administration's reversal of position on a case that could be one of the most important of the Supreme Court's coming term has disappointed supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. But given the tenor of the Court's recent decisions on racial preferences, the Administration has made a smart strategic move to preserve what can and should be saved of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case concerns the decision of the Piscataway, N.J., school board to promote racial diversity by laying off a white teacher so that it could preserve the job of an equally qualified black teacher. Though the Administration had previously supported the school board, the brief it filed with the Supreme Court on Aug. 23 concedes that the board violated the civil rights of the white teacher.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In previous rulings, the Court has maintained that government use of racial preferences is constitutional only when such action is necessary to remedy a history of overt discrimination, or when the public goal being pursued is ''compelling.'' Moreover, the Court has said, the use of racial preferences must be ''narrowly tailored'' to meet the particular goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appellate court that heard the Piscataway case declared, in effect, that racial diversity could never be a compelling state interest. Should the Supreme Court completely uphold the appellate court's ruling, the use of race in decisions about hiring and firing public employees could, for all practical purposes, be prohibited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Piscataway case, the avowed goal -- racial diversity within a single, small department of an otherwise diverse faculty -- does not seem ''compelling.'' And the way the school board chose to pursue its goal of diversity -- dismissing a white teacher solely because of her race -- was not ''narrowly tailored.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By acknowledging this, yet at the same time making a broader argument for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, the Administration hopes to preserve some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring. The approach it has suggested in its brief is essentially a compromise. Even if the Piscataway school board was wrong in this specific instance in its use of racial preference, the Administration argues, there is still a place for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and not only to remedy past discrimination. Indeed, as it points out in its brief, there are times when taking race into account is the only way to further compelling public goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A police department, for example, may need to recruit a diverse officer corps to carry on effective undercover work or to retain public confidence in neighborhoods where there are racial tensions. At schools and colleges, a diverse faculty may, through the example of its own collegiality, teach students important lessons about working across racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the absolutist opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> have the upper hand, in the courts as well as in the broader public debate. California now outlaws the use of race in public hiring, contracting and education. And in a case challenging <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> at the University of Texas Law School, a Federal appeals court ruled last year that racial diversity in a student body could never constitute a compelling state interest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court declined to review that decision, but in taking on the Piscataway case, the Court has the opportunity to clarify the question of when, if ever, it is legitimate to use <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> to achieve racial diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a grave error for the Court to adopt an absolutist color-blind view on the question of whether race should ever be a factor in decisions about public employment. Moreover, it is impossible to maintain such absolutism and still uphold a commitment to prevent racial discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider efforts to recruit job applicants that are directed toward minority candidates -- as when companies send recruiters to heavily black schools when blacks are underrepresented in their work force. Such efforts would clearly violate the color-blind principle. Even when the final hiring decision is made solely on the basis of an applicant's qualifications, without regard to race, these recruitment programs involve discrimination because they bestow the benefits of better job information and a greater number of alternative job offers on some individuals solely because of their race. Yet these programs are widespread in both the public and the private sectors, and they are needed to prevent discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to public employment, the Administration makes a strong case for considering race. Indeed, its argument could also be applied to the lifetime appointments to the Federal courts that interpret the constitutionality of race-based state action. The legitimacy of court rulings in this area would surely be undermined by the absence from the bench of nonwhite members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't mean that racial quotas should be used for judicial appointments. But as far as the Federal judiciary is concerned, there is a compelling public interest in racial diversity for its own sake. Perhaps the Justices who decide the Piscataway case will have the wisdom to see this point.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2065768718.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>This Is No Time for Liberal Despair</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fight over President Trump\u2019s second Supreme Court nominee is going to feel frustrating for Democrats. Not long after stealing one Supreme Court seat, Republicans will have a chance to fill a second and move the court further to the right.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the confirmation process could still turn out to be productive for Democrats \u2014 or it could become the worst of all worlds, both frustrating and damaging. The key now for the party and its voters is to understand the difference between those outcomes. Here\u2019s a three-step guide to doing so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step one: Be realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump\u2019s nominee is overwhelmingly likely to be confirmed regardless of what actions Democrats take. Republicans hold the Senate majority, and every Republican senator \u2014 yes, including Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski \u2014 has a history of voting for judges like those Trump is considering. Collins and Murkowski have a script: They make centrist-sounding statements, to shore up their images, and then vote aye.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So Democrats should go into the confirmation debate recognizing that it is almost certainly unwinnable. It will not depend on how hard Democratic leaders fight or which tactics they choose, alluring as that fantasy may be. In these polarized times, court nominations unite political parties, even more than individual issues, like, say, health care.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, Senator Elizabeth Warren called the coming nomination \u201cthe fight of our lives.\u201d It is not. The great political fights are still ahead. When a new justice is sworn in this fall, Democrats should not declare generational defeat or turn on each other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step two: Don\u2019t lose hope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol has spent decades studying political power and change, from the Civil War to the Tea Party and anti-Trump resistance. She believes that Kennedy\u2019s retirement can be a clarifying moment for American liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the last half-century, conservatives have put more energy into building a movement \u2014 creating ideological institutions, grooming judges and, perhaps above all, winning local, state and congressional elections. Democrats have emphasized higher-profile politics, like the presidency and landmark court cases. Democrats can\u2019t afford to do so anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years to come, the Supreme Court is likely to have a very conservative majority. But remember that the modern conservative movement began when the court seemed implacably liberal, under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and \u201960s. \u201cConservatives were facing a Washington complex that horrified them,\u201d Skocpol told me, \u201cso they built from the bottom up.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember, too, the limits of the court\u2019s power. On some big issues, the court is not imposing right-wing policies on the entire country. It is instead refusing to ban state-based right-wing policies \u2014 like abortion restrictions and partisan gerrymandering \u2014 that progressives consider unconstitutional. (And, by the way, the court was already doing so with Kennedy .)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Progressives can still win many of these issues. They simply will have to do so in a small-d democratic way, by winning elections \u2014 as they\u2019ve begun to do lately . If Democrats win more governorships and state legislatures, they can keep Republicans from drawing ridiculous congressional maps and infringing on African-Americans\u2019 voting rights \u2014 among many other things. If Democrats retake Congress this fall, they can halt the Republican legislative agenda and gain subpoena power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I realize that a post-Kennedy Supreme Court may one day start throwing out progressive legislation, as happened in the early 20th century. But that\u2019s a fight for another day. Most experts I\u2019ve talked to \u2014 scholars and people in politics \u2014 believe that elected politicians can prevail in a long-term struggle with unelected judges. Regardless, until Democrats win more elections, it\u2019s a hypothetical concern. \u201cThe potential center-left majority in this country \u2014 and it\u2019s very real \u2014 has to actually organize and elect people to office,\u201d Skocpol says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step three: Know your strengths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democrats will be tempted to turn the next two months into a national conversation about abortion, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and other social issues that inspire liberal passion. That would be a mistake. Those are not the best issues for Democrats during a midterm campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The best issues are those on which Democrats hold a decisive advantage in public opinion . Health insurance is a good example. So are taxation, corporate power and the Trump administration\u2019s corruption. All of these issues can be grist for a nominee\u2019s Senate hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I\u2019m not suggesting that Democratic senators ignore social issues. They just shouldn\u2019t fool themselves into thinking that the country is further to the left than it is . For instance, about two-thirds of Americans believe abortion should be illegal at least sometimes, according to Gallup , and many of the strongest opponents base their votes on the issue. That\u2019s why Republicans are happy to have these arguments .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nothing in American politics matters more right now than the outcome of the midterms. It is the difference between emboldening Trump and starting to hold him accountable. It really may be \u201cthe fight of our lives.\u201d And unlike the confirmation battle, the midterms remain up for grabs. In the coming weeks, Democrats will be talking about the Supreme Court, but they should be thinking about the midterms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: David Leonhardt</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 49s "}}
