Few experts in the press or academe wanted to probe this most politically incorrect topic until Louisiana's David Duke seized the issue and became a political force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>General population polls conducted by Gordon Black Associates in 1984 and by the National Opinion Research Center in 1990 suggest that 1-in-10 white men has been injured by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. This figure alone adds up to millions. Circumstantial evidence suggests even larger numbers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Preferential policies were instituted during an intensely competitive era when huge cohorts of baby boomers crowded job markets increasingly constrained by international competition, lean-and-mean downsizing movements, and tax revolts. Thus, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> often occurred in zero-sum contexts; someone was quota-ed in at another's expense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My research indicates that reverse discrimination's bite has varied by age, geography, occupation, and private or public sector. Most vulnerable have been public-sector white men under the age of 45 with people-oriented skills. Their phone calls flood radio talk-show programs on this topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many more white men may not have been fully aware that they were being injured by behind-the-scenes tactics such as \"race-norming\" of employment tests by public testing agencies, and many private ones. (The EEOC only recently stopped pressuring corporations to use such procedures.)

''We expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her 5-to-4 majority opinion last week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the justices have in the past said that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should not be used forever, never before has a justice placed a specific time limit on it. Having now done so, Justice O'Connor has raised tough questions, both broad and specific.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are her views merely idle musings, or will they become an iron-clad legal principle? Should the goal be parity in graduation rates of white, black and Hispanic high school students? Or should it be equality in financing between poor school districts, which tend to have more minority students, and middle-class white ones? Can the gap between black and white students on the SAT be bridged in the next generation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In The Chicago Tribune, Justice O'Connor said in a rare interview that the country can tackle many of these challenges. ''I hope it looks as though we don't need artificial help to fill our classrooms with highly qualified students at the graduate level,'' she said. ''And if we do our job on educating young people, we can reach that goal.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But closing the disparities in educational achievement and opportunities for college applicants across racial and ethnic lines will involve vociferous debate over the relative importance of school financing, social inequality and student study habits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Statistics tell the story. On every major indicator of academic success -- the SAT, the A.C.T. and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (given to elementary and secondary students) -- the gap between white and minority students has persisted for decades. Though it narrowed somewhat on the national assessment exams from the 1980's through the early 90's, the divide has only widened since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''There is some serious heavy lifting to do before we get to the dream scenario Justice O'Connor is envisioning,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and an assistant secretary of education in the Reagan administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some liberals say the gap can be closed only by equalizing the amount of money spent on educating whites and minorities. The school districts that many blacks and Hispanics attend spend $902 less per student on average than mostly white districts, according to a national study conducted last year by the Education Trust, a group focused on closing the achievement gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some degree, federal and state governments can, and do, try to fix this imbalance by sending more money to schools serving poor -- and, by extension, disproportionately minority -- students. Federal assistance for poor students is increasing, and state governments gave an average of $27 more per pupil to disproportionately minority schools in 2000 than to predominately white schools, though that hardly had a perceptible impact on the financing gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if federal and state lawmakers were bent on eliminating the financial discrepancies between white and minority districts, they couldn't have much affect. On average, states and the federal government have never accounted for more than 56 percent of schools' revenues over the last decade or so; the remainder has come from local sources, mostly property taxes. This financial structure makes parity unlikely at best.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And conservatives argue that the focus on financial parity misses the point, and point to some minority-dominated city school districts that have high spending per student but still lag well behind less flush districts, particularly in rural areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, educational parity may be linked to bigger, more complex economic factors. Most beneficiaries of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> are middle-income. According to a study by Anthony Carnevale, vice president of the Educational Testing Service, 74 percent of students at the 146 most prestigious colleges and universities -- where competition for admissions is most intense and where <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is practiced -- come from families in the top 25 percent of the nation's socioeconomic scale (as measured by income, educational attainment and occupations of the parents). Only 3 percent of the students at these highly selective schools come from the bottom 25 percent of the socioeconomic scale. As Lani Guinier, a law professor at Harvard University, puts it, ''<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is less an escalator up than it is a bridge across.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even middle-class black and Hispanic children who are burdened with issues of crime, troubled homes and poor schools have not been able to close the test-score gap with their white counterparts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The gap persists across all income levels,'' said Freeman Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, who has written extensively on improving the academic achievement of black students. ''We're talking about generations of habits in too many homes,'' said Mr. Hrabowski, who is black. ''Unfortunately, reading is not the No. 1 priority as a habit. There is much more emphasis on television watching.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both sides on the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> issue agree on the need to close the education gap, but not much else. Some supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hope that Justice O'Connor's 25-year time frame will protect <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> while the country makes headway in closing that rift.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the decision last week does not invalidate laws in California and Washington State that ban the use of race in public university admissions, hiring and government contracting. Ward Connerly, the black California businessman who was the force behind passing those laws, has already vowed to make Michigan his next target.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demographic pressures will also come into play. The Educational Testing Service estimates that from 1995 to 2015, the percentage of whites on college campuses will decline from 71 percent to 63 percent, while Hispanics will increase to 15 percent, from the current 11 percent, with blacks holding steady at 13 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with minorities making up a larger proportion of students going to college -- and with the children of young immigrants approaching college age toward the end of Justice O'Connor's 25-year target -- Hispanic and black parents may be clamoring even more forcefully that their children not be shut out of top schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the debate has not changed. Opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> will continue to say that such programs keep the country from focusing on what needs to be done -- namely, helping minority students meet higher standards. The supporters of race preferences counter that the country cannot end <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> without first fixing the education system. All agree that unless a commitment is made -- by society and minority families themselves -- the old arguments will still be around in 25 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lisa Navarette, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said, ''If all we do over the 25 years is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, then we will still need <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, 1964: The University of Michigan Law School yearbook reflects the times.

Only 3 percent of the students at these highly selective schools come from the bottom 25 percent of the socioeconomic scale. As Lani Guinier, a law professor at Harvard University, puts it, ''<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is less an escalator up than it is a bridge across.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even middle-class black and Hispanic children who are burdened with issues of crime, troubled homes and poor schools have not been able to close the test-score gap with their white counterparts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The gap persists across all income levels,'' said Freeman Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, who has written extensively on improving the academic achievement of black students. ''We're talking about generations of habits in too many homes,'' said Mr. Hrabowski, who is black. ''Unfortunately, reading is not the No. 1 priority as a habit. There is much more emphasis on television watching.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both sides on the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> issue agree on the need to close the education gap, but not much else. Some supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hope that Justice O'Connor's 25-year time frame will protect <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> while the country makes headway in closing that rift.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the decision last week does not invalidate laws in California and Washington State that ban the use of race in public university admissions, hiring and government contracting. Ward Connerly, the black California businessman who was the force behind passing those laws, has already vowed to make Michigan his next target.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demographic pressures will also come into play. The Educational Testing Service estimates that from 1995 to 2015, the percentage of whites on college campuses will decline from 71 percent to 63 percent, while Hispanics will increase to 15 percent, from the current 11 percent, with blacks holding steady at 13 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with minorities making up a larger proportion of students going to college -- and with the children of young immigrants approaching college age toward the end of Justice O'Connor's 25-year target -- Hispanic and black parents may be clamoring even more forcefully that their children not be shut out of top schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the debate has not changed. Opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> will continue to say that such programs keep the country from focusing on what needs to be done -- namely, helping minority students meet higher standards. The supporters of race preferences counter that the country cannot end <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> without first fixing the education system. All agree that unless a commitment is made -- by society and minority families themselves -- the old arguments will still be around in 25 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lisa Navarette, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said, ''If all we do over the 25 years is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, then we will still need <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, 1964: The University of Michigan Law School yearbook reflects the times.
