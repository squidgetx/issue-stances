He is telling us that were he not such an empathetic and benevolent president, African Americans would be far worse off. He suggests that no other president has shown such generosity to a group of people as helpless as we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I now know the cause of my indignation. Trump sounds like a slave master proclaiming that he is good to his Negroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To keep their slaves submissive, the masters would threaten to sell them to less compassionate owners if they got out of line. \"I have done more for the Black community\" sounds like a slave owner claiming that he's a good master because he doesn't beat his slaves as often or cut off their feet to stop them from fleeing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a racist, self-gratifying pronouncement that was passed down through generations of prominent white people who held power over African Americans. It was prevalent in the South during the 1960s, when Black women largely were domestic workers cleaning homes and caring for the children of white employers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was not uncommon for a white woman to brag to her friends about how good she was to her help. Though she paid wages too small to live on, she rewarded her \"girl\" with items from her home -- discarded furniture, clothing and trinkets that Black people struggling to put food on the table would never buy for themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump wants us to understand that even the first Black president, Barack Obama, couldn't fix our problems. Only someone like him -- white with an abundance of intellect -- could lead us to the Promised Land. But there's only so much he can do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's comments reflect the racist, stereotypical attitude he and others in his circle espouse about the Black community. He sees African Americans as violently barbaric people and describes our neighborhoods as \"living in hell.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has written us off as too dumb to understand how we have created these conditions ourselves. And he is losing patience with us because we refuse to acknowledge all that he does for us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, expressed it more bluntly. Appearing Monday on \"Fox & Friends,\" Kushner brought up the old racist adage that Black people can't succeed to the heights of white people because they don't want to be successful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"One thing we've seen in a lot of the Black community, which is mostly Democrat, is that President Trump's policies are the policies that can help people break out of the problems that they're complaining about,\" said Kushner, a top White House adviser. \"But he can't want them to be successful more than they want to be successful.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kushner went on to suggest that African Americans would rather complain than do what is necessary to improve their lives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, the white savior in the Oval Office has broken his back trying to help Black people, while we are being lazy and shiftless. This came from someone who came up in his father's business and is only in his prominent position because he is married to the president's daughter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The hypocrisy of both Kushner and Trump, who inherited wealth from his father, is astounding. It shows complete ignorance when it comes to the interplay between race and economics in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It overlooks the impressive achievements of large numbers of African Americans in spite of a system that historically has offered little or no assistance. It also ignores that this same system has successfully fought to tear down equalizers such as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> that sought to provide a bridge to economic parity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Speaking at Stanford University in 2017, Harvard University sociologist William Julius Wilson pointed out that the income of more affluent African Americans was increasing prior to Trump taking office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When adjusted for inflation, the percentage of African Americans earning at least $75,000 more than doubled to 21% from 1970 to 2014, he said. Those making $100,000 or more nearly quadrupled to 13%. In contrast, white Americans saw a less impressive increase, from 11 to 26%, he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By no means does that indicate that African Americans have reached economic parity in this county. In fact, we remain far from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it does prove that Trump is not the savior to Black people he claims to be. More so, it shows that African Americans can do, and always have done, a lot better without him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>dglanton@chicagotribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter @dahleeng</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CREDIT: Dahleen Glanton</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 50s "}}

Eurocentric Americans who oppose reparations for historically oppressed groups can count this new census data as a victory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should not \"beat around the (George) bush\" by pretending that this transparent attempt to pass off racism as multicultural acceptance is a good thing for American society. These 57 census groups simply water down ethnic communities that have gained some degree of political power. Why are Germans who mix with Italians, who mix with Russians, who mix with British all considered \"white\" on the census? These multiethnic Americans of lighter hues have one category from which to choose and constitute one large voting bloc. Meanwhile, multiethnic Americans of darker hues are asked to divvy up 57 ways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, I am African American and have always identified myself as such. Both my parents identified themselves the same way. However, if I were to get technical--as the census invites me to get- -I would have to check the box that said \"white, black, American Indian and Alaska native.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the white in my bloodline extends from slavery via non- consensual sex, white is still evident in my skin tone. Did the census mean to count that or only count more recent consensual interracial marriages? Do \"blacks\" have to have a close white relative, be raised by one, or simply embrace everyone who has contributed to their genetic makeup in order to qualify for the \"white-black\" box?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of clarity on this question makes the data collected invalid for the purpose of drawing conclusions. However, it will succeed at destroying ethnic community voting blocs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My great-grandfather was a full-blooded Native American. Will I qualify for more services if I claim him even though I don't know his culture? I doubt it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Modern political and economic forecasting is done through socio- economic lines more so than racial lines in today's culture. Perhaps we should abandon race identification altogether and inquire only about religion, education and income levels, all of which give us equally important information without race-baiting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until the government clarifies the political need for these new 57 categories, all ethnic groups should continue to identify with the established traditional race categories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whites are not asked to divide their community into 57 multiethnic groups to better represent their diversity, so minority groups should not be asked to do so either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Felicia Clark is an educator with the Compton Unified School District</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 53s "}}

They then invoked an obscure Senate rule that required the judicial candidates to be re-nominated. (Yes, these are the same Republicans who used to loudly demand that every one of President George W. Bush's nominees get a vote on the Senate floor, regardless of their qualifications.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most prominent of the five repeaters is Goodwin Liu, a law professor and legal scholar who would be the only Asian-American serving as an active judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Liu went to Stanford, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and graduated from Yale Law School. He clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before beginning a teaching career at the University of California, Berkeley,  School of Law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, it is largely his stellar background that is fueling Republican opposition. Mr. Liu, who is 39, is seen as a strong possibility to be on President Obama's short list for a future Supreme Court vacancy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives do not like Mr. Liu's support for same-sex marriage rights, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and his view that the Constitution is a living document that evolves over time. But his views fall well within the legal and political mainstream. His warnings that Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel Alito would turn out to be extremely conservative were accurate. But Mr. Liu is no rigid liberal ideologue, as his support of school vouchers and charter schools attest. Kenneth Starr, the conservative lawyer who investigated President Bill Clinton, co-signed a letter vouching for Mr. Liu's \"independence and openness to diverse viewpoints.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be nice if some Republican members of the Judiciary Committee voted for Mr. Liu and the four other re-nominees (along with three other new nominees). Whether they do or not, the White House and Senate Democrats should persist in fighting for their confirmation and the confirmation of the 16 other pending nominees already approved by the committee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the comparable point in the Bush presidency, the Senate had confirmed 61.4 percent of Mr. Bush's nominees. For Mr. Obama, it's under 50 percent. His nominees are no radicals. That description applies to Republicans holding up well-qualified choices like Mr. Liu.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 32s "}}

Gavin Newsom, we have said that California\u2019s values are at stake as well. The leading Republican candidates, particularly front-runner Larry Elder, don\u2019t support the values most Californians hold dear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And what are those values? There\u2019s no official definition cast in bronze at the state Capitol in Sacramento. Values are ideas that live separately in the minds of everyone, but collectively they form a culture that embraces multiple people, communities and generations. They are given actual form in policies and goals that build a more welcoming, tolerant, prosperous, healthy and equitable state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And they are in danger. Here\u2019s how:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Protection of natural resources</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California could be just another uninspiring patch of dirt were it not for its stunning geography: sunny beaches, towering mountain ranges, gentle rolling hills, rugged coastlines, soaring forests, fertile inland valleys and breathtaking deserts. Most of the Golden State\u2019s history is a tale of exploitation of this seemingly endless abundance. Gold! Timber! Open land!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only in the last half a century have California\u2019s leaders started to rein in the predation by protecting the state\u2019s natural resources and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet many of the leading Republican recall candidates seem to have no interest in maintaining the climate or environmental goals supported by this governor and are more inclined to seek policies that would make things worse \u2014 much worse. Several candidates have said, for example, they would seek expanded oil drilling and fracking operations, encourage more logging of forests and suspend environmental rules wholesale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are already losing much of the beauty of California and its flora and fauna to the poor choices made by decades of short-sighted leadership. If we lose much more, it may not be worth saving.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, tolerance and equality</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From its early days, California has represented a meeting and mixing of peoples, a destination for risk-takers and refugees, entrepreneurs and escapees. But it hasn\u2019t been a bastion of tolerance and equality for most of its existence, as evidenced by the displacement of Indigenous communities, the embrace of the racist Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and ballot-box assaults on immigrant rights in 1994, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in 1996 and same-sex marriage in 2008. But over the last decade, California has evolved into a beacon of tolerance and equality that inspires the rest of the nation and, indeed, freedom-loving peoples everywhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the policies sometimes swing too far, such as when the Legislature banned travel by California state employees to states that passed anti-LGBTQ laws or when the governor bent over backward to ensure equity in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and ended up only temporarily delaying the rollout? ? Perhaps, but those are rare examples.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The efforts the state has taken under Newsom\u2019s leadership to reverse discriminatory polices and ensure equal access \u2014 such as reforming a criminal justice system that disproportionately affects people of color and supporting the creation of a panel to examine reparations to Californians descended from enslaved people \u2014 are at risk. We fear the state\u2019s position as a fighter against intolerance will end if Newsom is recalled, as many of the leading Republican recall candidates deny that racial discrimination and inequality even exist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Embracing democracy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Republican legislatures and governors in other U.S. states have passed laws to make it harder for citizens to vote, California has gone about as far any state to expand access to the franchise. (Colorado, which pioneered many of the voting reforms California adopted, is another.) It did this by adopting automatic registration through the Department of Motor Vehicles, same-day registration, early vote centers and generous grace periods for late ballots.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it is the misuse of the state\u2019s generous support of citizen engagement \u2014 its direct democracy system that allows the citizens to make and repeal laws, and to remove elected officials \u2014 that has led to this threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least one of the recall candidates, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), told the Los Angeles Times editorial board he supports voter ID, which is one of the main ways that Republicans in other states have sought to suppress voting among communities of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Support for the marginalized</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California is an extravagantly wealthy state. But it\u2019s also a land of searing inequality and entrenched poverty. Homeless encampments and shantytowns should be an eternal source of shame. Caring for the state\u2019s inhabitants in need, regardless of their economic situation or immigration status, is one of the most fundamental of California values.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What this means in practical terms is an expansion of the safety net such as the state has done, including providing relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring sick pay for workers and pouring billions of the state\u2019s budget surplus into programs that help and house the unsheltered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This also means continuing to reverse decades of counterproductive criminal justice efforts that have resulted in excessive sentences and crippling, unnecessary costs \u2014 on taxpayers, on communities struggling to recover from crime and on offenders who have learned their lesson and want to live responsible lives but remain stuck in prison.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom understands this. But if he is removed, would his successor? Probably not. Most of the recall candidates think the criminal justice reforms should be stopped.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do we know these are values shared by Californians? Simple. These changes did not happen organically; they were shepherded by elected officials, such as Newsom, who were supported by a majority of Californians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, what\u2019s on the recall ballot is the most important value of all: democracy.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 52s "}}
{"id": "test_question_pro_testing_1", "displayed_text": "<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

But the leaker didn\u2019t know, or wouldn\u2019t say, which way the case came out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Dreamers and their supporters, hearts would have been in their throats. This was the chief justice, after all, who two years ago wrote the opinion upholding President Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban, and who five years before that wrote the opinion dismantling the Voting Rights Act. The vote in both was 5 to 4. Why wouldn\u2019t the conservative chief justice defer to the president\u2019s decision to end a program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that his predecessor had instituted by executive action without even seeking Congress\u2019s approval?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president\u2019s allies would have had ample reason to be anxious. Wasn\u2019t this the chief justice who just a year ago wrote the majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 blocked the president\u2019s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census? The proposal failed the essential requirement of administrative law for \u201creasoned decision making,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote in that case. He dismissed the administration\u2019s proffered good-government rationale as pretextual; or, as the dictionary puts it, \u201cdubious or spurious.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, of course, we know that it was the Chief Justice Roberts of the census decision, which an enraged President Trump came within inches of defying, who arrived on the scene in time to save the Dreamers. His opinion assured readers that in holding that the administration\u2019s effort to undo DACA was invalid, the court was not endorsing the program. That is conventional administrative law talk \u2014 and the case, as the chief justice framed it, was a conventional one about administrative procedure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration\u2019s explanation for why it was terminating DACA \u2014 explained in a single sentence by an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cTaking into consideration the Supreme Court\u2019s and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated\u201d) \u2014 was so inadequate as to make the decision \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the department came up with a more elaborate explanation nine months later in response to an unfavorable Federal District Court ruling, the chief justice said that it was a \u201cfoundational principle of administrative law\u201d that an agency, once challenged, has to defend its action on the grounds it initially invoked, not on an after-the-fact rationalization, unless it wants to restart from scratch the process of arriving at a decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dry procedural language of the opinion, including its invitation to the Trump administration to start over and find a new way to defend terminating DACA, seems to have lulled many readers into assuming that the victory for the Dreamers is less than complete. No doubt many eyes had glazed over by Page 24, when the chief justice began a crucial discussion of the \u201creliance interests\u201d in favor of continuing the program that permits DACA recipients to live and work lawfully in the only country that most of them have ever known.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Citing statistics in briefs filed by, among others, a group of 143 businesses, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that those with a stake in continuing the program included not only the Dreamers themselves but also their families, \u201cincluding their 200,000 U.S.-citizen children,\u201d \u201cemployers who have invested time and money in training them\u201d and state and local governments that would lose tax revenue from DACA recipients\u2019 earnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Administrative law requires the agency to take reliance interests into account, Chief Justice Roberts said. \u201cDHS may determine, in the particular context before it, that other interests and policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMaking that difficult decision was the agency\u2019s job, but the agency failed to do it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And can the Trump administration do it now? Theoretically yes, under still another acting homeland security secretary, but any newly justified rescission announcement would find the administration back in court within hours, the clock ticking all the while toward Election Day. Although the chief justice nominally left it up to the administration to weigh the reliance interests against its policy goal, his exposition of the strength of those interests sets a very high bar for this or any subsequent administration to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where was the other Chief Justice Roberts this week, the one of the disastrous Shelby County v. Holder voting rights decision and of the travel ban decision? Was the Chief Justice Roberts who silently joined Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s majority opinion bringing L.G.B.T.Q. people within the protection of federal anti-discrimination law the same chief justice who wrote a snarky dissenting opinion five years ago when the court upheld the constitutional right to same-sex marriage?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contemplating this head-snapping week at the Supreme Court, I\u2019m reminded of the amazing 2002-2003 term, when the court under another conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist, seemed to pull its robust conservatism up short. In the space of a few weeks in the spring of 2003, the court upheld <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in higher education; granted constitutional protection to gay men and lesbians for their private sexual lives; and upheld the application of the family-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act to state employees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Rehnquist himself was in dissent in the first two of those cases, but he surprised nearly everyone by writing the majority opinion in the third, a case that may sound obscure now but that effectively spelled an end to the federalism revolution on which, under the chief justice\u2019s leadership, the court had been embarked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could have accounted for that surprising turn of events at the dawn of the new century? Wrestling with that question, I eventually concluded that the court was realigning itself, as it has done historically, with its own sense of what the public wanted and expected from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cNo great Supreme Court case is only a question of law,\u201d I wrote then. \u201cIt is always also an episode in the ongoing dialogue by which the court engages with the society in which it operates and in which the justices live.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just so with this week\u2019s cases. Monday\u2019s ruling on the right of gay and transgender people to be free of discrimination in the workplace showed a court that by a refreshing vote of 6 to 3 decided not to stand in the path of a tide of social change. The DACA decision contained a message threaded through its dry language of administrative procedure \u2014 a warning to the Trump administration not to assume that it gets a free pass, not to take the Supreme Court for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis is not the case for cutting corners,\u201d the chief justice wrote. That\u2019s a sentence sure to be echoing in the halls of the solicitor general\u2019s office, where Chief Justice Roberts once worked and where he honed his ability to speak to the Supreme Court. Now, with four colleagues to his left and four to his right, he speaks for the court from a center chair that must often feel like a lonely place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the decisions due in the next few weeks on abortion, religion, the president\u2019s tax returns and the Electoral College, among other cases, it\u2019s too soon to place a label on this pandemic-disrupted Supreme Court term. The justices will issue decisions that will infuriate, reassure, surprise and even break hearts, as they evidently broke Senator Josh Hawley\u2019s on Monday. The Missouri Republican took to the Senate floor to bemoan \u201cthe end of the conservative legal movement.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as the ambitious young senator, a former law clerk to Chief Justice Roberts, surely knows, there is no end, only a new beginning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398482848.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Cut cap gains tax, boost black jobs</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's time for the Congressional Black Caucus to support a capital gains tax cut. It may seem counterintuitive to suggest that the Caucus should support the passage of legislation that targets the rich for a tax reduction. But a meaningful capital gains tax cut will help those of us in the black community who are helping to create jobs for middle- and working-class people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Passage of a capital gains tax cut will stimulate economic growth by freeing up capital for new investments, including venture capital investments in black-controlled companies, thereby creating jobs for the constituents of CBC members. In the long run, policies that increase the availability of investment capital for entrepreneurial endeavors could completely eliminate the need for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Venture capital, which would receive a big boost from a capital gains tax cut, is a proven method of creating jobs. The most recent study by Venture One Corporation and the National Venture Capital Association found that 495 venture-capital-backed companies generated 75,240 new U.S. jobs between 1989 and 1993. It also found $2 billion of export sales were generated by the same companies. The CBC needs to become a more active and vocal advocate of the black business community in general and the flow of investment capital to black business in particular. As welfare reform increases the pressure on disadvantaged blacks in the inner cities of America, policies that stimulate black business growth are needed to provide opportunities for those coming off the welfare rolls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the moment, the private equity business, with more than $170 billion under management as of year-end 1994 (according to Private Equity Analyst estimates), flourishes with capital contributions from public pensions funds, corporate pension plans, banks and insurance companies. But very little of that capital has been directed to black firms. It is a national problem that deserves national attention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond simply cutting capital gains taxes, there are other measures the government can take to help black-owned busineses. Two initiatives come to mind, both of which can be initiated by the administration without additional legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, since the Labor Department regulates pension funds and has the responsibility to issue interpretations of regulations, Secretary Robert Reich could issue interpretations of current pension fund policies to encourage them to invest in black-owned businesses. The second initiative should be aimed at getting the brokerage industry to raise money for the black companies. With approximately $1 trillion raised each year by the U.S. brokerage industry for American businesses, it would be good business for the major brokerage firms to tap the capital markets on behalf of black businesses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But none of this is a substitute for a capital gains tax cut. The effect on black-controlled businesses would be to greatly increase the flow of venture capital in the form of equity to such businesses. This decade has seen for the first time genuine interest being expressed by the institutional investment community in making venture capital investments in black businesses. Substantially all black-controlled companies are privately held, and are precisely the type of firms that would benefit from an increased infusion of venture capital from institutions and wealthy individuals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A good indication of the impact that such investments can have on black employment lies in a 1993 Wall Street Journal survey, which found that 60% of all black businesses employ a work force at least 70% black. With a badly needed infusion of equity capital to allow them to expand, black firms would create more jobs for the substantially black constituency base of CBC members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are other benefits for the CBC in a capital gains tax cut. It would enable the lawmakers to replace the narrowly targeted broadcast properties tax incentive recently struck down by the Republican majority in Congress with a tax incentive that would benefit all industries in which black businesses operate. It would also enable the CBC to form a unique alliance with the Republican Congress to enact legislation that will help all Americans, including black Americans. Such an alliance would position the CBC as a dynamic voting bloc and its members as leaders able to deliver for their constituents by skillfully adapting to the changing political environment. This would most certainly increase the value of the CBC vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Granger is president of Ark Capital Management in Chicago.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/432415722.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Fixing the Race Gap in 25 Years or Less</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE Supreme Court decision upholding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in university admissions seemed to carry an expiration date. ''We expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her 5-to-4 majority opinion last week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the justices have in the past said that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should not be used forever, never before has a justice placed a specific time limit on it. Having now done so, Justice O'Connor has raised tough questions, both broad and specific.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are her views merely idle musings, or will they become an iron-clad legal principle? Should the goal be parity in graduation rates of white, black and Hispanic high school students? Or should it be equality in financing between poor school districts, which tend to have more minority students, and middle-class white ones? Can the gap between black and white students on the SAT be bridged in the next generation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In The Chicago Tribune, Justice O'Connor said in a rare interview that the country can tackle many of these challenges. ''I hope it looks as though we don't need artificial help to fill our classrooms with highly qualified students at the graduate level,'' she said. ''And if we do our job on educating young people, we can reach that goal.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But closing the disparities in educational achievement and opportunities for college applicants across racial and ethnic lines will involve vociferous debate over the relative importance of school financing, social inequality and student study habits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Statistics tell the story. On every major indicator of academic success -- the SAT, the A.C.T. and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (given to elementary and secondary students) -- the gap between white and minority students has persisted for decades. Though it narrowed somewhat on the national assessment exams from the 1980's through the early 90's, the divide has only widened since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''There is some serious heavy lifting to do before we get to the dream scenario Justice O'Connor is envisioning,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and an assistant secretary of education in the Reagan administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some liberals say the gap can be closed only by equalizing the amount of money spent on educating whites and minorities. The school districts that many blacks and Hispanics attend spend $902 less per student on average than mostly white districts, according to a national study conducted last year by the Education Trust, a group focused on closing the achievement gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some degree, federal and state governments can, and do, try to fix this imbalance by sending more money to schools serving poor -- and, by extension, disproportionately minority -- students. Federal assistance for poor students is increasing, and state governments gave an average of $27 more per pupil to disproportionately minority schools in 2000 than to predominately white schools, though that hardly had a perceptible impact on the financing gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if federal and state lawmakers were bent on eliminating the financial discrepancies between white and minority districts, they couldn't have much affect. On average, states and the federal government have never accounted for more than 56 percent of schools' revenues over the last decade or so; the remainder has come from local sources, mostly property taxes. This financial structure makes parity unlikely at best.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And conservatives argue that the focus on financial parity misses the point, and point to some minority-dominated city school districts that have high spending per student but still lag well behind less flush districts, particularly in rural areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, educational parity may be linked to bigger, more complex economic factors. Most beneficiaries of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> are middle-income. According to a study by Anthony Carnevale, vice president of the Educational Testing Service, 74 percent of students at the 146 most prestigious colleges and universities -- where competition for admissions is most intense and where <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is practiced -- come from families in the top 25 percent of the nation's socioeconomic scale (as measured by income, educational attainment and occupations of the parents). Only 3 percent of the students at these highly selective schools come from the bottom 25 percent of the socioeconomic scale. As Lani Guinier, a law professor at Harvard University, puts it, ''<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is less an escalator up than it is a bridge across.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even middle-class black and Hispanic children who are burdened with issues of crime, troubled homes and poor schools have not been able to close the test-score gap with their white counterparts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The gap persists across all income levels,'' said Freeman Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, who has written extensively on improving the academic achievement of black students. ''We're talking about generations of habits in too many homes,'' said Mr. Hrabowski, who is black. ''Unfortunately, reading is not the No. 1 priority as a habit. There is much more emphasis on television watching.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both sides on the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> issue agree on the need to close the education gap, but not much else. Some supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hope that Justice O'Connor's 25-year time frame will protect <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> while the country makes headway in closing that rift.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the decision last week does not invalidate laws in California and Washington State that ban the use of race in public university admissions, hiring and government contracting. Ward Connerly, the black California businessman who was the force behind passing those laws, has already vowed to make Michigan his next target.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demographic pressures will also come into play. The Educational Testing Service estimates that from 1995 to 2015, the percentage of whites on college campuses will decline from 71 percent to 63 percent, while Hispanics will increase to 15 percent, from the current 11 percent, with blacks holding steady at 13 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with minorities making up a larger proportion of students going to college -- and with the children of young immigrants approaching college age toward the end of Justice O'Connor's 25-year target -- Hispanic and black parents may be clamoring even more forcefully that their children not be shut out of top schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the debate has not changed. Opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> will continue to say that such programs keep the country from focusing on what needs to be done -- namely, helping minority students meet higher standards. The supporters of race preferences counter that the country cannot end <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> without first fixing the education system. All agree that unless a commitment is made -- by society and minority families themselves -- the old arguments will still be around in 25 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lisa Navarette, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said, ''If all we do over the 25 years is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, then we will still need <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, 1964: The University of Michigan Law School yearbook reflects the times.

One whose ranks and command structure are dominated by non-Hispanic whites? Or one whose makeup roughly reflects that of the entire city?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Richard Daley's administration has announced a strategy to achieve something close to the latter. For this he should be applauded. Instead, he is being lambasted, seemingly from every quarter--though mainly by factions placing their own self-interest above the common good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley has said the next round of promotions to the rank of sergeant will not be based solely on the results of a written test. (The last time that was done, only five minorities placed among the 114 highest-scoring promotees.) Instead, 70 percent of next year's new sergeants will be chosen solely on test results, while another 30 percent will be selected on the basis of job performance. Presumably the latter will be chosen with an eye toward racial and ethnic balance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Police union bosses, apparently content to see a mostly white police force patrol a mostly black and Hispanic city, screamed immediately that Daley wants to bring back old-fashioned political cronyism to the promotion process. That's a cheap shot. It is also, however, fair warning to the mayor that the so-called \"merit\" promotees had better not be sponsored by his pals or by ward committeemen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaders of the African-American Police League, meanwhile, said they were \"insulted\" that the mayor thinks special measures are needed to qualify more black sergeants. They claim the written test--which deals mainly with laws and procedures a sergeant ought to know--is racially biased, even though expert after independent expert has said it is fair. (Perhaps the AAPL is unaware that there have been some problems here with the public schools.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, actual performance would be a welcome criterion even without the racial undertow. No written test can predict how effective an officer will be in defusing an ugly domestic dispute or differentiating at a glance between a drug lookout and somebody waiting for a bus. That requires common sense, compassion and knowledge of the community--none of which are ascertained best by multiple-choice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's uncertain whether Daley's plan will survive the inevitable judicial review. Appellate courts have been leaning against race-based admission and promotion systems, although a wise jurist ought to be able to differentiate between <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> quotas and a diverse city's need to develop an effective police force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Daley's solution isn't perfect. Job performance ought to figure into all promotions, not just 30 percent. And if this more subjective criterion is abused, as some predict, Chicagoans will know whom to blame. For now, the mayor's plan deserves support.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 20s "}}

Austin \u201cfills the rest of its classes with students who get in under a comprehensive, holistic review of their academic and personal records.\u201d When the case returns to the\u00a0Supreme Court, the justices should affirm that U.T.\u2019s \u201cconscientiously designed\u201d program, a cautious effort to complement the race-neutral top 10 percent program and seek diversity, is permissible.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Massachusetts State Legislature \u201ctook a big step toward addressing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s objections to the state\u2019s \u2018buffer-zone\u2019 law,\u201d\u00a0according to an editorial in The Boston Globe. The buffer-zone law prohibited protesting within 35 feet of the entrance to abortion clinics \u2014 it was \u201cdeemed by the court to be overly broad, restricting the free speech of the plaintiffs, who sought to dissuade women from having abortions by quietly handing them literature and urging them to consider alternatives.\u201d This new law would permit law-enforcement officers to order protesters to withdraw from an abbreviated buffer zone \u201cif they impede access to the clinic.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFor the past five months, the world\u2019s most important unelected official has been a 67-year-old former economics professor, who\u2019s apparently still pre-gentrified Brooklyn enough to pronounce guide \u2018goyd,\u2019\u201d\u00a0says an editorial in The Guardian. Since Janet Yellen\u2019s\u00a0appointment to chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, she has \u201cdisplayed the greatest acuity about what rate-setters must do: \u2018The low rate of wage growth is, to me, another sign that the Fed\u2019s job is not yet done.\u2019 Bingo!\u201d The difference between Ms. Yellen and her British counterpart, Mark J. Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is that \u201cwhile Mr. Carney has his sights set on unemployment, Ms. Yellen doesn\u2019t just want Americans off the dole \u2014 she wants to get them a pay rise too.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe massive, worldwide die-off of honeybees has been one of the biggest environmental scares of this new century,\u201d says an editorial in The Globe and Mail. \u201cThe possible extinction of the planet\u2019s most prolific pollinator is more than a bit terrifying.\u201d But \u201ccolony collapse disorder, while a real threat, is being remarkably well managed.\u201d Governments, scientists and beekeepers \u201chave been making steady progress against it\u201d \u2014 the European Union has imposed a two-year ban on three types of pesticide especially harmful to bees to measure whether their absence improves bee-colony health. Meanwhile, the Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists \u201chas done and excellent job of monitoring wintering losses since colony collapse disorder first came to light,\u201d and their annual reports since show a slowly declining average mortality rate during winter months. \u201cThere is more work and research to be done, but the outlook is hopeful.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cLast week, the U.N. Committee on Human Rights called on Japan to ensure that effective, independent and impartial investigations be launched into wartime sex slavery and to offer an apologia to \u2018comfort women,\u2019 who were forced to work in its military brothels,\u201d\u00a0according to an editorial in The Korea Herald. Tokyo rejected the committee\u2019s request. \u201cWhile expressing regrets about the recommendation, the Abe government denied again that Korean and other Asian women were coerced into military sex slavery.\u201d This historical revisionism is \u201cangering Korea and other victimized Asian countries,\u201d The Herald writes, and if Japan wishes to maintain \u201charmonious, friendly relations\u201d with Korea, Mr. Abe\u2019s government must come to terms with its colonial history.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 9s "}}
