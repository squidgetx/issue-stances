This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim,  county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held  by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason. The whole community has paid a terrible price.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies of the 1966-69 riots indicate that rioters are especially vulnerable  to feelings of ''relative deprivation'' -that is, they are most likely to resort to violence when they see the conditions of those around them (often other blacks) improving. While many blacks benefited from the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, the mass of blacks in the ghettos remains unaffected, and city after city erupted in racial violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1980, these conditions exist once again. Over the last 15 years, a class gap between the haves and have-nots has been slowly widening in most urban black communities. While the black middle class has doubled during that time (to between 35 percent and 45 percent of the American black population of 25.8 million), the size of the black lower class has barely diminished, and the proportion of workingclass blacks in menial service jobs may have actually increased. For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent. (The rest of the black work force is in higher-paying blue-collar jobs, and there is a minute percentage in farm work.)  Dillusionment among poor blacks in Miami is also heightened by the fact that bilingual and lighter-skinned Cubans have taken many of the jobs that traditionally have provided openings for blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dramatic growth of the American black middle class has resulted largely from a wholesale decline of racial discrimination in the labor market since the  1964 Civil Rights Act, but, unfortunately, this decline has not benefited disadvantaged blacks who lack the opportunity to attend college and compete for  corporate and government jobs. These blacks, in urban cores, must seek workingclass jobs that pay a living wage. Unfortunately, desirable bluecollar jobs in craft work and manufacturing are increasingly rare in central cities. Trends in the economy, such as automation and the suburbanization of industrial  production, mean that poor blacks, especially young, uneducated ones, spend most of their time competing for dead-end service jobs such as janitorial work.  These trends remain unaffected by strategies to fight discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our most conspicuous such strategy is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and, indeed, already we are hearing that the answer to the Miami riot is to invigorate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs. However well-intentioned such responses may be, undoubtedly they will have a perverse effect on race relations. By using race-conscious criteria, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> creates a divisive backlash among ethnic groups and workingclass whites. In addition, such programs also widen the class gap in the black community by helping a small portion of the community to  attend college, graduate school, and compete for desirable jobs, while the most  disadvantaged segments of the black community remain essentially untouched. What poor blacks need, at a minimum, is programs that are drected toward them: programs that will ensure full employment, increase teen-age employment opportunities, and meaningfully reform the welfare system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regrettably, these programs, or what is left of them, are being slashed from  the Federal budget. In the absence of these modest efforts, we cannot expect any significant improvement in the lot of poor blacks, regardless of strenuous efforts to combat discrimination.

Equipped by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, the HRA bombs Wall Street, causing billions of dollars in damage. In fact, the World Trade Center bombing of 1992 could easily be the work of these militants. They mortar-bomb the White House, and make unnervingly near-successful assassination attempts on both Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is the American public enraged? Quite the opposite: It's bored. Another bombing in El Paso? Big deal. Texas seems far away, and a thorn in the side. Maybe it would be a relief to shed the place, which doesn't even generate much oil revenue anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here the plot may take a turn toward the far-fetched: The sitting U.S. president -- let's call him Bartlet -- initiates a \"peace process.\" Laborious negotiations ensue involving the federal government, the Texas chapters of the Democratic and Republican parties, a political front for the HRA, and Mexico. (As to why the U.S. would negotiate with a foreign country over a state in the union, just suspend your disbelief.) Charitably, the HRA offers to refrains from blowing up bars or assassinating presidents. At last they hammer out a deal, to international celebration. No more carnage!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not the end of the story, because \"peace\" doesn't come cheap. Texas is still a star in Old Glory, but the American flag is put out of view in public places lest it alienate Hispanics. A complex bureaucratic apparatus now links Austin and Mexico City to coordinate social policy. President Bartlet doesn't dare sneeze in Texas without asking the Mexican president's permission, and all statements in relation to the Lone Star state are issued jointly with the Mexican government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It gets weirder: Every HRA sniper and bomber that the FBI apprehended gets to go home, though many have just started life sentences.

The Texas state police force, which did so much to keep the HRA from killing even more people than it did, is drastically downsized and renamed.

No, the president of the U.S. grovels. With no promises from the HRA on disarmament (its representatives have proposed how they might theoretically disarm, but not when), he promises to withdraw the National Guard from Texas and to dismantle its outposts. He announces an amnesty for HRA men on the lam, giving about 60 desperadoes a clean record. He promises the secessionist leadership that convicted felons can infiltrate the Texas police force, and serve on its supervisory board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this happens even though a new dissident group is bombing D.C. again. (The \"Real\" HRA comprises disaffected HRA members who still think -- and you can see why, with such an accommodating federal government -- that they can win Texas by force.) Mr. Bartlet dangles the possibility of disbanding the FBI's Domestic Counter-Terrorism Program, which HRA people despise because it's been so effective at catching them red-handed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You seem skeptical. Let killers out of jail, having served only one or two years? Not in the U.S. of A! Convicted murderers in the police, supervising police operations? As if! Decisions on the National Guard and FBI made solely on the basis of demands by a bunch of unelected terrorists? A ridiculous book! It'll never sell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Your mistake. It has sold -- foreign rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>British Prime Minister Tony Blair uses the fact that mainland Britons (and Americans) are bored and confused by Northern Ireland. Awkward formulations like \"putting arms beyond use\" -- in deference to terrorists' delicate sensibilities -- and lofty calls for peace disguise the fact that he is selling out his law-abiding countrymen for the sake of short-term expedience. The details of the latest shenanigans -- London's suspension of Belfast's assembly and its resumption 24 hours later, the equally theatrical submission and retraction of a vague IRA \"offer\" to disarm -- are unimportant, though their bureaucratic and rhetorical complexity, for both parties, is usefully obfuscating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I cling to the conviction that no U.S. president would make major decisions about American security in accordance with the wishes of people like McVeigh. It's unimaginable that Americans would tolerate a commander-in-chief who installed unrepentant terrorists in executive positions of a state government, invited convicted murderers to join and oversee a virtually dismantled state police force, and released wholesale into the community felons after risibly short sentences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oklahoma City aside, Americans have been lucky with respect to domestic terrorism. As it becomes easier technologically for small groups to cause mass casualties, that luck may not hold. If we ever are subjected to such a movement within our borders, we are likely to look to places like Northern Ireland for solutions, only to discover that the British government has prostrated itself before killers, lavishing a terrorist movement with every political gratuity it can think of -- throwing pearls before swine. Ulster sets a disturbing precedent. To avoid abridging the most fundamental democratic principles, we may be forced to turn elsewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Shriver is a London-based American novelist and journalist who lived for 12 years in Belfast.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: Letters to the Editor: The `Void' in the British System\" -- WSJ Sept. 5, 2001)</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Stranger Than Fiction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LONDON -- New York literary agents, take note of this plot for a thriller:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A heavily armed band of Latinos -- call them the Hispanic Republican Army -- is determined to return the oppressed American \"colony\" of Texas to Mexico.

With no promises from the HRA on disarmament (its representatives have proposed how they might theoretically disarm, but not when), he promises to withdraw the National Guard from Texas and to dismantle its outposts. He announces an amnesty for HRA men on the lam, giving about 60 desperadoes a clean record. He promises the secessionist leadership that convicted felons can infiltrate the Texas police force, and serve on its supervisory board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this happens even though a new dissident group is bombing D.C. again. (The \"Real\" HRA comprises disaffected HRA members who still think -- and you can see why, with such an accommodating federal government -- that they can win Texas by force.) Mr. Bartlet dangles the possibility of disbanding the FBI's Domestic Counter-Terrorism Program, which HRA people despise because it's been so effective at catching them red-handed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You seem skeptical. Let killers out of jail, having served only one or two years? Not in the U.S. of A! Convicted murderers in the police, supervising police operations? As if! Decisions on the National Guard and FBI made solely on the basis of demands by a bunch of unelected terrorists? A ridiculous book! It'll never sell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Your mistake. It has sold -- foreign rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>British Prime Minister Tony Blair uses the fact that mainland Britons (and Americans) are bored and confused by Northern Ireland. Awkward formulations like \"putting arms beyond use\" -- in deference to terrorists' delicate sensibilities -- and lofty calls for peace disguise the fact that he is selling out his law-abiding countrymen for the sake of short-term expedience. The details of the latest shenanigans -- London's suspension of Belfast's assembly and its resumption 24 hours later, the equally theatrical submission and retraction of a vague IRA \"offer\" to disarm -- are unimportant, though their bureaucratic and rhetorical complexity, for both parties, is usefully obfuscating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I cling to the conviction that no U.S. president would make major decisions about American security in accordance with the wishes of people like McVeigh. It's unimaginable that Americans would tolerate a commander-in-chief who installed unrepentant terrorists in executive positions of a state government, invited convicted murderers to join and oversee a virtually dismantled state police force, and released wholesale into the community felons after risibly short sentences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oklahoma City aside, Americans have been lucky with respect to domestic terrorism. As it becomes easier technologically for small groups to cause mass casualties, that luck may not hold. If we ever are subjected to such a movement within our borders, we are likely to look to places like Northern Ireland for solutions, only to discover that the British government has prostrated itself before killers, lavishing a terrorist movement with every political gratuity it can think of -- throwing pearls before swine. Ulster sets a disturbing precedent. To avoid abridging the most fundamental democratic principles, we may be forced to turn elsewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Shriver is a London-based American novelist and journalist who lived for 12 years in Belfast.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: Letters to the Editor: The `Void' in the British System\" -- WSJ Sept. 5, 2001)</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/421552708.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/421552708.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>A Father-Son Discussion on Affirmative Action</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My son's high school essay made me steam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the title smacked of mockery: \"Affirmative Action: What Is It Good For?\" It seemed to echo the 1960s song that asked the same question about war.
