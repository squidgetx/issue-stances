Knots of journalists could be seen in animated conversation in the newsroom. \"What do you think?\" one would ask, and then a heated discussion would follow. Were they talking about the Unabomber and the decision of The Post to publish his modest tome? No. The hot subject was a published criticism of The Post's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The venue was the New Republic, and the author was Ruth Shalit. Not only did she find \"racial strife\" at The Post but she accused the paper of so slavishly adhering to its <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> goals that it had lowered its standards in both hiring and news coverage. At The Post, she alleged, the best man does not always win -- an assertion that does not conform with what I know. Shalit has that part wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The editor of The Post, Leonard Downie Jr., vividly said as much. \"False,\" \"amateurish,\" \"shameful,\" \"racial McCarthyism\" and \"big-lie propaganda\" are some of the words he used. The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham, was equally exercised, and noted that the New Republic \"has never had a full-time black staffer.\" He suggested a motto for the magazine: \"Looking for a qualified black since 1914.\" In the areas of hiring standards and news coverage, The Post's response was so detailed as to be convincing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, it was deviously clever of Shalit to choose The Washington Post to write about what, in effect, was <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. After all, The Post is a liberal institution -- and I am not talking about its editorial positions (not all that liberal) or its supposed political line (nonexistent).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I am talking, instead, of its benevolent corporate culture. Firings are rare, layoffs nonexistent. Its journalists are relatively well paid, and they work for an organization about which they feel immense pride. I mean, the Unabomber didn't pick any ol' rag to blackmail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even here <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has produced \"racial strife.\" The Post's announced goal is to have minorities make up 25 percent of its new hires and women 50 percent. To that end, it has established an operation within the newsroom that, among other things, is responsible for recruiting minorities and women. The Post is adamant that its goals not be perceived as quotas, and, as with Ford, quality remains job one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, to a white male a message has been sent. He feels himself operating under a quota system, and no amount of assurance that goals are not quotas is going to ameliorate the emotional impact. Somehow, a goal feels like a quota, and a quota feels unfair. The Post insists its standards have not been lowered. Okay.

Knots of journalists could be seen in animated conversation in the newsroom. \"What do you think?\" one would ask, and then a heated discussion would follow. Were they talking about the Unabomber and the decision of The Post to publish his modest tome? No. The hot subject was a published criticism of The Post's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The venue was the New Republic, and the author was Ruth Shalit. Not only did she find \"racial strife\" at The Post but she accused the paper of so slavishly adhering to its <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> goals that it had lowered its standards in both hiring and news coverage. At The Post, she alleged, the best man does not always win -- an assertion that does not conform with what I know. Shalit has that part wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The editor of The Post, Leonard Downie Jr., vividly said as much. \"False,\" \"amateurish,\" \"shameful,\" \"racial McCarthyism\" and \"big-lie propaganda\" are some of the words he used. The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham, was equally exercised, and noted that the New Republic \"has never had a full-time black staffer.\" He suggested a motto for the magazine: \"Looking for a qualified black since 1914.\" In the areas of hiring standards and news coverage, The Post's response was so detailed as to be convincing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, it was deviously clever of Shalit to choose The Washington Post to write about what, in effect, was <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. After all, The Post is a liberal institution -- and I am not talking about its editorial positions (not all that liberal) or its supposed political line (nonexistent).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I am talking, instead, of its benevolent corporate culture. Firings are rare, layoffs nonexistent. Its journalists are relatively well paid, and they work for an organization about which they feel immense pride. I mean, the Unabomber didn't pick any ol' rag to blackmail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even here <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has produced \"racial strife.\" The Post's announced goal is to have minorities make up 25 percent of its new hires and women 50 percent. To that end, it has established an operation within the newsroom that, among other things, is responsible for recruiting minorities and women. The Post is adamant that its goals not be perceived as quotas, and, as with Ford, quality remains job one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, to a white male a message has been sent. He feels himself operating under a quota system, and no amount of assurance that goals are not quotas is going to ameliorate the emotional impact. Somehow, a goal feels like a quota, and a quota feels unfair. The Post insists its standards have not been lowered. Okay. But for white males, a barrier appears to have been raised.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Washington Post-New Republic dustup may seem a parody of inside-the-Beltway nonsense, but the issues raised are hardly parochial. The newspaper business is similar to many others -- it's contracting. Newspapers are folding or merging.

It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department.

Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants.

When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?

The muckraking publication Sales & Marketing Management recently pointed out to its readers that \"African-Americans confront stereotypes that make it difficult for them to sell to [white] customers.\" Who could doubt it? And yet the same presumably liberal California voters who plumped heavily for Bill Clinton last week also decided that racial preferences are the wrong solution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the honest uncertainty, perhaps we should accept that there is more to human dignity than twisting ourselves into pretzels of \"sensitivity.\" And keeping a few old goats around at Texaco who remember when the business of an oil company was finding oil, not color-coding jelly beans, may not be such a bad thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: On the Basis of Merit Only\" -- WSJ Nov. 19, 1996)</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Business world: If you hear the forbidden word, everybody get real stupid</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wasted a weekend listening to the Texaco tapes, figuring it was the least I could do before casting the company and its former treasurer, Robert Ulrich, into the outer darkness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it would have been a great column: The tapes were impossibly muddy; there was no way to tell if Mr. Ulrich had used the dreaded \"n\" word; the purblind media, from the New York Times and Ted Koppel on down, was nuts for insisting that \"black jelly bean\" was a racist term; etc.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alas for journalism if not for justice, Texaco spent the week working electronic magic on the tape, and lo, the mystery word turns out to be \"Nicholas,\" and \"jelly bean\" is an approved Texaco metaphor for multicultural togetherness.

But the tone is jocular rather than angry. Elsewhere, Mr. Ulrich can be heard reviewing employment records and remarking with satisfaction on the advancement of women and minorities. And in a discussion of how to talk prospective downsizees out the door, Mr. Ulrich comes across rather well -- sensitive yet realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The press might have thrown this evidence onto the scale when weighing whether \"nunjunah\" was really \"nigger.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Calls around Texaco last week didn't find anybody willing to say, on the record or off, what sort of guy Mr. Ulrich was, even though Mr. Bijur and the rest worked side by side with him for years. Their desire to duck this question was not hard to fathom: If Mr. Ulrich were a hardened racist, they should have booted him out long ago. If he were a decent guy, defending him now would violate the first rule of post-Tylenol crisis management, which is never defend yourself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, having scored this slamdunk over various Interfaith Councils for Decrying Big Business, the company blithers that the tapes are still \"troubling.\" But Texaco must live in the world, and will certainly cough up generously to settle the lawsuit and become exemplary for its \"diversity\" programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the rest of us, we might conclude that senior executives of Big Oil are honestly at sea over \"diversity\" -- as these tapes clearly reveal -- no less than anyone else is. The muckraking publication Sales & Marketing Management recently pointed out to its readers that \"African-Americans confront stereotypes that make it difficult for them to sell to [white] customers.\" Who could doubt it? And yet the same presumably liberal California voters who plumped heavily for Bill Clinton last week also decided that racial preferences are the wrong solution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the honest uncertainty, perhaps we should accept that there is more to human dignity than twisting ourselves into pretzels of \"sensitivity.\" And keeping a few old goats around at Texaco who remember when the business of an oil company was finding oil, not color-coding jelly beans, may not be such a bad thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: On the Basis of Merit Only\" -- WSJ Nov. 19, 1996)</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1023015447.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1023015447.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>Main Street: Chief Justice Roberts Taxes Credibility</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not once in the 59 pages that constitute Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts's lead opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v.

In an unprecedented move on the first day, Democrats tried to shut down the hearing by complaining that Republicans were withholding documents about Kavanaugh's record. Republicans accused Democrats of political grandstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it was all over, the highly qualified and reliably conservative judge was headed for approval in the Senate Judiciary Committee, albeit with Republican votes only.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This surely has been the most contentious hearing since [Clarence] Thomas\" in 1991, said University of Georgia law professor Lori Ringhand, who has written a history of court confirmation hearings. \"Cooperation among the committee members seems to have completely broken down.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She said the hearing continued the trend of revealing less and less about a nominee's views. \"Kavanaugh seemed to provide firm answers to even fewer substantive questions than [Justice Neil M.] Gorsuch, who provided fewer firm answers than any nominee for decades. In my opinion, this strips the process of much of its value.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Thomas confirmation in 1991 had stood alone as unusually contentious for two reasons. Thomas was a 43-year-old black conservative with a thin record when he was tapped to succeed Justice Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights legend. And after a week of hearings, the public learned that Anita Hill, a former aide, had accused him of sexual harassment. Nonetheless, Thomas won confirmation on a 52-48 vote in a Senate controlled by Democrats. He then joined a court where most of the justices had won unanimous Senate confirmation, including Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, there has been a steady decline in the number of senators who will cross party lines to confirm a high court nominee. In 1993, President Clinton's first nominee, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, won with a 96-3 vote. In 2005, President George W. Bush's first nominee, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., won on a 78-22 vote. In 2009, President Obama's first nominee, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, won on a 68-31 vote. And last year, Gorsuch, President Trump's first nominee, won by a 54-45 vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was the lone Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee to support Obama's nominees. On Thursday, he bemoaned the raucous partisanship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People wonder,\" he said, \"are these hearings turning into a circus?\" But Graham said this was not fair nor accurate. \"Circuses are entertaining, and you can take your children to them. This hearing is neither entertaining nor appropriate for young people.\" He referred to the regular shout-outs from protesters who were dragged from the hearing room.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators from both major parties often speak of their desire for a \"neutral\" judge who will simply follow the law and rule fairly without bias. But their actions tell a different story.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the Republicans joined together in 2016 to block even a hearing for a highly qualified Obama nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now all the Democrats, at least on the committee, are united in their opposition to Kavanaugh to fill the seat of the recently retired Kennedy, the high court's swing justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservative scholars credited Kavanaugh with a strong, steady performance amid the partisan squabbling. \"He is an experienced, thoughtful and intelligent mainstream judicial conservative. I do not believe we learned anything new about him, but we have learned a bit about the new normal in terms of collegiality in the Senate and the depth of activists' frustration with the administration,\" said Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Women's rights advocates and liberal scholars were not reassured by his testimony. \"Our fears about the future of this country deepened this week when Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly refused to answer questions about his views on abortion, employment discrimination, immigration and healthcare. Our civil rights, dignity and autonomy will be in grave danger if he is confirmed,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, pointed to the jarring contrast between Kavanaugh's public praise for the Brown vs. Board of Education school desegregation ruling and his private White House memos deriding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies. \"Seeing him use words like 'naked racial set-aside' and 'racial spoils system' to refer to race-conscious measures intended to redress entrenched systemic racism is upsetting,\" Wydra said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump promised to appoint justices who would vote to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that established a woman's right to choose abortion, and Democrats pressed Kavanaugh to explain his views. He repeatedly said Roe was a \"precedent,\" but would not say it was correctly decided.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he described the 1974 ruling in United States vs. Nixon, which required the president to turn over the Watergate tapes, as correct and one of the great moments in the court's history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cornell law professor Michael Dorf was a clerk for Kennedy in 1992, when the court reaffirmed the right to abortion in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, and said Kavanaugh's comments did not signal he would uphold abortion rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Understood in context, he said very little,\" Dorf said, except that Roe and Casey are precedents. \"There is good reason to think that in addition to Justice Thomas, Chief Justice Roberts and Justices [Samuel A.] Alito and Gorsuch would overrule Roe if presented with the opportunity,\" he said. If so, he said, Kavanaugh could supply the fifth vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When asked about same-sex marriage, Kavanaugh took a different approach that may be significant. He spoke of a passage from Kennedy's opinion in June in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case that endorsed equal rights for gays and lesbians. Kavanaugh noted correctly that nearly all the justices, including the leading conservatives, signed the opinion, which -- as he paraphrased it -- said that \"the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans, or gay and lesbian couples, as second-class citizens or inferior in dignity or worth are over in the Supreme Court. That's a very important statement.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) had asked him to say whether the 2015 ruling in Obergefell vs. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage was correctly decided. It is a \"yes or no\" question, she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kavanaugh refused to answer, repeating his statement that a nominee should not give a \"thumbs-up or thumbs-down\" response to recent rulings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leading gay rights advocates said they were not reassured. They noted the court in the Masterpiece case ruled that the Colorado cake maker was treated unfairly based on his Christian beliefs. Sharon McGowan, a lawyer for the gay rights advocacy group Lambda Legal, said Kavanaugh's \"bobbing and weaving to avoid endorsing Obergefell speaks volumes. It signals not only to us, but also to his most fervent supporters, that he is prepared to grant religious opt-outs from nondiscrimination laws that are designed to protect LGBT people and their families.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the next year, the court is likely to take up another religious rights case, possibly from a florist in western Washington state who refused to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. The court's conservatives are likely to look favorably on her claim for a religious exemption from the state's civil rights law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is no sign the court's conservatives are interested in revisiting the issue of same-sex marriage. Abortion remains highly disputed, and several Republican-led states are likely to enact bans on abortion that will send the issue back before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, conservative lawmakers are not pressing to enact new bans on same-sex marriage, and as Kavanaugh's comment suggested, there is no reason to believe such a challenge would be welcome at the high court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>david.savage@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: BRETT KAVANAUGH takes a break Thursday from his confirmation hearing with former players of a youth basketball team he coached.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Drew Angerer Getty Images</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>ANALYSIS; Senate testimony insights; Kavanaugh's Supreme Court hearing shows growing partisanship, but reveals little about his views on the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week's Senate hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh lived up to -- or perhaps down to -- expectations for how modern-day justices are confirmed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A sharp partisan divide was on display from the first minute and lasted until the bitter end. In an unprecedented move on the first day, Democrats tried to shut down the hearing by complaining that Republicans were withholding documents about Kavanaugh's record. Republicans accused Democrats of political grandstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it was all over, the highly qualified and reliably conservative judge was headed for approval in the Senate Judiciary Committee, albeit with Republican votes only.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This surely has been the most contentious hearing since [Clarence] Thomas\" in 1991, said University of Georgia law professor Lori Ringhand, who has written a history of court confirmation hearings. \"Cooperation among the committee members seems to have completely broken down.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She said the hearing continued the trend of revealing less and less about a nominee's views. \"Kavanaugh seemed to provide firm answers to even fewer substantive questions than [Justice Neil M.] Gorsuch, who provided fewer firm answers than any nominee for decades. In my opinion, this strips the process of much of its value.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Thomas confirmation in 1991 had stood alone as unusually contentious for two reasons. Thomas was a 43-year-old black conservative with a thin record when he was tapped to succeed Justice Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights legend. And after a week of hearings, the public learned that Anita Hill, a former aide, had accused him of sexual harassment. Nonetheless, Thomas won confirmation on a 52-48 vote in a Senate controlled by Democrats. He then joined a court where most of the justices had won unanimous Senate confirmation, including Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, there has been a steady decline in the number of senators who will cross party lines to confirm a high court nominee. In 1993, President Clinton's first nominee, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, won with a 96-3 vote. In 2005, President George W. Bush's first nominee, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., won on a 78-22 vote. In 2009, President Obama's first nominee, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, won on a 68-31 vote. And last year, Gorsuch, President Trump's first nominee, won by a 54-45 vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was the lone Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee to support Obama's nominees. On Thursday, he bemoaned the raucous partisanship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People wonder,\" he said, \"are these hearings turning into a circus?\" But Graham said this was not fair nor accurate. \"Circuses are entertaining, and you can take your children to them. This hearing is neither entertaining nor appropriate for young people.\" He referred to the regular shout-outs from protesters who were dragged from the hearing room.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators from both major parties often speak of their desire for a \"neutral\" judge who will simply follow the law and rule fairly without bias. But their actions tell a different story.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the Republicans joined together in 2016 to block even a hearing for a highly qualified Obama nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now all the Democrats, at least on the committee, are united in their opposition to Kavanaugh to fill the seat of the recently retired Kennedy, the high court's swing justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservative scholars credited Kavanaugh with a strong, steady performance amid the partisan squabbling. \"He is an experienced, thoughtful and intelligent mainstream judicial conservative. I do not believe we learned anything new about him, but we have learned a bit about the new normal in terms of collegiality in the Senate and the depth of activists' frustration with the administration,\" said Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Women's rights advocates and liberal scholars were not reassured by his testimony. \"Our fears about the future of this country deepened this week when Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly refused to answer questions about his views on abortion, employment discrimination, immigration and healthcare.

This has had the effect of drawing some students from areas of the state where minorities make up the majority without distinguishing among students based on race. The case is about what the university can do from there. UT fills the rest of its classes with students who get in under a comprehensive, holistic review of their academic and personal records. In that analysis, race can be used as \"a factor of a factor of a factor of a factor,\" as advocates put it, as admissions officers assemble a complete picture of an applicant's profile. The 5th Circuit points out that this resembles the sort of individualized review of applicants that the Supreme Court has insisted must occur if race is to be explicitly considered in public university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university's opponents charge that the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> policy is unnecessary.

Fewer and fewer of today's undergraduates are pursuing the liberal arts, with most of them studying practical subjects like finance, marketing, real estate and pharmacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But James O. Freedman, 67, the retired president of Dartmouth, remains more committed than ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Liberal education opens our eyes to what life is principally about,'' he said. ''It's about understanding yourself and having some resources to deal with everything life throws at you. It's about developing a moral compass and some understanding of how society works, how democracies work.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At home in Cambridge, with his new book, ''Liberal Education and the Public Interest'' (University of Iowa Press, 2003), an ode to the value of liberal education, on the coffee table in front of him, Mr. Freedman makes his case with passion. Contrary to what critics might say, when it comes to getting a job in today's economy, Mr. Freedman says a liberal education is an important advantage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''A liberal education is what teaches people how to write and how to think and makes them much more valuable in the job market over a 40-year career than graduates of a preprofessional program,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''All the employers will tell you that they're seeking the flexibility of mind that a liberal education imbues.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His book came out in January, as he was battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system. The chemotherapy he has been undergoing since September is working.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the fall, with a tumor pressing against the nerves of his lower back, he was using a wheelchair. Now, he needs only a cane to navigate the stairs of the Victorian home he shares with his wife, Sheba.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is Mr. Freedman's fourth bout with cancer since 1994, and just as he writes in his book that a liberal education enables us to see life more clearly, so has he looked clearly at his illness. The odds are that it will return again in a year, he says, and while he hopes to watch his three small grandchildren grow up, he says, there is no way of knowing just how many years he has.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is focusing, as ever, on writing, and speaking out for the liberal values that he has spent his lifetime working for and that he now sees eroding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Life is what we are doing now,'' he writes in his book, reflecting upon the importance of an early commitment to the values of liberal arts, equal education, idealism and public service.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his desk upstairs are a thousand pages of his fourth book: a memoir that moves from his growing up as the son of a high school English teacher in Manchester, N.H., to his undergraduate days at Harvard, where, he says, he was too timid and conventional to be a brilliant student, and on to Yale Law School, where he blossomed intellectually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The book ends at age 27, when he was a law clerk for Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, one of his heroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman put his knowledge of the law to use recently, when, as a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, he helped prepare a brief for the United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The future of America depends on educating minority men and women,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his 11 years as president of Dartmouth, Mr. Freedman devoted himself to making the college welcoming to what he called the creative loners, cellists, poets and mathematicians, as well as athletes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also carved out a role as a public intellectual, standing up to a group of right-wing students -- and their prominent, adult benefactors -- who were ridiculing blacks, homosexuals, women and Jews on campus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making their views known through the neoconservative, off-campus Dartmouth Review, the students ran a front page cartoon that showed Mr. Freedman, who is Jewish, dressed like Adolf Hitler. Eventually, tolerance and civility were restored.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last September, concerned by news reports that Jewish students were being intimidated on campuses amid protests over the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Freedman helped collect signatures from 310 college presidents for a statement calling for ''intimidation-free'' campuses. Some presidents criticized the statement for focusing only on Jewish students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With heavy snow falling on the streets of Cambridge, Mr. Freedman was relaxing in his living room, with Sheba, his wife of nearly 40 years, across from him. They were surrounded by some of Mr. Freedman's 2,000 favorite books, by T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, Saul Bellow, Faulkner, Joyce.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lifelong book collector, Mr. Freedman reluctantly parted with 4,000 other favorites when he left Dartmouth -- and the library at the president's house -- for Cambridge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward evening, the doorbell rang. Howard Gardner, the Harvard educational psychologist who is one of Mr. Freedman's closest friends, came in from the snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In retirement, as an elder statesman of academia, Mr. Freedman's advice is sought frequently. Professor Gardner wanted to consult with him about three academics who needed jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman is ''the ultimate search engine,'' Professor Gardner said, ''because he knows so many people, in so many ways, heart, mind, spirit.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Life is unpredictable and full of disappointment, Mr. Freedman writes in his book, the breakup of marriages, death of loved ones, enduring illness. In such a world, he writes, ''how ought one to lead a life?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''That is one of the questions that a liberal education addresses,'' he writes. ''The most effective protection against the contingencies of experience are values that appeal to our very best natures and anchor us most securely in the ocean of fate.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are the kinds of subjects Dr. Donald Kaufman, one of Mr. Freedman's oncologists, says he enjoys discussing with the former college president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''I always reserve 30 minutes for his visits,'' Dr. Kaufman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''They go on for 90. This is for my benefit, not his. He's teaching me what it means to be a patient. He's teaching people how to live.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James O. Freedman, right, the retired president of Dartmouth, with his friend Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist.

Freedman, 67, the retired president of Dartmouth, remains more committed than ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Liberal education opens our eyes to what life is principally about,'' he said. ''It's about understanding yourself and having some resources to deal with everything life throws at you. It's about developing a moral compass and some understanding of how society works, how democracies work.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At home in Cambridge, with his new book, ''Liberal Education and the Public Interest'' (University of Iowa Press, 2003), an ode to the value of liberal education, on the coffee table in front of him, Mr. Freedman makes his case with passion. Contrary to what critics might say, when it comes to getting a job in today's economy, Mr. Freedman says a liberal education is an important advantage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''A liberal education is what teaches people how to write and how to think and makes them much more valuable in the job market over a 40-year career than graduates of a preprofessional program,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''All the employers will tell you that they're seeking the flexibility of mind that a liberal education imbues.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His book came out in January, as he was battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system. The chemotherapy he has been undergoing since September is working.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the fall, with a tumor pressing against the nerves of his lower back, he was using a wheelchair. Now, he needs only a cane to navigate the stairs of the Victorian home he shares with his wife, Sheba.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is Mr. Freedman's fourth bout with cancer since 1994, and just as he writes in his book that a liberal education enables us to see life more clearly, so has he looked clearly at his illness. The odds are that it will return again in a year, he says, and while he hopes to watch his three small grandchildren grow up, he says, there is no way of knowing just how many years he has.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is focusing, as ever, on writing, and speaking out for the liberal values that he has spent his lifetime working for and that he now sees eroding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Life is what we are doing now,'' he writes in his book, reflecting upon the importance of an early commitment to the values of liberal arts, equal education, idealism and public service.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his desk upstairs are a thousand pages of his fourth book: a memoir that moves from his growing up as the son of a high school English teacher in Manchester, N.H., to his undergraduate days at Harvard, where, he says, he was too timid and conventional to be a brilliant student, and on to Yale Law School, where he blossomed intellectually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The book ends at age 27, when he was a law clerk for Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, one of his heroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman put his knowledge of the law to use recently, when, as a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, he helped prepare a brief for the United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The future of America depends on educating minority men and women,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his 11 years as president of Dartmouth, Mr. Freedman devoted himself to making the college welcoming to what he called the creative loners, cellists, poets and mathematicians, as well as athletes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also carved out a role as a public intellectual, standing up to a group of right-wing students -- and their prominent, adult benefactors -- who were ridiculing blacks, homosexuals, women and Jews on campus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making their views known through the neoconservative, off-campus Dartmouth Review, the students ran a front page cartoon that showed Mr. Freedman, who is Jewish, dressed like Adolf Hitler. Eventually, tolerance and civility were restored.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last September, concerned by news reports that Jewish students were being intimidated on campuses amid protests over the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Freedman helped collect signatures from 310 college presidents for a statement calling for ''intimidation-free'' campuses. Some presidents criticized the statement for focusing only on Jewish students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With heavy snow falling on the streets of Cambridge, Mr. Freedman was relaxing in his living room, with Sheba, his wife of nearly 40 years, across from him. They were surrounded by some of Mr. Freedman's 2,000 favorite books, by T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, Saul Bellow, Faulkner, Joyce.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lifelong book collector, Mr. Freedman reluctantly parted with 4,000 other favorites when he left Dartmouth -- and the library at the president's house -- for Cambridge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward evening, the doorbell rang. Howard Gardner, the Harvard educational psychologist who is one of Mr. Freedman's closest friends, came in from the snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In retirement, as an elder statesman of academia, Mr. Freedman's advice is sought frequently. Professor Gardner wanted to consult with him about three academics who needed jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman is ''the ultimate search engine,'' Professor Gardner said, ''because he knows so many people, in so many ways, heart, mind, spirit.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Life is unpredictable and full of disappointment, Mr. Freedman writes in his book, the breakup of marriages, death of loved ones, enduring illness. In such a world, he writes, ''how ought one to lead a life?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''That is one of the questions that a liberal education addresses,'' he writes. ''The most effective protection against the contingencies of experience are values that appeal to our very best natures and anchor us most securely in the ocean of fate.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are the kinds of subjects Dr. Donald Kaufman, one of Mr. Freedman's oncologists, says he enjoys discussing with the former college president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''I always reserve 30 minutes for his visits,'' Dr. Kaufman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''They go on for 90. This is for my benefit, not his. He's teaching me what it means to be a patient. He's teaching people how to live.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James O. Freedman, right, the retired president of Dartmouth, with his friend Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist. Mr. Freedman's new book contends that when it comes to getting a job, a well-rounded education is a major advantage. (C. J.
