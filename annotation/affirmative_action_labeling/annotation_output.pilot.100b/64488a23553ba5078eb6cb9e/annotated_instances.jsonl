A coalition of civil rights groups made the settlement possible by agreeing to pay 70 percent of the $433,500 judgment that Sharon Taxman won in a lower court for back pay and lawyers' fees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> thought that the Supreme Court, which was scheduled to hear the case in January, was likely to find the race-based layoff decision improper. They also feared the Court would have gone further and prohibited consideration of racial criteria in employment in general, thus jeopardizing voluntary <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> plans in all workplaces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Avoiding a Supreme Court ruling, in this situation, was a smart move. The Piscataway case was a difficult one with unusual facts. The teachers, hired the same day, had equal seniority and comparable qualifications. The school district, forced to trim staff for budget reasons, chose to keep the black teacher because she was the only black teacher in her department. The district's goal of maintaining racial diversity was honorable, but its approach was clumsy. The Clinton Administration, which first supported the action, reversed itself this summer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At some point, the Supreme Court will address whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits considering race in any employment decision, except as a remedy for actual discrimination. The Piscataway case, however, was a poor vehicle for that legal debate.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 57s "}}

But this gives them too much credit. It implies they have a starting team. Not these days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bench is where players are stashed who can step in for the first team--for a governor, a U.S. senator, a state attorney general. . . . The GOP currently has none of these top positions. Democrats occupy the governor's office, both U.S. Senate seats and five of seven statewide partisan offices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of two statewide elected Republicans--Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush--has suffered a potential career-ending scandal. Scratch him as a future governor. The other--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Secretary of State Bill Jones--angered major GOP campaign contributors by defecting to Sen. John McCain after having committed to Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Jones is now on the political disabled list.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is one healthy player, and he's not exactly a bench warmer. He's the new state Senate minority leader, Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte, 44, is the most politically savvy, articulate Republican in the Legislature. Indeed, it's tough to think of a Republican throughout California who commands more respect among politicians of either party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He makes things happen in the Capitol,\" notes GOP consultant Ray McNally. \"And he does it without surrendering his conservative principles. Without selling out.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte's first political job was slapping on bumper strips for gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan as a 10-year-old. Eventually, he became an advance man for Vice President George Bush, worked for several politicians and was elected to the Assembly in 1990.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Quickly rising to Republican leader, Brulte orchestrated the GOP's \"takeover\" of the Assembly in 1994. But three Republicans sold out to Democrat Willie Brown and Brulte was denied the speakership. In 1996, he moved to the Senate, became GOP caucus chairman and, when Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine stepped down as minority leader for family health reasons last week, Brulte succeeded him without a fight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's now his responsibility to improve the GOP's 25-15 disadvantage in the Senate--or at least keep the scarce seats the party holds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What drives Brulte is political conquest and legislative compromise, not any ideological cause. He brings to the arena congeniality. \"I don't provoke people,\" notes the 6-foot, 4-inch, 260- pound GOP leader.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That means less legislative gridlock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's not one to hang up a budget over, say, abortion funding. In truth, no recent GOP leader has, partly due to Brulte's coaxing. He's basically antiabortion but tries to avoid the divisive issue. Same with gun control; he mostly votes against it, but cautions Republicans that they are on the wrong side of history on firearms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked how his party got to this low point, Brulte replies: \"It allowed itself to be painted as intolerant. It picked issues that tended to divide rather than to unite. And we're now [in the Senate] trying to focus on issues that unite.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Issues like school accountability, lower college fees, transportation planning. He won't get into the errant, divisive issues--abortion, illegal immigration, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte has his own <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program: He pumped $400,000 from his political kitty into the winning primary campaigns of Republican women and minorities. \"I wanted to send a signal that at the highest level of the party, we're prepared to put our money where our mouth is,\" he says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An optimist, Brulte professes not to worry about the GOP's future in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Conventional wisdom is historically wrong,\" he says. \"Three years ago, Gray Davis was pretty much derided. Today he's governor. . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Perception always trails reality. And the Republican Party was in trouble long before people recognized it. We're still in trouble, but we're better off than people think.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The party is financially better off since Brulte became its finance chairman last fall. It was $300,000 in debt; now it has more than $1 million in the bank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Considered Bush's point man in California, Brulte recruited the candidate for a $2-million-plus party fund-raising dinner. This week, Bush is in California again raising another $2 million for the state and national parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Says Gov. Davis' chief strategist, Garry South: \"I think the world of Brulte. We're honest with each other. He's never sleazed me. I pick his brain. He picks mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"My only concern about Brulte is he's had such a meteoric rise, he's going to think the next step is running for governor.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not likely. But given their bench, Republicans could do worse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Message No: ..ACCN: 00042160</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: GRAPHIC-DRAWING: SACRAMENTO</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 57s "}}

But Obama is a Democrat, beloved by the glassy-eyed media as a symbol of hope and change, even if guys from Chicago's City Hall run his administration. So the gaffe will  soon wash over him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it's that other screw-up that is most illuminating -- the one that was overshadowed by his unfortunate Special Olympics wisecrack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama told Jay Leno he was surprised that those greedy AIG executives who helped lead the country into financial ruin were in line to receive $165 million in bonuses paid for by bailout cash authorized by his administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Stunned, stunned is the word,\" said Obama.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that his Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- who didn't pay all of his federal taxes but was still deemed worthy by Obama of collecting yours -- knew all about the AIG bonuses weeks ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was long before Washington Democrats began shrieking in pretend outrage over the bonuses, as if they didn't vote for them, sort of like Chicago aldermen shrieking about corruption from the 5th Floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's like Mayor Richard Daley saying, \"Gee, I dunno\" when news breaks that his nephews are in another multimillion-dollar government deal. Or that time that Daley gave $100 million in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> contracts to men he knows well, yet was stunned to learn later that they were white guys, not black females.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These days, the Washington Way is looking just like the Chicago Way. Those of us from Illinois can see it, what with City Hall guys pulling White House strings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then again, we're not surprised because we don't get the high-grade Hopium out here in the Midwest. The good stuff must be reserved for the Beltway media establishment, since they're the ones feeling  tingles running up their legs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet even they'll figure out that the Chicago Way runs along Pennsylvania Avenue, once the Hopium wears off and the tingling stops. It'll probably take about eight years for their heads to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the meantime, all last week, the ludicrous Angry-Democrat-vs.-Greedy-AIG slapstick was highly entertaining, except when you realize the premise of the joke is that American taxpayers are so stupid we'll believe anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she'd tax those arrogant AIG guys and take the money back. This is the same Pelosi who is extremely wealthy, worth millions,  yet she jets coast to coast on weekends on your dime, because she's the speaker. Why doesn't she buy her own jet and have the unemployed AIG guys serve drinks to the real estate lobbyists?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At her news conference Thursday, Pelosi became so upset over AIG questions that she cut off reporters by saying, \"New subject, or else,\" and naturally, being under the influence of primo Hopium, they changed the subject.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But all this false congressional outrage and shrieking and fingerpointing should be understood for what it really is: Political buttocks-covering by Democrats who are worried about the 2010 elections, and afraid of losing their greatest symbolic weapon: The Evil Rich Guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's another cartoon, like Mr. Burns on \"The Simpsons,\" who steps on the backs of the humble working man. Now, though, the Democrats aren't fighting Mr. Burns, they're giving him a boost so he can step on our necks with a pair of snazzy AIG loafers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What they're trying to drown out with all their screaming is that the Democrats knew all about the $165 million to the AIG suits. And the Obama White House knew all about it too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, it was a rather brave New York Democrat, Rep. Joseph Crowley, who asked Geithner about the AIG bonuses in a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee. Not yesterday, or a couple days ago, but on March 3.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just last month,\" Crowley told Geithner, \"AIG paid 343 employees of AIG FP -- their Financial Products division that created the financial hole that AIG is in, and in turn a multibillion-dollar bill for American taxpayers -- $56 million in bonuses and are slated to pay an additional $162 million in bonuses to 393 participants in the coming weeks,\" Crowley said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"And there's more,\" Crowley said. \"Further bonus payments totaling approximately $230 million are due to 407 participants at AIG's Financial Products division in March 2010. This makes no sense to my constituency.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it makes perfect sense back here, where we get only that  weak schwag Hopium. They cut the deal in some back room, and Geithner is being measured as the fall guy. It sounds just like Chicago's City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm stunned, really.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned is the word.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: Photo: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who testified on Capitol Hill this month, knew all about the millions in bonuses for American International Group Inc. executives weeks ago.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/419118450.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>FINDING MR. RIGHT AT THE POLLS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Internet has made it easier than ever to find information, buy books, communicate with people all over the world, and goof off at work. Now it promises to simplify a dreary task that looms before us this year: choosing a president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No, it does not provide the sort of \"help\" offered by glad- handing office-seekers who are eager to enumerate their heroic virtues and inspiring achievements--and to mournfully recite the many ways in which every single one of their opponents falls short. Between now and November, we will have plenty of middle-age men in blue suits doing their utmost to talk us into making a decision congenial to their interests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you would prefer to make a decision congenial to your interests, you can consult a couple of Web sites that serve the function for politics that the personal ads serve for romance: matching compatible partners. They give you questionnaires asking your views on various national issues, tabulate your answers, and tell you with whom you are most likely to find long-term happiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of these is selectsmart.com, where the range of choices goes from Pat Buchanan to Ralph Nader, though it also includes all the sane people in the race. Candidates you have probably never heard of before, such as David McReynolds and Howard Phillips, are there, and the site provides sufficient candidate information to explain why you have never heard of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The questionnaire asks about abortion, crime, defense, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, education, taxes, foreign policy, and the like. I filled it out and was presented with a list of how my views compared with those of the candidates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the top of my list was Harry Browne, a Libertarian Party candidate who scored 89 on a scale of 100. No argument there: I voted for Browne in 1996, and I may do so again, more to express my general outlook on policy than because I really want his finger on the nuclear button. Tied for second were Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch (61), followed by George W. Bush and Steve Forbes, both at 53.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Equally interesting was finding out who would be most likely to cause me to emigrate to Canada should he ever get to the Oval Office. Moving down the list, I learned that I should vote for Donald Trump over Bill Bradley, and that my views would be better represented in the White House by David McReynolds, a Socialist, than by Al Gore. Only Warren Beatty, it seems, is further from my thinking than the vice president. Somehow, this last revelation did not come as a surprise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over at presidentmatch.com, the options are limited to candidates of the two major parties, and after I answered the quiz, I was informed that Alan Keyes and I were made for each other. Next was Steve Forbes, followed by George Bush. Coming in last, the blind date from hell, was none other than Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The main disagreement between the two sites was over the other candidates: selectsmart ranked John McCain better for me than Bill Bradley, while presidentmatch said I should run screaming from McCain, unless the only other option is the guy who invented the Internet. So if the contest comes down to Bradley and McCain, I'll have to flip a coin. Or shoot myself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is all useful information, but it falls short of making the choice as easy as filling out the options you want on a new car, and it could be misleading for anyone who takes it too seriously. The matchmakers pay little attention to some important issues, like the federal budget, missile defense, letting China into the World Trade Organization, and the use of metal bats in baseball (Bush, bless him, would allow wood only).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matters like experience in office get little weight, which makes Forbes and Browne look better than they really are. Temperament and political skills, in which Bush and Bradley might contrast favorably with Gary Bauer or Orrin Hatch, are not considered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason Alan Keyes and I are classified as compatible is that neither President Match nor Select Smart gave me the chance to express my reluctance to vote for someone who appears to be out of his mind. Select Smart put Pat Buchanan in the middle of the pack for me, even though I would sooner pinch Mike Tyson on the bottom than vote for a raving anti-Semite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's something to be said for forcing yourself to contemplate which policies you favor--and for finding out whether the candidate you are drawn to for one reason or another is actually one who would head in the direction you want to go. By focusing on issues of substance, the quizzes are a good antidote to McCain's biography, Bradley's NBA career, Bush's rakish grin, and Gore's . . . well, Gore is probably his own antidote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So if you want to make an intelligent choice in this election, you could do worse than to answer one of these questionnaires. And if you end up voting for Harry Browne, don't blame me.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 13s "}}

Al \"The Mushroom\" Grzyb picked up his own phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a small miracle because the call lasted only 20 seconds. But that was long enough for him to explain that he didn't know anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't know anything about the Duffs and Waste Management and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And he didn't have any opinion on how the tough pink guys got $100 million in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> contracts through Mayor Richard Daley's administration. That's odd, since he was Daley's purchasing agent for 11 years, and he was the political firing pin on just about every political deal benefiting Daley's cronies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just so you know, if there's anything you have, I haven't read anything about it,\" Grzyb said nervously.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I knew it! That's big news right there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb is obviously a loyal Sun-Times reader. They buried the Duff story Tuesday. Perhaps they didn't have a new logo they could use to claim it as their own--say a photo of the Duffs drinking with Daley at their legendary Como Inn Christmas parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And TV isn't interested in the Duff story much, either. The news broke Monday afternoon as federal prosecutors released court documents outlining their case against the Duffs. A TV reporter who has said publicly that he's not afraid of angering Daley explained why TV isn't interested. He'd like to do the Duff story, really, but there are no \"visuals.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he meant is that there are no cars in it, or trucks, things that go \"vrrooom\" with lights flashing and so on in the file tape. That's TV news for you. There's not much video excitement in a contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I thought that $100 million to white guys with Outfit connections who allegedly pretend to be minorities--and convinced their buddy Rich Daley of it too--is an interesting story, especially with the Duff federal fraud trial weeks away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm not with the city anymore,\" Grzyb said, as if we didn't know, since we called him at Elzie Higginbottom's business office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom's company, East Lake Management, ran that building at 69 W. Washington St., where six people died after being trapped in a stairwell with locked doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom is a Daley guy, and Grzyb needed a soft place to land after he got too hot for City Hall. It's nice to know that Higginbottom's office can protect at least one person from heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb, whose name means \"mushroom\" in Polish, was asked about the Duff-Waste Management-Blue Bag deal that the U.S. attorney's office outlined in federal court filings this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my reading of the documents, here's how it played out: A City Hall underling figured out that the Duffs were not minorities, then had the audacity to deny their minority certification on the Blue Bag contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sensing a grave injustice by being denied an opportunity to become minorities, one of the Duffs discussed this blatant discrimination with a top trucking boss and a Waste Management official and a \"City Official A.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon, Troy Ratliff, a deputy of Grzyb's, overruled the underlings. Grzyb approved the Duff contract for workers to sort out recyclable garbage for Waste Management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any opinions on it,\" Grzyb said. \"I don't work for the city anymore. If you have any questions, call the city's press office.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb has been at the center of other deals for Daley. And he was never brought before the Chicago City Council for confirmation, because he didn't have the proper credentials under the State Purchasing Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he had the one credential that counts. He knew how to say yes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grzyb? Who was the Waste Management official you met with on the Duff deal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any comment,\" Grzyb said. \"That's it. Thank you.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mushroom then hung up the phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He wasn't the only non-chatty type Tuesday. The mayor says he hates corruption. But he had nothing to say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"First of all, I'm not going to comment on it, it's a pending [federal] case,\" the mayor told me, a bit peeved, which is his usual expression when I come within 1,200 yards of him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I know nothing about it, I tell you,\" Daley insisted. \"I know nothing about it, any other questions?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've been critical of the Duff-Daley deal, but now it might be time to reconsider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We Americans tell our children they can grow up to be anything, from cowboys to astronauts. So why can't the white guy Duffs aspire to minority status, even if it's only on paper, and even if they are white men?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What kind of a country do we live in, anyway? Is this the land of opportunity, or is it not?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least at Chicago's City Hall, miracles do happen, sometimes.

In his 1994 book, \"Politically Incorrect: The Emerging Faith Factor in American Politics,\" he wrote that historical cooperation with slavery and segregation \"undermined the moral authority of religious conservatives as they have sought to redress other forms of social injustice--abortion, euthanasia, religious bigotry--in recent times.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To plug the gap, the coalition has announced Samaritan Project, a multiracial program to rejuvenate low-income, inner-city neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Headed by an African-American, the Rev. Earl Jackson, the coalition's national liaison for community development, the Samaritan Project offers compassionate conservatives a chance to put their money where their mouths are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among other ideas, it proposes a new multiracial partnership to revitalize local churches and rejuvenate the national debate on racial justice. It commits the coalition's members and its network of 125,000 churches to raise funds for partnerships with 1,000 inner-city churches by 2000, particularly for those churches which are helping at-risk youths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On racial justice, the coalition plans a May conference in Baltimore to which black and white church leaders from across the nation are invited to hammer out an agenda for cooperation \"across racial and cultural lines.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a conference call with me and six other newspaper columnists last week, Reed and Jackson said the project was inspired by the organization's successful call for white churches to help rebuild black churches destroyed in last year's wave of church burnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Reed and Jackson said, they have raised $850,000 and given away most of it in grants averaging $20,000 per church to 40 congregations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"African-American leaders were far more receptive than I ever thought possible,\" Reed said. \"I never asked people whether they were Democratic or Republican or liberal or conservative. It has changed us. God took a tragedy and turned it into something good.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The help could hardly go to a better place. The black church has been the African-American community's most durable and liberating institution through times much tougher than these. Black church leaders were the core of the abolitionist movement, the civil rights movement and countless independent, self-help neighborhood housing and social service programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, their successes usually wind up on the back pages of local newspapers, if at all, making a very small blip on the media's or the public's radar screens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Christian Coalition can bring the communications network that can help black churches feel less isolated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It can also bring about public attention that can help change society's prevailing cynicism about the ability of poor people to help themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Publicity does have its virtues. Assignment editors who yawn at the efforts of a little church here or there suddenly perk up when Ralph Reed holds a press conference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the less noble side, there is no question that conservatives hope the Samaritan Project will improve not only their moral authority but also their political clout. In return, the coalition hopes it can win black support for an array of ideas liberal leaders tend to oppose: school vouchers, a tax credit (not just a deduction) for charitable donations, tax breaks to encourage business investments in depressed areas and vouchers for schools and drug rehabilitation programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each of these ideas is currently being proposed in various forms in the House by Oklahoma's J.C. Watts, Congress' only black Republican, and in the Senate by Republican Daniel Coats of Indiana.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So be it. Black church leaders will have to decide for themselves whether the Samaritan Project is manna from Heaven or a Trojan horse. In the meantime, I am delighted, after years of racially polarized national politics, to see conservatives compete with liberals for black support. It's also refreshing to see churches take the lead again for racial reconciliation. We can use a few miracles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustrtion by David Csicsko.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 15s "}}

It may seem counterintuitive to suggest that the Caucus should support the passage of legislation that targets the rich for a tax reduction. But a meaningful capital gains tax cut will help those of us in the black community who are helping to create jobs for middle- and working-class people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Passage of a capital gains tax cut will stimulate economic growth by freeing up capital for new investments, including venture capital investments in black-controlled companies, thereby creating jobs for the constituents of CBC members. In the long run, policies that increase the availability of investment capital for entrepreneurial endeavors could completely eliminate the need for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Venture capital, which would receive a big boost from a capital gains tax cut, is a proven method of creating jobs. The most recent study by Venture One Corporation and the National Venture Capital Association found that 495 venture-capital-backed companies generated 75,240 new U.S. jobs between 1989 and 1993. It also found $2 billion of export sales were generated by the same companies. The CBC needs to become a more active and vocal advocate of the black business community in general and the flow of investment capital to black business in particular. As welfare reform increases the pressure on disadvantaged blacks in the inner cities of America, policies that stimulate black business growth are needed to provide opportunities for those coming off the welfare rolls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the moment, the private equity business, with more than $170 billion under management as of year-end 1994 (according to Private Equity Analyst estimates), flourishes with capital contributions from public pensions funds, corporate pension plans, banks and insurance companies. But very little of that capital has been directed to black firms. It is a national problem that deserves national attention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond simply cutting capital gains taxes, there are other measures the government can take to help black-owned busineses. Two initiatives come to mind, both of which can be initiated by the administration without additional legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, since the Labor Department regulates pension funds and has the responsibility to issue interpretations of regulations, Secretary Robert Reich could issue interpretations of current pension fund policies to encourage them to invest in black-owned businesses. The second initiative should be aimed at getting the brokerage industry to raise money for the black companies. With approximately $1 trillion raised each year by the U.S. brokerage industry for American businesses, it would be good business for the major brokerage firms to tap the capital markets on behalf of black businesses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But none of this is a substitute for a capital gains tax cut. The effect on black-controlled businesses would be to greatly increase the flow of venture capital in the form of equity to such businesses. This decade has seen for the first time genuine interest being expressed by the institutional investment community in making venture capital investments in black businesses. Substantially all black-controlled companies are privately held, and are precisely the type of firms that would benefit from an increased infusion of venture capital from institutions and wealthy individuals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A good indication of the impact that such investments can have on black employment lies in a 1993 Wall Street Journal survey, which found that 60% of all black businesses employ a work force at least 70% black. With a badly needed infusion of equity capital to allow them to expand, black firms would create more jobs for the substantially black constituency base of CBC members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are other benefits for the CBC in a capital gains tax cut. It would enable the lawmakers to replace the narrowly targeted broadcast properties tax incentive recently struck down by the Republican majority in Congress with a tax incentive that would benefit all industries in which black businesses operate. It would also enable the CBC to form a unique alliance with the Republican Congress to enact legislation that will help all Americans, including black Americans. Such an alliance would position the CBC as a dynamic voting bloc and its members as leaders able to deliver for their constituents by skillfully adapting to the changing political environment. This would most certainly increase the value of the CBC vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Granger is president of Ark Capital Management in Chicago.

Gov. Joe Rogers are trotted out like trophies, an attractive serving of political correctness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up in a black Republican family. My father was a delegate from Kansas to the 1964 GOP convention. On our way to the convention in San Francisco, we were run off the road in Arizona by a car with John Birch Society bumper stickers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was only 14, but I couldn't understand my father's party loyalty. Yet when I watched him walk to the podium at the Cow Palace and give then-Pennsylvania Gov. William Scranton's seconding speech, I experienced the contradiction. I felt proud even though I knew that the Republicans had soundly defeated a proposal to strengthen the civil rights plank with pledges for speedy school desegregation, full voting rights and elimination of job bias.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Was my father flawed?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the years, I have observed that most African Americans in the Republican Party care less about identity politics than their counterparts in the Democratic Party. My father's mantra was the business of self-reliance, doing for yourself rather than waiting for the government. And his lectures to me were on how blacks must be active in both political parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in 2000, the reasons some blacks join the Republican Party are more complicated. Thirty years ago, my father, along with other civil rights activists such as then-Assistant Secretary of Labor Art Fletcher, were building a legacy. They demonstrated a commitment to the black community. Fletcher's Philadelphia Plan under Richard Nixon's presidency increased the opportunities for minorities and women to compete in the job market. The Philadelphia Plan made federal contractors meet specific goals in hiring women and minorities, the forerunner of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now, many black Republicans just enjoy unsettling people. Sound bites and big hats. Others like Rogers state that they have chosen to take the \"road less traveled.\" And as I listened to him in a debate with Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) at the recent National Assn. of Black Journalists convention, I recognized the advantages of not going where the competition is fierce. For the truly politically ambitious, there appears to be an impressive list of Democratic wannabes. Why queue up behind a long line of well- established power brokers?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At that same time, however, I saw someone who was brave enough to stand up to a polite but solid wall of contempt from the black audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was never that brave. Although I was a black Republican until my father died in 1983, I only took advantage of his sweat equity. I inserted myself into the 1976 GOP convention in Kansas City and worked in the press office handling media relations for the black delegates and party leaders. In the early 1980s, because of my father and good political contacts, I was offered a public affairs position in Washington, D.C.. I was seduced by the image of power, politics and press initially, but after two weeks of trying out D.C. with interviews, meetings and receptions, I declined the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was changing and developing different political values. I observed that the era of black Republicans like my father had passed. And what I saw in its place was no longer for me. I left the party to become a Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those early days, I had considered myself a pragmatist by being Republican. Although my friends labeled me an opportunist, I rationalized that everything was a boost for my career. My commitment, however, was only to my father. Never did I reflect his loyalty to the Republican Party. Neither do the black Republicans I see today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My father had a faith in his party and its potential. He wanted to make a contribution for black people, to stand up and be counted even when it was dangerous. It was his personal honesty. It was his fine flaw.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sharon Woodson-Bryant is a Burbank freelance writer</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 19s "}}

The experiences he recounted were \"a source of amazement and inspiration,\" she wrote, not only for what they revealed about him \"but also because of what they instill in, and ask, of us.\" She said she found herself \"hoping to hear, just once more, another story that would, by and by, perhaps change the way I see the world.\"I was touched by the essay when I first read it, but also puzzled. If I had been asked to name justices who were immune to Thurgood Marshall's influence, Justice O'Connor, who had been on the court for 11 years and had served with him for 10 years, would have been on the list. She opposed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and her states'-rights orientation made her antagonistic to federal court review of state criminal justice issues. I was taken aback by her first line in a 1991 majority opinion that rejected an appeal from an inmate on Virginia's death row. \"This is a case about federalism,\" she declared. Justice Marshall dissented.And yet. By the time of her own retirement in 2006, Justice O'Connor was in a very different place. She wrote the majority opinion that preserved <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in university admissions. She modulated her views on federalism. It would be ridiculous to ascribe Justice O'Connor's migration in late middle age solely to the influence of Justice Marshall, who died in 1993. But it would be equally ridiculous to discount his influence entirely. Why not take her at her word? She must have sensed something in 1992, a pull in a different direction.Could President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, assuming her confirmation, inspire any of her new colleagues to see the world in a different way?There doesn't seem to be a Sandra Day O'Connor lurking within today's carefully constructed conservative supermajority, and the heroic trajectory of Thurgood Marshall's life is not Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's story. It's fair to say that she has more in common with the justice she has been named to replace. Like Stephen Breyer, she was a star student at an excellent public high school. Her father, like his, worked as a lawyer for a big-city school board (Miami in her case, San Francisco in his). Success at Harvard Law School propelled them both to a Supreme Court clerkship (in fact, she clerked for him). Justice Breyer is often referred to as the father of the federal sentencing guidelines and served on the original United States Sentencing Commission, where she later served as vice chair.In drawing these parallels, I have deliberately not emphasized race. Yes, her nomination fulfills the president's campaign promise to appoint a Black woman, the first to sit on the Supreme Court. While that's cause for celebration, it shouldn't obscure the other kinds of diversity she would bring to the court.Diversity has many dimensions, perspective among them. That she would be the first former public defender to sit on the court has received wide notice, less so the fact that as a public school graduate she would be a rarity among the justices. Justice Breyer's departure will leave only two, Elena Kagan, who attended the highly selective Hunter College High School in Manhattan, hardly a typical public school, and Samuel Alito, who went to Steinert High School in Hamilton Township, N.J., near Trenton, his hometown. Every other member of the court is a graduate of a Catholic high school, a striking but little-observed fact at a time when cases concerning public and religious schools and the relationship between the two are prominent on the court's docket.Justice Breyer's wife, Joanna, is a clinical psychologist who during her active career specialized in working with children being treated for cancer at the Lahey Clinic in Boston. Does having a medical professional in the family account for Justice Breyer's emphasis on facts and evidence in his opinions on medical subjects? With medical questions hardly about to disappear from the court's docket, it's worth noting that Judge Jackson's husband, Patrick, is a surgeon. (Justice Sonia Sotomayor's brother, Juan, is a doctor with an allergy practice in upstate New York.) Some conservative justices seem to assume that doctors don't act in the interest of their patients, whether performing abortions or administering vaccines. Maybe Judge Jackson will be able to persuade them otherwise.Or maybe not, but my point is that we cheat ourselves out of a full appreciation of what a person brings to the court if race is our only focus. On the day of Judge Jackson's nomination, Curt Levey, president of the right-wing interest group Committee for Justice, put out a statement that was as preposterous as it was predictable. \"Jackson should be asked about her views on race,\" the statement said, adding that \"at a time when a major <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> case is on the Supreme Court's docket and our nation is debating whether equality or equity should be the governing anti-discrimination standard, we hope that senators will ask Judge Jackson about her views on equity, racial preferences, disparate impact and the like.\"Maybe it's only white nominees who are not expected to answer questions about pending cases. Maybe I missed other news releases from the Committee for Justice, but I don't remember Mr. Levey asking senators to drill down on the views on racial issues held by President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court nominees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Don't white Supreme Court nominees also have a race?Thurgood Marshall, born into segregation in 1908, was already a Supreme Court justice when Ketanji Brown was born 62 years later. She will walk through the doors that he opened. But her life story is not without power.

Her teenage dream was to be a judge. By 2012, when the country had a president determined to diversify the federal courts, Judge Jackson had walked through every open door and was ready for Barack Obama.It's a quintessentially American success story. Thinking about what her role on the court might be, is it fanciful to suppose that some of her colleagues, age mates who checked the same boxes on their way to the top, might look at Ketanji Brown Jackson and see themselves? Perhaps in the very familiarity of her path to the Supreme Court -- a story that to others might look extraordinary -- might lie its ability to inspire, or at least to prompt conservatives who are sure of what they think to think again.

It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department.

Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.
