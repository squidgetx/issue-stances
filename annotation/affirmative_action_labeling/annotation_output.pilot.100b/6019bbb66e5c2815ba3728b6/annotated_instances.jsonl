They then invoked an obscure Senate rule that required the judicial candidates to be re-nominated. (Yes, these are the same Republicans who used to loudly demand that every one of President George W. Bush's nominees get a vote on the Senate floor, regardless of their qualifications.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most prominent of the five repeaters is Goodwin Liu, a law professor and legal scholar who would be the only Asian-American serving as an active judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Liu went to Stanford, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and graduated from Yale Law School. He clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before beginning a teaching career at the University of California, Berkeley,  School of Law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, it is largely his stellar background that is fueling Republican opposition. Mr. Liu, who is 39, is seen as a strong possibility to be on President Obama's short list for a future Supreme Court vacancy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives do not like Mr. Liu's support for same-sex marriage rights, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and his view that the Constitution is a living document that evolves over time. But his views fall well within the legal and political mainstream. His warnings that Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel Alito would turn out to be extremely conservative were accurate. But Mr. Liu is no rigid liberal ideologue, as his support of school vouchers and charter schools attest. Kenneth Starr, the conservative lawyer who investigated President Bill Clinton, co-signed a letter vouching for Mr. Liu's \"independence and openness to diverse viewpoints.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be nice if some Republican members of the Judiciary Committee voted for Mr. Liu and the four other re-nominees (along with three other new nominees). Whether they do or not, the White House and Senate Democrats should persist in fighting for their confirmation and the confirmation of the 16 other pending nominees already approved by the committee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the comparable point in the Bush presidency, the Senate had confirmed 61.4 percent of Mr. Bush's nominees. For Mr. Obama, it's under 50 percent. His nominees are no radicals. That description applies to Republicans holding up well-qualified choices like Mr. Liu.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}

But Obama is a Democrat, beloved by the glassy-eyed media as a symbol of hope and change, even if guys from Chicago's City Hall run his administration. So the gaffe will  soon wash over him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it's that other screw-up that is most illuminating -- the one that was overshadowed by his unfortunate Special Olympics wisecrack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama told Jay Leno he was surprised that those greedy AIG executives who helped lead the country into financial ruin were in line to receive $165 million in bonuses paid for by bailout cash authorized by his administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Stunned, stunned is the word,\" said Obama.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that his Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- who didn't pay all of his federal taxes but was still deemed worthy by Obama of collecting yours -- knew all about the AIG bonuses weeks ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was long before Washington Democrats began shrieking in pretend outrage over the bonuses, as if they didn't vote for them, sort of like Chicago aldermen shrieking about corruption from the 5th Floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's like Mayor Richard Daley saying, \"Gee, I dunno\" when news breaks that his nephews are in another multimillion-dollar government deal. Or that time that Daley gave $100 million in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> contracts to men he knows well, yet was stunned to learn later that they were white guys, not black females.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These days, the Washington Way is looking just like the Chicago Way. Those of us from Illinois can see it, what with City Hall guys pulling White House strings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then again, we're not surprised because we don't get the high-grade Hopium out here in the Midwest. The good stuff must be reserved for the Beltway media establishment, since they're the ones feeling  tingles running up their legs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet even they'll figure out that the Chicago Way runs along Pennsylvania Avenue, once the Hopium wears off and the tingling stops. It'll probably take about eight years for their heads to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the meantime, all last week, the ludicrous Angry-Democrat-vs.-Greedy-AIG slapstick was highly entertaining, except when you realize the premise of the joke is that American taxpayers are so stupid we'll believe anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she'd tax those arrogant AIG guys and take the money back. This is the same Pelosi who is extremely wealthy, worth millions,  yet she jets coast to coast on weekends on your dime, because she's the speaker. Why doesn't she buy her own jet and have the unemployed AIG guys serve drinks to the real estate lobbyists?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At her news conference Thursday, Pelosi became so upset over AIG questions that she cut off reporters by saying, \"New subject, or else,\" and naturally, being under the influence of primo Hopium, they changed the subject.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But all this false congressional outrage and shrieking and fingerpointing should be understood for what it really is: Political buttocks-covering by Democrats who are worried about the 2010 elections, and afraid of losing their greatest symbolic weapon: The Evil Rich Guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's another cartoon, like Mr. Burns on \"The Simpsons,\" who steps on the backs of the humble working man. Now, though, the Democrats aren't fighting Mr. Burns, they're giving him a boost so he can step on our necks with a pair of snazzy AIG loafers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What they're trying to drown out with all their screaming is that the Democrats knew all about the $165 million to the AIG suits. And the Obama White House knew all about it too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, it was a rather brave New York Democrat, Rep. Joseph Crowley, who asked Geithner about the AIG bonuses in a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee. Not yesterday, or a couple days ago, but on March 3.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just last month,\" Crowley told Geithner, \"AIG paid 343 employees of AIG FP -- their Financial Products division that created the financial hole that AIG is in, and in turn a multibillion-dollar bill for American taxpayers -- $56 million in bonuses and are slated to pay an additional $162 million in bonuses to 393 participants in the coming weeks,\" Crowley said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"And there's more,\" Crowley said. \"Further bonus payments totaling approximately $230 million are due to 407 participants at AIG's Financial Products division in March 2010. This makes no sense to my constituency.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it makes perfect sense back here, where we get only that  weak schwag Hopium. They cut the deal in some back room, and Geithner is being measured as the fall guy. It sounds just like Chicago's City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm stunned, really.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned is the word.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: Photo: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who testified on Capitol Hill this month, knew all about the millions in bonuses for American International Group Inc. executives weeks ago.

{"id": "test_question_pro_testing_1", "displayed_text": "<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

This has sparked much Monday- morning quarterbacking among industry groups and industry-funded folks as to what went wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This issue should have been a 'gimme' for the administration,\" former Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow Jonathan Adler e-mailed CEI President Fred Smith last week, insisting the merits of the issue favored the White House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Despite this . . . the administration got hammered and will continue to get hammered,\" Adler said, by enviros and \"pundits who know less about environmental law than [Environmental Protection Agency chief Christine Todd] Whitman (and that's saying something).\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem? \"Poor communication,\" writes Adler. That plus \"the utter intellectual vacuity and laziness of environmental journalists,\" he said. \"If the arsenic issue cannot be 'won,' it will be hard to win anything that matters.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus the quick turnaround on the pro-salmonella proposal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adler's e-mail notes people should have stressed that there were \"no industry beneficiaries\" in voiding the Clinton move and that there was still a federal arsenic regulation in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enviros such as Elliott Negin of the Natural Resources Defense Council, however, insists the problem was that the facts didn't back the Bush team. Negin said, for example, the Environmental Arsenic Council, a trade group of chemical, oil and mining companies, staunchly opposed the new standard already adopted by the Europeans - - and the old federal standard was adopted in 1942, before it was known that arsenic was a carcinogen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Adler may be right about this. People cringe at the word \"arsenic.\" Industry must level the playing field and rename arsenic. Perhaps \"Rosewater?\" Or \"Passion Mist?\" Maybe \"Old Lace?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What happened to those guys who came up with \"fecal matter?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And now, the first of a likely endless string of fundraisers and political to-dos at the Clinton home in Northwest. Our invite from all the Democratic women senators says they're holding a \"special reception honoring\" Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who's pretty much broke these days and owes a large chunk of change from her campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's on April 25 and only $1,000 a ticket. But there's a problem for all those well-heeled PAC folks. It's \"Personal checks only.\" So if you want to see maison Clinton and those new decorations, it's going to come out of your pocket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember the Dan Burton cuff links on eBay for $9.99 that got no bids for five days? Sold! For $50.86 after 21 bids, to a bidder named \"fostervince.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bush said Friday that he would name Charles A. Heimbold Jr., deputy chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, to be ambassador to Sweden.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the early front-runner for Rome, Rockwell Schnabel, is said to have faded of late, and Charles Gargano, a favorite of the Italian American lobby, is moving out front. Another name heard in the mix is former New Jersey representative William J. Martini (R).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Roger Noriega, a top aide to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), is said to be the front- runner for ambassador to the Organization of American States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> here, the Bush administration says, but even so, 40 percent of Bush's announcements for top-tier positions -- those requiring Senate confirmation -- have been women and minorities, according to a review of Bush's first 158 picks by the Brookings Presidential Appointee Initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 25 percent of Bush's picks have been women and 20 percent are minorities: 11.4 percent are African American, 3.2 percent are Hispanic and 5.1 percent are Asian.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This compares to President Clinton's 37 percent women and 15 percent African Americans, according to a 1993 Knight Ridder study.

We want an equal shot regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or disability, and in this nation of laws that should be assured. But like the speed limit, such laws mean nothing unless they are strictly enforced, so a proposal by the Clinton administration to boost civil rights enforcement could make a real difference. Employers, contractors, mortgage lenders and landlords would make more decisions in a truly impartial manner if failure to do so had surer and quicker consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That racial barriers persist is unquestionable. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissent against a 1995 decision concerning <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, was eloquent in describing them: \"Racial inequality . . . and discrimination's lingering effects . . . are evident in our workplaces, markets and neighborhoods. Job applicants with identical resumes, qualifications, and interview styles still experience different receptions, depending on their race. White and African American consumers still encounter different deals. People of color looking for housing still face discriminatory treatment by landlords, real estate agents and mortgage lenders.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House plan, if approved by Congress, would increase civil rights funding 17%, from $516 million to $602 million. Some Republicans may object to any increase in government. The political opposition is harder to figure. How can opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, who say they only want equal opportunity, reject tougher enforcement of existing laws enforcing equality?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A current barrier to enforcement is the overworked, underbudgeted and understaffed federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Clinton proposal would increase funding by $37 million to reduce the backlog of 64,000 cases and encourage more use of mediation, which is a quicker and less costly method of resolving disputes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's civil rights division, overseer of laws governing employment, housing, education and public accommodations, would get an 11% funding increase. To discourage housing bias, the White House would increase Housing and Urban Development Department funding by $22 million, among other things making possible the hiring of more \"testers\"--applicants identical on paper but of different racial backgrounds. Their visits to landlords and real estate agents often uncover wide disparities and are the best possible measure of compliance with fair housing laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Clinton seeks to engage the nation in a debate on the divisive issue of race. Dialogue is important, but actions speak louder. Strict and timely enforcement of civil rights laws will give more people the fair shot that each of us deserves.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 32s "}}

And they never seem to end.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Paris protesters are getting all the attention, but France isn't the only country where angry masses are taking to the streets to be heard.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Journal reported Monday that an estimated 55,000 people gathered in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur last weekend to defend race-based policies that give preferential treatment to the majority Muslim Malay population. Defenders argue that ending racial preferences would \"dilute decades of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies introduced to help Malays catch up with the generally wealthier ethnic Chinese,\" who comprise less than a quarter of the population.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> in Malaysia began in the 1950s, after the British colonial administrators, who had welcomed laborers from China, departed. Since 1971, Malays have enjoyed preferential treatment over their Chinese compatriots in everything from schooling and housing to government jobs and access to capital. The government's express goal was \"racial balance,\" and to that end Malay entrepreneurs were given preference in obtaining credit, licenses and government contracts. Developers offer Malays discounts on new homes, and shopping centers have even banned ethnic-Chinese-owned businesses to limit competition with Malay proprietors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These policies were supposed to sunset in 1991, but the country's leaders have repeatedly extended them in exchange for political support. \"Schemes favouring Malays were once deemed essential to improve the lot of Malaysia's least wealthy racial group,\" explains the Economist magazine, but \"these days they are widely thought to help mostly the well-off within that group, while failing the poor and aggravating ethnic tensions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To anyone who has followed the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> debate in the U.S., a lot of this probably sounds familiar. Like their Malay counterparts, American proponents of racial double standards say they are necessary to help the underprivileged, even though the beneficiaries tend to be people who were already well-off to begin with. Liberal politicians defend color-conscious policies to win votes, and courts assure us the policies will not exist in perpetuity. \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,\" wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in a 2003 Supreme Court decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it has in Malaysia, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> continues to stoke racial and ethnic tensions in the U.S., especially in education. Harvard is being sued for discrimination against Asian applicants. The plaintiffs say Asians are held to higher standards than other applicants to limit their numbers on campus. Harvard insists that more Asians aren't admitted because they aren't as multidimensional as their non-Asian peers, an argument eerily similar to the one Ivy League schools once used to discriminate against Jews.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has angered the parents of white and Asian students by pushing for racial quotas at the city's top public high schools. Some 80% of black and Hispanic students in New York City's traditional public schools perform below grade level in reading and math. Is it really any wonder that black and Hispanic students are underrepresented at elite schools that use an admission test? Unfortunately, the mayor and his supporters would rather scrap the test than focus on doing a better job of preparing kids to take it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the debate domestically often centers on the legality of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and whether it's permitted under our constitution, a more practical concern is whether these policies actually work as intended--here in America or in other countries where they've been implemented. Malaysia's racial preferences have been in place for more than 50 years, and the Malays still haven't caught up to the ethnic Chinese, who outperform them in school and in the workforce. The gap has narrowed over the past half-century, but it remains significant, and attributing Malay progress to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is dubious. For one thing, Malays in neighboring Singapore, which has no <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and where they are a minority, are better off economically than the Malays in Malaysia, who receive favorable treatment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs in the U.S. are regularly given undeserved credit for expanding the size of the black middle class. The reality is that the most dramatic declines in black poverty preceded <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs, which began in earnest in the 1970s. Black incomes doubled in the 1960s--before <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. And blacks were entering middle-class professions at a much faster clip in the decades preceding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than they did in the decades following its implementation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the University of California system ended race-based admissions in 1996, more blacks enrolled and a higher percentage of them not only graduated but obtained degrees in the more challenging fields of engineering and science.

But I probably will never forget his three words of advice:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Make yourself indispensable.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to find three better words that sum up the successful business philosophy of John Harold Johnson, who died Monday at age 87.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To black Americans of my generation, Johnson's publications Ebony, Jet and Negro Digest were indispensable reading matter, offering a brighter and more prosperous vision of black America than most of the mainstream--also known as \"white-owned\"--media provided.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To advertisers, Johnson's pioneering publications broke through the myth that the black consumer market was not worth targeting through black-owned media.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today the newsstands are filled with magazines niche-marketed to blacks or Hispanics, but that really began with Johnson back in the 1940s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And to journalists, particularly black journalists, Johnson's publications provided employment, a training ground and a model for how people of color might be covered in a more complete fashion than simply crime, sports or show business stories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His 1989 autobiography \"Succeeding Against the Odds\" reads almost like a business-school series of case studies in how to solve whatever problems life throws at you.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Arkansas refused to educate black children in his area past the 8th grade, his mother, Gertrude Johnson Williams, a cook and domestic worker, saved for two years to move her family to Chicago in the 1930s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Young Johnnie was working days at a black-owned life insurance company and studying at night at Northwestern University when he started up Negro Digest in 1942 with $500 that his mother raised by borrowing against the family furniture.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When its circulation stalled at 50,000 a few months later, he persisted in requesting a guest column from Eleanor Roosevelt until she agreed, immediately boosting circulation to 100,000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1945, Johnson launched Ebony, a picture magazine for blacks. Its initial press run of 25,000 copies was completely sold out. Pocket-size Jet magazine began in 1951. Jet helped launch the modern civil rights movement in 1955 when it published open-casket funeral photos of the mangled body of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Chicagoan who was savagely murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite its annual special editions focusing thoughtfully on major issues of black politics and economics, we black journalists, among others, often ridiculed the sugar-coated emphasis that Ebony and Jet put on the upwardly ambitious black middle class. Yet we also understood Johnson's reluctance to focus on negative news about black life, since there was so much of that in the mainstream media.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bourgeois flavor of Johnson's publications was a minor criticism in the life of a man who overcame tremendous hardships to fill an important vacuum in black life and become one of America's wealthiest businessmen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With that in mind, his \"make yourself indispensable\" speech had special resonance. Speaking to his audience of predominately young and aspiring print and broadcast journalists, he offered us the example of Matthew Henson, the black man who helped Adm. Robert Peary reach the North Pole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Henson was not hired under any <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> plan or out of the goodness of Peary's heart, Johnson pointed out. Henson was hired because he had taken the time to learn the language of the Inuit people, who were indispensable to their journey.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Johnson did not mention was the equally fascinating story of how he gave an autographed copy of Henson's autobiography to Zenith Electronics Corp. chief executive officer Eugene McDonald, after hearing that McDonald was a fan of arctic explorers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McDonald was impressed enough by the gift and by a four-page Ebony feature on Henson that Zenith became Ebony's first major corporate advertiser in the 1950s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He helped persuade other major corporate advertisers to follow, a major breakthrough at the time for black-oriented media. Two decades later, Johnson was elected to Zenith's board of directors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Johnson's career was full of stories like that. His life presents case studies in leadership, which is, above all, the art of problem solving. While others might fret, moan or whine, he was a get-it- done kind of guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He understood that no one, black or otherwise, would patronize your business purely out of racial loyalty. Consumers in a free market want value, service and quality. He set a high standard for all three. Despite the changing times that his publications helped to bring about, he found ways to stay indispensable. So must we all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clarence Page is a member of the Tribune's editorial board.

Pete Wilson turns 85 tomorrow, so on behalf of all Californians, I say: gracias. (That's \"thank you\" in Spanish, Pedro.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for your 30-plus years of service as a public official -- first, as an assemblyman for San Diego, then as the mayor of that city, followed by two terms apiece as our U.S. senator and governor. Your career helped shaped the modern-day Golden State.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a career mostly defined by a moderate approach -- an important lesson for the Democrats and Republicans of today that too few bother to remember.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a mayoral career that saw you protect San Diego's wetlands and implement <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> hiring practices. \"He believes that America's minorities have been handicapped for years,\" one campaign flier read, \"by inadequate housing, education and job opportunities, and he has dedicated his efforts to alleviating these problems.\" That's a reality that more Republicans should acknowledge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for being so hurt when the Republican Party pulled their 1972 convention from San Diego that you responded with an \"America's Finest City\" campaign. You showed second-tier cities across the country that they too should be proud of who they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for proving that Republicans can take the lead in addressing America's prior racial wrongs. As senator, you cosponsored the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which granted reparations and an official government apology to Japanese Americans interned during World War II.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for showing us that a Republican governor could understand that raising taxes to help shore up public finances was a wise thing and not treason. In 1991, when California faced a record deficit, you backed tax increases for sales, the wealthy and even snacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias too for throwing away this record of centrism. (Just bear with me.) You showed future generations of politicians how not to ruin their legacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for helping to deregulate California's electricity, which led to mass blackouts in the beginning of the 2000s and convinced an entire generation that we shouldn't leave public utilities to the private market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for signing the state's three-strikes sentencing laws. The increase in prisoners proved that justice isn't blind but usually racist and always classist, and it planted the first seeds of distrust in law enforcement that have bloomed into a movement across the state today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for working so hard to eliminate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> at the University of California and beyond. The program helped to get thousands of minorities into the middle class, where they promptly retreated into the comforts of whiteness. Your 180-degree turn on the issue radicalized college students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, most of all, for Proposition 187. You didn't author the 1994 measure, which declared war on immigrants in the country illegally and the people who helped them. But you jumped on the 187 bandwagon and took the reins as soon as you could to help resurrect your flagging reelection campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, Mexican Americans like me realized for the first time that a large part of society still considered us \"Mexican\" and not \"American,\" like we always believed ourselves to be. Most of us have identified with the former more than the latter ever since.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, MEChA bounced back. The Chicano high school and college group was slowly losing its power as more Mexican Americans began to identify as \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\" and wanted no part with radical politics. Because of 187, MEChA members went on to reinvigorate the labor movement, introduce ethnic studies in high schools, and make Dia de los Muertos a thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring Latinos to enter politics like never before. And gracias for making the defense of immigrants their rallying cry. From state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra's zeal, to bringing back driver's licenses for the undocumented (which you took away), to declaring us a sanctuary state, it's all a direct response to your cynicism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring two of the most hilarious death-metal songs ever: \"Matando Gueros\" (\"Killing White People\") and \"Raza Odiada\" (\"Hated Race\"), both by Brujeria. I certainly hope that you take their mock-assassination skit as satire at its finest, instead of a bona fide threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for providing the California Republican Party a cautionary tale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inadvertently posing for an airplane selfie two years ago with film director Alex Rivera. Your befuddled expression reminded Latinos that you're not a monster but rather just a confused fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And gracias for still not getting it. At a recent speech by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon to the Southern California Leadership Council, you complained to him that Sacramento \"ignores us,\" whatever the hell that means. (Who's \"us\"?) Speaker Rendon's grace in responding to your petulance -- basically \"I'm here now\" -- was as great an example of Old and New California as Rivera could've scripted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, Governor Pedro. May I suggest a birthday dinner of crow tacos?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>mexicanwithglasses@gmail.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow @GustavoArellano on Twitter</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: PETE WILSON was mayor of San Diego, a U.S. senator and a two-term governor of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Luis Sinco Los Angeles Times</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 53s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/409718670.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Justices Too Tightlipped on Their Health?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the many issues raised by the Supreme Court's recent disclosure that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has cancer is how much information the court owes the public about the chief justice's health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only facts revealed -- that Rehnquist has one of several forms of thyroid cancer and that he received a tracheotomy at Bethesda Naval Hospital before being discharged Friday -- were enough to fuel speculation by medical experts about the 80-year- old's condition but not to settle the most pressing questions about the future of the chief justice, and of the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court's terseness is consistent with its long tradition of discretion concerning justices' personal lives. With few exceptions - - in 1975, after a crippling stroke, Justice William O. Douglas held a news conference -- health information about the life-tenured members of the court is especially closely guarded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tradition was born in the days before the court played a central role in policymaking. But now, when the court has a role in everything from whether race can be considered in college admissions to the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, some are saying that tradition has to change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If the chief justice's medical prognosis is indeed such that he may not be able to finish this term, that's something the American people have a right to know, especially where you have dueling doctors speculating about the meaning of a tracheotomy,\" said David J. Garrow, a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at Emory University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If it were [Speaker of the House] Dennis Hastert or [Senate Minority Leader] Tom Daschle, people would say there is an unchallengeable public right to know as much as the public official himself knows,\" Garrow said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others defended the court's approach. They noted the constitutional differences between the judiciary and the other branches of government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The court operates according to a different rule,\" said Michael A. Carvin, a former Reagan administration Justice Department official. \"There is no constitutional transition issue like you have with the president. There is no day-to-day, commander-in-chief-type responsibility. You can operate the court on autopilot. You can't operate the presidency that way.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also is possible that not even the chief justice is certain about his condition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In my opinion, he owes the public whatever he gives the public,\" said Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper, a former Rehnquist law clerk. \"He may still be finding things out himself.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SWINGER: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role on the court, long a matter of conventional wisdom among lawyers, has been confirmed by the latest quantitative methods of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a forthcoming North Carolina Law Review article, professors Andrew D. Martin, Kevin Quinn and Lee Epstein show not only that O'Connor is the court's \"median voter,\" but also that the 74-year- old has moved steadily to the left in recent years, taking the court with her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of math is involved, but basically the professors ranked justices on a numerical scale, assigning point values to their ideological leanings as shown through their votes. The higher the number, the more conservative the voting record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2002, the last term covered by the study, Justice Clarence Thomas was the most conservative, with a score of 3.637; Justice John Paul Stevens, at -2.516, was the most liberal. O'Connor's score, 0.247, just a hair to the right of center, represented the court's midpoint. O'Connor's score has gone down steadily, or become more liberal, since 1994. In that year, she was at 0.637.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study also argues that, but for O'Connor's evolution, the court would not have approved of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, which it did in 2003, by a 5 to 4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to their calculations, the political scientists say, \"the likelihood of O'Connor providing the key vote to uphold the program was quite small for any term prior to 2001.\"</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 46s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/421600586.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Valley Perspective; Race and Politics Make for Complicated Loyalties, Choices</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It isn't easy being a black Republican.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice and Colorado Lt. Gov. Joe Rogers are trotted out like trophies, an attractive serving of political correctness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up in a black Republican family. My father was a delegate from Kansas to the 1964 GOP convention. On our way to the convention in San Francisco, we were run off the road in Arizona by a car with John Birch Society bumper stickers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was only 14, but I couldn't understand my father's party loyalty. Yet when I watched him walk to the podium at the Cow Palace and give then-Pennsylvania Gov. William Scranton's seconding speech, I experienced the contradiction. I felt proud even though I knew that the Republicans had soundly defeated a proposal to strengthen the civil rights plank with pledges for speedy school desegregation, full voting rights and elimination of job bias.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Was my father flawed?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the years, I have observed that most African Americans in the Republican Party care less about identity politics than their counterparts in the Democratic Party. My father's mantra was the business of self-reliance, doing for yourself rather than waiting for the government. And his lectures to me were on how blacks must be active in both political parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in 2000, the reasons some blacks join the Republican Party are more complicated. Thirty years ago, my father, along with other civil rights activists such as then-Assistant Secretary of Labor Art Fletcher, were building a legacy. They demonstrated a commitment to the black community. Fletcher's Philadelphia Plan under Richard Nixon's presidency increased the opportunities for minorities and women to compete in the job market. The Philadelphia Plan made federal contractors meet specific goals in hiring women and minorities, the forerunner of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now, many black Republicans just enjoy unsettling people. Sound bites and big hats. Others like Rogers state that they have chosen to take the \"road less traveled.\" And as I listened to him in a debate with Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) at the recent National Assn. of Black Journalists convention, I recognized the advantages of not going where the competition is fierce. For the truly politically ambitious, there appears to be an impressive list of Democratic wannabes. Why queue up behind a long line of well- established power brokers?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At that same time, however, I saw someone who was brave enough to stand up to a polite but solid wall of contempt from the black audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was never that brave. Although I was a black Republican until my father died in 1983, I only took advantage of his sweat equity. I inserted myself into the 1976 GOP convention in Kansas City and worked in the press office handling media relations for the black delegates and party leaders. In the early 1980s, because of my father and good political contacts, I was offered a public affairs position in Washington, D.C.. I was seduced by the image of power, politics and press initially, but after two weeks of trying out D.C. with interviews, meetings and receptions, I declined the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was changing and developing different political values. I observed that the era of black Republicans like my father had passed. And what I saw in its place was no longer for me. I left the party to become a Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those early days, I had considered myself a pragmatist by being Republican. Although my friends labeled me an opportunist, I rationalized that everything was a boost for my career. My commitment, however, was only to my father. Never did I reflect his loyalty to the Republican Party. Neither do the black Republicans I see today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My father had a faith in his party and its potential. He wanted to make a contribution for black people, to stand up and be counted even when it was dangerous. It was his personal honesty. It was his fine flaw.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sharon Woodson-Bryant is a Burbank freelance writer</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 37s "}}
