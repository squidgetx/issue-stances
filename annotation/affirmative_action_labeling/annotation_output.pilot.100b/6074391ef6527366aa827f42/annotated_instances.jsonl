It's an experiment providing a \"universal basic income,\" or UBI, to low-income Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In conjunction with the Marin Community Foundation, which plans to contribute $3 million to the effort, the Marin County Board of Supervisors has allocated $400,000 in public funds for the experiment. The program is similar to one recently completed in Stockton, Calif., but one major difference sets the Marin experiment apart: race and sex discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Stockton UBI experiment provided payments to 125 residents of neighborhoods at or below Stockton's median household income. The Marin regime will do the same, but beneficiaries must be \"mothers of color.\" That term is undefined, but it's clear that fathers and white mothers are ineligible to participate. A similar race-based scheme has been announced in Oakland, Calif.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter what one thinks of UBI as a policy matter, the use of public funds in the Marin scheme is legally dubious. The California Constitution's equal-protection clause, like the federal one in the 14th Amendment, applies \"strict scrutiny\"\u2014the highest possible level of judicial scrutiny\u2014to racial classifications. California courts, unlike federal ones, also apply strict scrutiny to sex classifications. In Connerly v. State Personnel Board (2001), a California appeals court made that clear in invalidating both race- and sex-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If I had grown up in Marin County under its proposed UBI regime, my family would have been ineligible to participate. I grew up poor and at times homeless or living in public housing projects. But my mother, who is white, was raising her three black children on her own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin Community Foundation's chief executive, Thomas Peters, has said that \"this first cohort will focus on low-income moms of color\" because they face \"the greatest aggregate of challenges: low income, young children and facing the daily travails and insults of overt and covert racial discrimination.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My mother was low-income, had three young children and faced racial discrimination. We lived in black communities where black men were stigmatized for consorting with white women, and that stigma flowed to those women and their biracial children.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If my mother was somehow privileged over similarly situated black mothers, it could only have been by the slimmest possible margin. To exclude someone like her from a public-assistance program on account of her skin color is the very definition of racial injustice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin UBI scheme threatens to drive the wedge of racial discord currently tearing wildly through our social fabric even deeper. And frankly, policies with good intentions such as UBI, which might conceivably help to address the intractable problem of poverty, will be tainted with the scarlet R of racism and the understandable suspicion of being a pretense for reparative racial justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Westhill is president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marin County's Discriminatory 'Universal Basic Income'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Devon Westhill</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}

In that opinion, she wrote that the court \u201cexpects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.\u201d Driver argues that the years remaining on the clock that started with Grutter could offer public and private institutions of higher learning a way to adapt to race-neutral admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In another essay last week, Linda Greenhouse, who reported on the Supreme Court for The Times from 1978 to 2008, casts the upcoming oral arguments as evidence that the meaning of Brown v.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2053215813.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Diversity at what cost?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is amazing to me that President Trump has not, on a rare day when he's in New York, exited Trump Tower, made a sharp left, and limousined down to Stuyvesant High School. It is New York City's crown jewel, where - like in the fictional Lake Wobegon - all the students really are \"above average.\" And just to make matters more intriguing and complicated, Stuyvesant's student body is majority Asian American</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>. The mayor thinks this is a \"monumental injustice\" and that more of the students should be Hispanic and black. For that, he recently asked congregants at a black church for an \"amen.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, from certain critics, he got a groan of opposition and disbelief. In the name of racial equity, fairness and that most deceptive of all words, diversity, he would demolish a system that at Stuyvesant and seven other elite city high schools has, without a doubt, propelled countless poor kids right into the middle class - and beyond.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason I mentioned Trump in the first paragraph is that his base consists, in no small part, of white males who think the deck is stacked against them; that the liberal policies of the Obama years, personified by Hillary Clinton, unfairly favored other groups or, when it came to trade, other nations. You and I may quibble with this view, but then along comes Mayor Bill de Blasio to demand an \"amen\" to his efforts to tilt a color-blind admissions system to get a different blend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Blacks and Hispanics comprise 67 percent</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>of New York's public school students. Yet Stuyvesant's incoming freshman class contains only 10 black students, 27 Hispanics, 151 whites - and 613 Asian Americans. A similar imbalance applies to the city's seven other elite schools, including Brooklyn Tech, where the mayor's son just graduated. Clearly, something is off. In the best of all possible worlds, these schools should have student bodies that reflect the city's demographics. This, though, is not the best of all worlds. It's the one we have.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And in this world, the children of Asian immigrants walk away with the lion's share of admissions. Why? Simple. They study. They study hard. Admissions to New York's academically elite schools is based solely on an entrance exam. That's it. No alumni recommendations. No offer of a contribution. No athletic ability or anything of the sort. Take the test. Score high. Get in. Nothing could be fairer. Yet, de Blasio, a Democrat, wants to do away with the exam all together.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an exhaustive piece for the City Journal about Brooklyn's Chinese American community - one of New York's several Chinatowns - Kay S. Hymowitz writes that \"If, as sometimes appears the case, 'Harvard' is the first English word that immigrant Chinese mothers learn, the second is probably 'Stuyvesant.' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reading Hymowitz's description of how these parents work around the clock for their children - rising before dawn to ensure that homework is done - is exhausting in itself. Often, they put aside money to have their kids prepped for the Stuyvesant admissions test. This is not a perk of the rich. This is yet another sacrifice these parents make for their children.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My limited tolerance for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> - possibly permissible when the poor are advantaged at the expense of the rich - hits a wall in this case. By and large, the Asian Americans of Stuyvesant are not rich. Many of them are poor, so-called Title I kids, entitled to all sorts of aid. They and their parents played by the rules and studied hard. Why should they be deprived - on the basis of race or ethnicity - of what they earned? That's what the mayor wants to happen. Asian American kids have to make way for black or Hispanic ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The figures are both stark and tragic. But they prove, to the obstinate blindness of the doctrinaire, that poverty is not always the determinant. You can hardly get poorer than many of the Asian immigrants. They come to America with little. Many can't even speak English. In her article, Hymowitz says Chinese families often \"maintain that they have been discriminated against, and they tell their children to expect discrimination as well.\" It's a hard, hard life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already, the mayor has reserved some slots for students whoalmostpass the exam so that more black and Hispanic kids will be admitted to the special schools. For him, it is only a beginning. In the name of diversity, he wants to scrap the test and, thereby, destroy a system that epitomized the American dream and - as Trump might say - made America great.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>cohenr@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Richard Cohen</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 20s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/420033919.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Incendiary hate</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Being a Chicagoan whose ethnicity has been slurred repeatedly over Chicago Fire Department radio frequencies is bad enough. Being a Chicagoan whose tax dollars helped purchase the microphones, transmitters and speakers via which these hateful, hurtful words have been broadcast, being a Chicagoan whose taxes evidently pay the wages of bigots, that's injury added to the insult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once again, Chicago has been rocked by charges that some of its firefighters aren't comfortable serving many of the people who live here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The five racist radio transmissions of recent weeks have generated more shock than surprise. The transmissions didn't occur in a void. They follow more than three decades of tension within the department since its ranks were belatedly integrated in 1968.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of that tension over the years has stayed within the city's firehouses. On rare occasion, citizens have been able to peer inside, or to listen from afar. What they've seen and heard isn't always ennobling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1997, a videotape surfaced depicting a 1990 firehouse retirement party at which firefighters were drinking, exposing themselves and uttering racial slurs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the firefighters who attended the party, James McNally, now is president of Chicago Fire Fighters Union Local 2. On another occasion, he appeared in black face to protest promotions motivated by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not to say most Chicago firefighters condone racism. But firefighters--provocateurs and innocents alike--do need to appreciate how grave these five radio incidents are, as is the delivery of a death threat to a battalion chief who heads the African American Fire Fighters League of Chicago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are times, particularly when the offenders are young or ignorant, when ugly behavior can be forgiven if not forgotten, when its perpetrators can be redeemed if not encouraged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not one of those times. This behavior, in this department, in this city, is intolerable. There is no wellspring of goodwill upon which an offending firefighter can call, no margin for middling penance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Simply put, these disgusting, dehumanizing incidents follow too much history. Fire Commissioner James Joyce declared last week that \"offenses like these will be fireable offenses.\" Translation: Joyce has committed himself to judging each case individually, but he has put every one of his employees on notice that the range of penalties unquestionably includes dismissal. Mayor Richard Daley concurred, stating that a still unidentified person--thought to be a firefighter--who voiced racial slurs broadcast March 1 should admit his action and face the \"ultimate consequences.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is the correct response. When these kinds of calculated affronts to city and department policy occur, when reasonable citizens are left to wonder about the integrity of the firefighters they employ, jobs should--must--be on the line.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But whether Joyce can fulfill his own prophecy is another matter. The department terminated seven firefighters who appeared in the 1990 videotape. They challenged the dismissals before an arbitrator and eventually won back their jobs--with pension and seniority rights, the department says, although without four years of back pay.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Merely identifying whoever has been spewing filth on fire department frequencies isn't easy. One veteran firefighter who voiced racist slander, and a supervisor who didn't react properly, have been suspended over the first of the five incidents. It's likely the subsequent transmissions originated on fire department radios, but in this era of clever hackers and electronic gadgetry, the department isn't yet certain that no outsider is involved. Joyce, though, hasn't sounded like a boss who expects to learn that his own employees are innocent. Last week he denounced an \"underground Web site\" that offered firefighters tips on how to obscure their identities when transmitting over department frequencies. \"That's what we're up against,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's also up against an unmeasured amount of denial over society's gradual progress on race. Many of today's Chicago firefighters did come of age in a department culture that to varying degrees rewarded three attributes: skill, courage and clout. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span>, though, is about a fourth, and to some foreign, attribute: fairness. It's understandable, if not admirable, that adding fairness to the mix caused resentment among those who feel that the long-overdue accelerated promotion of minorities--a cause Joyce has advanced--is unfair to some whites who don't get those promotions. What's not understandable is for any Chicago firefighter to permit that or any other frustration to be voiced in the most vicious bigotry imaginable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Firefighters who don't share that bigotry are now in the best position to lead the department out of its difficult past. One important step is to help nail the perpetrators of the radio incidents. Public racism tends to be a team sport. It's likely someone inside or outside the department knows who originated these broadcasts. Stepping forward with that knowledge may require even more courage than racing into a burning house.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But restoring the department's integrity, like rescuing fire victims, is a critical public service. And that cause, public service, should be key to how this sorry drama concludes. Any firefighter who merely wants to fight fire is free to resign and join the U.S. Forest Service. Any firefighter who wants to serve the public--in all its varied hues, in its wide range of good and bad behaviors, in its terrible moments when disaster strikes and panic ensues--is welcome to stay.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, if a firefighter finds himself risking his own life to save the lives of Chicagoans he finds unworthy of his respect, he should find another job. Fire Commissioner Joyce is right to pursue those few who've let that lack of respect get the best of them. The hope here is that he will root them out, adjudicate their cases under the due process to which they're entitled--and subject them to the ultimate consequences Mayor Daley properly threatened last week.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}

In a survey of 980 people stopped on the street in 10 cities, the Pere Partnership advertising agency asked respondents how their votes were swayed by the political activism of Charlton Heston, Michael Moore and Bruce Springsteen. What was the most common response?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) It swayed me to vote for the celebrity's candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) It swayed me to vote for the other candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>9. In the same survey, respondents were asked to name the celebrity whose endorsement was least likely to make them vote for a presidential candidate. Here are the four names mentioned the most often. Place them in order, starting with the celebrity least likely to sway anyone's vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Martha Stewart.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) O.J.

What new strategy is the Kerry campaign planning for Ohio on Tuesday?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Carrying voters to the polls in sedan chairs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Posting security guards along Lake Erie to prevent Mr. Kerry from windsurfing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Promising toasters to the first 10 voters at each polling place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Employing a ''snack czar'' to hand out food to voters in line.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Assigning each voter a ''personal lawyer.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>14. According to The Associated Press, a Democratic politician campaigning for Mr. Kerry in Florida declared, ''If we were living in another country and we had the president of the country and his brother controlling one of the biggest provinces or states, we would ... have some doubts about whether, given their track record, they really believe in democracy.'' Who said it?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) A former vice president and senator whose father was a senator.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) A senator of a populous state whose brothers served simultaneously as president and attorney general.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) A congressman who is the son of the senator whose brothers served as president and attorney general.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) A former cabinet official whose father was governor of one of the biggest states and who married the niece of the senator whose brothers served as president and attorney general.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) A senator elected in one of the biggest states while her husband was president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>15.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/399070959.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- de gustibus: What Obama Can't Change: The Lives of Blacks</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Barack Obama wins the keys to the White House next month, even nonsupporters will acknowledge the historic significance of his achievement. And America's. But what might an Obama victory mean for African-Americans in particular? Should we expect his administration to play a major role in black group advancement?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than a century, black civic leaders have tangled over whether to pursue economic independence or focus their energies on integrating political, corporate and educational institutions. W.E.B. Du Bois, author of the groundbreaking 1903 treatise, \"The Souls of Black Folk,\" argued for the latter, while his contemporary, Booker T. Washington, said \"political activity alone\" was not the answer. In addition, insisted Washington, \"you must have property, industry, skill, economy, intelligence and character.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the 1960s, the black civil-rights leadership has sided with Du Bois. Between 1970 and 2001, the number of black elected officials in the U.S. grew from fewer than 1,500 to more than 9,000. And while impressive socioeconomic progress has been made, wide black-white gaps remain in educational achievement, homeownership rates, labor-force participation, income levels and other measures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor should we conclude that civil-rights laws are responsible for the black progress that has occurred. For example, up until the 1950s, and in an era of open and rampant racial discrimination, the jobless rate for blacks was much lower than today and similar to that of whites in the same age group. In fact, blacks had higher labor-force participation rates than whites in every Census taken between 1890 and 1950. And in the decades preceding the 1960s -- that is, prior to the passage of landmark civil-rights bills and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> legislation -- there were sharp rises in black educational achievement, both absolutely and relative to whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economist Thomas Sowell has spent decades researching racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. and abroad. And his findings -- in books like \"Race and Culture: A World View,\" \"Affirmative Action Around the World\" and \"Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?\" -- show that political activity generally has not been a factor in the rise of groups from poverty to prosperity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Germans came to the U.S. as indentured servants during colonial times. And while working to pay off the cost of the voyage they studiously avoided participation in politics. Only after they'd risen economically did Germans begin seeking public office, culminating with the election of presidents Hoover and Eisenhower.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern can be found among Chinese populations in southeast Asia, the Caribbean and the U.S. In Argentina, where English minorities have done well financially and played a major role in the development of the economy, they've played almost no role in Argentine politics. And so it goes with Italians in the the U.S. and Jews in Britain: In both places economic gains have generally preceded political gains. \"Empirically, political activity and political success have been neither necessary nor sufficient for economic advancement,\" writes Mr. Sowell. \"Nor has eager political participation or outstanding success in politics translated into faster group achievement.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans might keep in mind that in those rare instances where the political success of a minority group has come first, it has often resulted in slower socioeconomic progress. The Irish immigrants who came to the U.S. in the mid-19th century hailed from a country where 80% of the population was rural. Yet they settled in industrial centers like New York, Philadelphia and Boston and took low-skill jobs. Their rise from poverty was especially slow -- as late as 1920, 80% of all Irish women working in America were domestic servants -- despite the fact that Irish-run political organizations dominated many big-city governments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Irish were fiercely loyal to each other, electing, appointing and promoting their own kind,\" writes Mr. Sowell. \"This had little effect on the average Irish American, who began to reach economic prosperity in the 20th century at about the same time when the Irish political machines began to decline.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If elected, Mr. Obama may well turn out to be a competent president, even an admirable one. But history gives us no indication that his political success will translate into black upward mobility. And given Mr. Obama's liberal leanings, there's every reason to believe that current obstacles to black progress will remain in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The candidate favors minimum-wage laws, for example, on the assumption that they help lift people out of poverty. But most poor people already earn more than the minimum wage. And most people who earn the minimum wage aren't poor. Minimum-wage laws are more likely to price people out of the labor market, especially younger and less educated workers, a large number of whom happen to be black. Today's economy places a premium on skills. If young people can't get an entry-level job because an artificial federal wage floor has made them too expensive to hire, they can't gain the skills and experience to move up the economic ladder.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take another example: Mr. Obama opposes educational choice, which will also have a negative impact on poor blacks, who tend to be the ones stuck in America's worst public schools. Mr. Obama opposes school vouchers that would allow low-income black parents to send their children to the type of private school where he sends his own daughters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both cases, the only \"change\" that Mr. Obama would be bringing the Oval Office is the color of the person perpetrating bad policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Riley is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 27s "}}

Pete Wilson turns 85 tomorrow, so on behalf of all Californians, I say: gracias. (That's \"thank you\" in Spanish, Pedro.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for your 30-plus years of service as a public official -- first, as an assemblyman for San Diego, then as the mayor of that city, followed by two terms apiece as our U.S. senator and governor. Your career helped shaped the modern-day Golden State.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a career mostly defined by a moderate approach -- an important lesson for the Democrats and Republicans of today that too few bother to remember.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for a mayoral career that saw you protect San Diego's wetlands and implement <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> hiring practices. \"He believes that America's minorities have been handicapped for years,\" one campaign flier read, \"by inadequate housing, education and job opportunities, and he has dedicated his efforts to alleviating these problems.\" That's a reality that more Republicans should acknowledge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for being so hurt when the Republican Party pulled their 1972 convention from San Diego that you responded with an \"America's Finest City\" campaign. You showed second-tier cities across the country that they too should be proud of who they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for proving that Republicans can take the lead in addressing America's prior racial wrongs. As senator, you cosponsored the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which granted reparations and an official government apology to Japanese Americans interned during World War II.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for showing us that a Republican governor could understand that raising taxes to help shore up public finances was a wise thing and not treason. In 1991, when California faced a record deficit, you backed tax increases for sales, the wealthy and even snacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias too for throwing away this record of centrism. (Just bear with me.) You showed future generations of politicians how not to ruin their legacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for helping to deregulate California's electricity, which led to mass blackouts in the beginning of the 2000s and convinced an entire generation that we shouldn't leave public utilities to the private market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for signing the state's three-strikes sentencing laws. The increase in prisoners proved that justice isn't blind but usually racist and always classist, and it planted the first seeds of distrust in law enforcement that have bloomed into a movement across the state today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for working so hard to eliminate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> at the University of California and beyond. The program helped to get thousands of minorities into the middle class, where they promptly retreated into the comforts of whiteness. Your 180-degree turn on the issue radicalized college students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, most of all, for Proposition 187. You didn't author the 1994 measure, which declared war on immigrants in the country illegally and the people who helped them. But you jumped on the 187 bandwagon and took the reins as soon as you could to help resurrect your flagging reelection campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, Mexican Americans like me realized for the first time that a large part of society still considered us \"Mexican\" and not \"American,\" like we always believed ourselves to be. Most of us have identified with the former more than the latter ever since.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, MEChA bounced back. The Chicano high school and college group was slowly losing its power as more Mexican Americans began to identify as \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\" and wanted no part with radical politics. Because of 187, MEChA members went on to reinvigorate the labor movement, introduce ethnic studies in high schools, and make Dia de los Muertos a thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring Latinos to enter politics like never before. And gracias for making the defense of immigrants their rallying cry. From state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra's zeal, to bringing back driver's licenses for the undocumented (which you took away), to declaring us a sanctuary state, it's all a direct response to your cynicism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring two of the most hilarious death-metal songs ever: \"Matando Gueros\" (\"Killing White People\") and \"Raza Odiada\" (\"Hated Race\"), both by Brujeria. I certainly hope that you take their mock-assassination skit as satire at its finest, instead of a bona fide threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for providing the California Republican Party a cautionary tale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inadvertently posing for an airplane selfie two years ago with film director Alex Rivera. Your befuddled expression reminded Latinos that you're not a monster but rather just a confused fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And gracias for still not getting it. At a recent speech by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon to the Southern California Leadership Council, you complained to him that Sacramento \"ignores us,\" whatever the hell that means. (Who's \"us\"?) Speaker Rendon's grace in responding to your petulance -- basically \"I'm here now\" -- was as great an example of Old and New California as Rivera could've scripted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, Governor Pedro.

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 49s "}}

The buffer-zone law prohibited protesting within 35 feet of the entrance to abortion clinics \u2014 it was \u201cdeemed by the court to be overly broad, restricting the free speech of the plaintiffs, who sought to dissuade women from having abortions by quietly handing them literature and urging them to consider alternatives.\u201d This new law would permit law-enforcement officers to order protesters to withdraw from an abbreviated buffer zone \u201cif they impede access to the clinic.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFor the past five months, the world\u2019s most important unelected official has been a 67-year-old former economics professor, who\u2019s apparently still pre-gentrified Brooklyn enough to pronounce guide \u2018goyd,\u2019\u201d\u00a0says an editorial in The Guardian.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/422176235.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Who's the hypocrite?; It's not fair to use affirmative action against Clarence Thomas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the release of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' memoir, \"My Grandfather's Son,\" all of the old smears directed against him since his confirmation hearings 16 years ago are once again being trotted out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That he's \"incompetent.\" That he's \"not qualified.\" That the only reason he was appointed is because he's black. In other words, that he's a product of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> or, more precisely, an \"<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, for instance, liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote: \"I believe in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, but I have to acknowledge there are arguments against it. One of the more cogent is the presence of Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Robinson's comment echoes many previous attacks. In 2000, for example, Newsweek columnist Anna Quindlen -- another liberal who has written in support of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> -- declared that Thomas' \"judicial resume was mediocre; he was chosen because he was conservative and black, an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire by an administration that eschewed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many liberal Democrats aren't willing to say out loud what Robinson and Quindlen wrote so clearly. After all, they're conditioned to defend racial preferences, which they insist do not promote \"incompetent\" or \"unqualified\" people. But that doesn't mean they don't think it. Even The American Prospect magazine, a liberal journal that sees its mission as \"beating back the right wing,\" ran an article two years ago calling Thomas the \"most visible <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land, a token black nominee whose lack of qualifications was so painfully outed during his confirmation hearings.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How can you support a policy of racial preferences and then attack one of its supposed beneficiaries as undeserving? This, ultimately, is the intrinsic hypocrisy of the Thomas bashers. They allege that he's not competent and that the only reason he became a Supreme Court justice was because he's black. And in so doing, they level the exact same arguments against Thomas that they castigate conservatives for making about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> itself. But let's face facts: A program that gives people with a certain skin color an advantage will invariably reward some who would otherwise not qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This blatant intellectual inconsistency does not stop Thomas' liberal critics from accusing him of hypocrisy -- namely, for being the \"most visible <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land\" while simultaneously standing as its most prominent black opponent. By opposing racial preferences, liberals say, Thomas -- who was accepted into Yale Law School via an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program -- is denying others the very same benefits he received.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Thomas reveals in \"My Grandfather's Son,\" his opposition to racial preferences is based on personal conscience and a genuine concern for its effects on black Americans, not selfish disregard for his racial brethren born out of self-loathing, as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> advocates would have it. He writes that he keeps his Yale diploma tucked away in his basement with a 15-cent cigar sticker affixed to its frame. Why? In a \"60 Minutes\" interview, Thomas said \"that degree meant one thing for whites and another thing for blacks. . . . It was discounted.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is one of the tragic legacies of racial preferences -- that the achievements of black people in the professional world will always be suspect, and not just to blacks who benefit from such preferences. In the minds even of liberals, blacks will always be thought of as \"<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hires\" no matter how bright or qualified they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may be difficult for well-intentioned white liberals to understand the personal insecurity that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> causes, and as a white person, I can only take someone like Thomas at his word when he writes about the shame he feels because of racial preferences. But as a gay man, I can certainly empathize, as I imagine I would feel exactly the same way if sexual orientation became a \"plus factor\" in a law school or employment application process. Factoring in a person's immutable traits demeans them and robs them of their individuality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether or not Thomas is qualified to be a Supreme Court justice, who are <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> advocates to smear him as an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire? (Can you imagine a left-wing magazine like The American Prospect saying that about a liberal black judge? It would never happen.) But if they honestly believe Thomas is one, then they only have themselves to blame for a rotten system that privileges some people over others because of skin pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the day his Supreme Court nomination was announced by President George H.W. Bush, Thomas' critics have personally and viciously attacked him as if he were an abstraction -- representing everything they hate about minorities (whether women, gays or blacks) who do not subscribe to their liberal nostrums -- and, in so doing, have sucked him of his humanity as an individual. If liberals want to live up to their self-purported principles of equality and free inquiry, they would do well to stop treating Clarence Thomas as the scapegoat for their political agendas and start treating him like a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:David Suter For The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James Kirchick is on the editorial staff of The New Republic.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 1s "}}
