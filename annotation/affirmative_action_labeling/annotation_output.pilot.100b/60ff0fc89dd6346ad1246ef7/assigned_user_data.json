(As to why the U.S. would negotiate with a foreign country over a state in the union, just suspend your disbelief.) Charitably, the HRA offers to refrains from blowing up bars or assassinating presidents. At last they hammer out a deal, to international celebration. No more carnage!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not the end of the story, because \"peace\" doesn't come cheap. Texas is still a star in Old Glory, but the American flag is put out of view in public places lest it alienate Hispanics.

The Texas state police force, which did so much to keep the HRA from killing even more people than it did, is drastically downsized and renamed.

No, the president of the U.S. grovels. With no promises from the HRA on disarmament (its representatives have proposed how they might theoretically disarm, but not when), he promises to withdraw the National Guard from Texas and to dismantle its outposts. He announces an amnesty for HRA men on the lam, giving about 60 desperadoes a clean record. He promises the secessionist leadership that convicted felons can infiltrate the Texas police force, and serve on its supervisory board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this happens even though a new dissident group is bombing D.C. again. (The \"Real\" HRA comprises disaffected HRA members who still think -- and you can see why, with such an accommodating federal government -- that they can win Texas by force.)

And he must do so on a night less than three weeks before Election Day in a year when the debates thus far have failed to draw audiences anywhere near as large as those of '92.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How did Mr. Dole paint himself into this corner? Conventional wisdom blames the press for intimidating him into silence until now by threatening to shout ''Hatchet man!'' the moment he ''goes negative.'' But raising serious questions about Clinton Administration ethics, phrased precisely and respectfully, is not the same as railing about ''Democrat wars'' or crying ''Liberal!'' or invoking Paula Jones. The obvious questions Mr. Dole might ask tonight -- whether about the rifling of F.B.I. files, potential pardons for the McDougals or an influence-seeking Indonesian campaign contributor -- have been aired daily by the press itself.

Mr. Dole's habit of equivocating and reversing himself has been a damaging pattern of his candidacy from the start on a variety of fronts, not just on the matter of challenging White House ethics. He's visibly wavered so often that his leadership capabilities are as much in doubt as who hired Craig Livingstone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the primaries, Mr. Dole waffled about how to go after Pat Buchanan's extremist views much as he has waffled about challenging Mr. Clinton, refusing even to criticize Mr. Buchanan for his anti-Semitic rhetoric. When Mr. Dole's campaign officials made the embarrassing gaffe of returning a $1,000 contribution from the gay Log Cabin Republicans, the candidate dawdled for months before finally chastising his own errant staff. On abortion, he has quickly retreated under fire on nearly every stand he has taken this year, including his ''not negotiable'' call for a tolerance plank in the G.O.P. platform. Most self-destructively of all, Mr. Dole abruptly reversed his career-long stands in favor of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and against supply-side economics to prove himself, as he put it, ''another Ronald Reagan, if that's what you want.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This recent history helps explain why so many Americans don't regard Mr. Dole as a leader, but as a split-the-difference Beltway legislative mechanic. If he can't stand up to fellow Republicans, not to mention his Democratic opponent, how will he stand up to a Saddam Hussein? If he can't command his own campaign, how can he run the country?

His equivocations, reversals and avoidance of confrontations fuel the polls in which voters doubt he is tough enough to push through a 15 percent tax cut and balance the budget at the same time. Dole admirers, by contrast, point out how appealing it is to find a politician who honestly expresses his ambivalence in public rather than sticking to a phony, robotic script. That's true enough.

AI needs nothing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can't at this point see exactly how AI might evolve. We know instinctively that the good often is shadowed by the bad.

So it is hardly surprising that only 23 percent of high-achieving low-income students even apply to a selective school, compared with more than twice as many - 48 percent - high-achieving students from families with higher incomes.

And America's. But what might an Obama victory mean for African-Americans in particular? Should we expect his administration to play a major role in black group advancement?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than a century, black civic leaders have tangled over whether to pursue economic independence or focus their energies on integrating political, corporate and educational institutions. W.E.B. Du Bois, author of the groundbreaking 1903 treatise, \"The Souls of Black Folk,\" argued for the latter, while his contemporary, Booker T. Washington, said \"political activity alone\" was not the answer. In addition, insisted Washington, \"you must have property, industry, skill, economy, intelligence and character.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the 1960s, the black civil-rights leadership has sided with Du Bois. Between 1970 and 2001, the number of black elected officials in the U.S. grew from fewer than 1,500 to more than 9,000. And while impressive socioeconomic progress has been made, wide black-white gaps remain in educational achievement, homeownership rates, labor-force participation, income levels and other measures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor should we conclude that civil-rights laws are responsible for the black progress that has occurred. For example, up until the 1950s, and in an era of open and rampant racial discrimination, the jobless rate for blacks was much lower than today and similar to that of whites in the same age group. In fact, blacks had higher labor-force participation rates than whites in every Census taken between 1890 and 1950. And in the decades preceding the 1960s -- that is, prior to the passage of landmark civil-rights bills and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> legislation -- there were sharp rises in black educational achievement, both absolutely and relative to whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economist Thomas Sowell has spent decades researching racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. and abroad. And his findings -- in books like \"Race and Culture: A World View,\" \"Affirmative Action Around the World\" and \"Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?\" -- show that political activity generally has not been a factor in the rise of groups from poverty to prosperity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Germans came to the U.S. as indentured servants during colonial times.

And so it goes with Italians in the the U.S. and Jews in Britain: In both places economic gains have generally preceded political gains. \"Empirically, political activity and political success have been neither necessary nor sufficient for economic advancement,\" writes Mr. Sowell. \"Nor has eager political participation or outstanding success in politics translated into faster group achievement.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans might keep in mind that in those rare instances where the political success of a minority group has come first, it has often resulted in slower socioeconomic progress.

But most poor people already earn more than the minimum wage. And most people who earn the minimum wage aren't poor. Minimum-wage laws are more likely to price people out of the labor market, especially younger and less educated workers, a large number of whom happen to be black. Today's economy places a premium on skills.

Should we expect his administration to play a major role in black group advancement?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than a century, black civic leaders have tangled over whether to pursue economic independence or focus their energies on integrating political, corporate and educational institutions. W.E.B. Du Bois, author of the groundbreaking 1903 treatise, \"The Souls of Black Folk,\" argued for the latter, while his contemporary, Booker T. Washington, said \"political activity alone\" was not the answer. In addition, insisted Washington, \"you must have property, industry, skill, economy, intelligence and character.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the 1960s, the black civil-rights leadership has sided with Du Bois. Between 1970 and 2001, the number of black elected officials in the U.S. grew from fewer than 1,500 to more than 9,000. And while impressive socioeconomic progress has been made, wide black-white gaps remain in educational achievement, homeownership rates, labor-force participation, income levels and other measures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor should we conclude that civil-rights laws are responsible for the black progress that has occurred. For example, up until the 1950s, and in an era of open and rampant racial discrimination, the jobless rate for blacks was much lower than today and similar to that of whites in the same age group. In fact, blacks had higher labor-force participation rates than whites in every Census taken between 1890 and 1950. And in the decades preceding the 1960s -- that is, prior to the passage of landmark civil-rights bills and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> legislation -- there were sharp rises in black educational achievement, both absolutely and relative to whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economist Thomas Sowell has spent decades researching racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. and abroad. And his findings -- in books like \"Race and Culture: A World View,\" \"Affirmative Action Around the World\" and \"Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?\" -- show that political activity generally has not been a factor in the rise of groups from poverty to prosperity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Germans came to the U.S. as indentured servants during colonial times.

But Scalia's version of originalism led to him dissent stridently from rulings recognizing rights, such as abortion or marriage equality for gays and lesbians, that his colleagues rightly read into more general language in the Constitution about \"liberty\" and \"equal protection of the laws.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those decisions were a natural outgrowth of earlier rulings in which the court secured other rights that the Constitution didn't explicitly guarantee, such as a right to marry someone of another race (or the right to marry at all) or the right to use contraceptives in the privacy of one's bedroom. An America in which those decisions had come out the other way would not be an America in which most of us would want to live.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators should ask Gorsuch whether he shares Scalia's disdain for the court's decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage and, if so, whether he would nevertheless accord those decisions respect as precedents of the court.
