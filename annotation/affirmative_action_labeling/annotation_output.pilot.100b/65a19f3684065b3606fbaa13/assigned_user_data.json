As ties grow, the United States increasingly is trying to shape other countries' societies. Trade talks used to focus on tariffs, duties, anti-dumping provisions and other matters that only trade lawyers understood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. officials focus on what they call \"non-tariff barriers\": corruption, inadequate antitrust law, even zoning-like regulations that may work against U.S. products. In Europe, the United States is fighting health laws that keep out U.S. beef. In Japan, the United States attacks laws that help preserve neighborhoods by shielding small shops from competition -- but also make life difficult for U.S. exporters. U.S. labor unions want the administration to pressure other nations to allow collective bargaining.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, other nations don't always welcome these initiatives. Even less surprisingly, they have their own ideas about how the United States should organize itself. To win the right to challenge foreign barriers before international judges, America has had to subject itself to the same rules. Baker says he modeled his anti-Nigeria law on state laws that helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But in the intervening years, the United States has signed on to treaties that preclude such laws -- and that give other nations the right to demand compensation from Washington if their firms are barred in Maryland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no question, the State Department's Larson says, that the stuff of international negotiation today tends tend to \"get into your living room\" more than in the past. He should know; he's point man for a treaty-in-progress known as the Multilateral Agreement on Investments.

But it's the object of fevered opposition on talk radio and in some corners of the Internet.

But opponents are more persuasive when they list decisions they say could be taken out of Americans' hands. Since MAI would forbid countries from demanding a certain level of investment, wouldn't the Community Reinvestment Act -- which says banks must invest in low-income neighborhoods -- be thrown out? Since the treaty bans anything \"tantamount\" to expropriation, couldn't a foreign tobacco company challenge advertising restrictions that reduce the value of its investment?

Joseph Lieberman as running mate, and tapped Mrs. Townsend instead, it's quite possible she'd be vice president today, stumping for Democratic candidates along with President Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lieberman's peak as a candidate in 2000 occurred on the very day he was chosen by Mr. Gore, with the expected mainstream media exultation at the \"daring\" selection of a Jewish man given the nod. Not only was the Connecticut senator overmatched by Dick Cheney in their one debate, but his hollow threats of censoring the entertainment industry, while accepting massive donations from Hollywood moguls, exposed him as a hypocrite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend was excluded from Mr. Gore's \"short list\" because of her inexperience -- one-and-a-half terms as Maryland's lieutenant governor and a failed congressional race in 1986 -- and presumably because her state is one of the most reliably Democratic in the nation. However, there's little doubt that her candidacy would not have cost Mr. Gore a single state he eventually won against President Bush. In fact, given her pedigree as Robert F. Kennedy's eldest child, with an extended family campaigning for the ticket, it's likely the team would've won New Hampshire, West Virginia and Florida, and thus the election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Mrs. Townsend, never a nimble candidate on her own, is struggling to fend off Republican Rep. Robert Ehrlich in this year's battle to succeed the unpopular Parris Glendening as Maryland's governor. The contest has been mired in a statistical dead heat since mid-summer -- a Mason-Dixon Maryland poll last weekend showed Mrs. Townsend leading Mr. Ehrlich by a 46% to 45% margin -- as Mrs. Townsend has failed to lock up the state's large black electorate, a base of voters that's typically a given for a Democratic candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend's political pitch has been less than perfect. In June she angered Baltimore City's black leaders by choosing retired Navy Admiral Charles Larson, a white former Republican, as her running mate. Mr. Ehrlich, meanwhile, a four-term congressman from Baltimore County, chose a black man, Michael Steele.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fairness, the current political environment, influenced as it's been by corporate scandals and a backlash against wealthy businessmen, doesn't make the most hospitable turf for a candidate born to privilege. In contrast to Mrs. Townsend, Mr. Ehrlich was reared in the blue-collar Baltimore suburb of Arbutus, where he earned an academic/sports scholarship to Princeton. He then returned to Maryland, spending eight years in the state's House of Delegates before being elected to Congress in 1994.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The juxtapositions of the two candidates have been occasionally startling, and more than occasionally provided good campaign rhetoric for Mr. Ehrlich. Last July, when Mrs. Townsend had a fund-raiser for glittering contributors at her family's mythic Hyannis Port compound, Mr. Ehrlich held a $20 per person crab-and-beer fest in Anne Arundel County. He remarked at the time, \"We're having fun, obviously. The lieutenant governor is home, and I am home.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the polls tightened during the summer, Mrs. Townsend shed her pledge to wage a \"positive\" campaign and hired longtime Kennedy confidante Robert Shrum, the populist millionaire known for slash-and-burn advertising and rhetoric. Four years ago, Mr. Shrum orchestrated an attack against Gov. Glendening's GOP opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, that called her a racist, a charge that even Democrat and then-Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke repudiated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter Beinart, editor of the New Republic, wrote in the magazine's Oct. 21 issue that \"Election 2002 does have at least one ennobling characteristic: Race has never mattered less.\" But in Maryland that's not true. In a late-September debate held at the predominantly black Morgan State University and sponsored by the allegedly nonpartisan NAACP, Mrs. Townsend attacked her competitor's opposition to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Mr. Ehrlich \"opposes <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> based on race,\" she said, \"Well, let me tell you something, slavery was based on race. Lynching was based on race. Discrimination is based on race. Jim Crow was based on race. And <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should be based on race.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One can question Mr. Ehrlich's consent to debate Mrs. Townsend in such a setting -- his family was booed upon entering the auditorium -- but it's not clear that such demagoguery will work.

While he has voted with the Republican majority in the House 90% of the time, his moderate views on social issues -- qualified support for abortion rights, legalization of marijuana for terminal patients and pro-stem cell research -- hardly squares with her charge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The result of this race might be determined by the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan region, including Maryland's Democratic Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. Mrs. Townsend has aired television advertisements in the past week slamming Mr. Ehrlich for his record on gun control, while on the stump emphasizing her own family's well-known tragedies at the hands of lunatic assassins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether this politicization of a hot-button issue invigorates her base supporters or turns off independents who believe she's exploiting the killings could decide the election.

Negin said, for example, the Environmental Arsenic Council, a trade group of chemical, oil and mining companies, staunchly opposed the new standard already adopted by the Europeans - - and the old federal standard was adopted in 1942, before it was known that arsenic was a carcinogen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Adler may be right about this.

This has sparked much Monday- morning quarterbacking among industry groups and industry-funded folks as to what went wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This issue should have been a 'gimme' for the administration,\" former Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow Jonathan Adler e-mailed CEI President Fred Smith last week, insisting the merits of the issue favored the White House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Despite this . . . the administration got hammered and will continue to get hammered,\" Adler said, by enviros and \"pundits who know less about environmental law than [Environmental Protection Agency chief Christine Todd] Whitman (and that's saying something).\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem? \"Poor communication,\" writes Adler. That plus \"the utter intellectual vacuity and laziness of environmental journalists,\" he said. \"If the arsenic issue cannot be 'won,' it will be hard to win anything that matters.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus the quick turnaround on the pro-salmonella proposal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adler's e-mail notes people should have stressed that there were \"no industry beneficiaries\" in voiding the Clinton move and that there was still a federal arsenic regulation in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enviros such as Elliott Negin of the Natural Resources Defense Council, however, insists the problem was that the facts didn't back the Bush team. Negin said, for example, the Environmental Arsenic Council, a trade group of chemical, oil and mining companies, staunchly opposed the new standard already adopted by the Europeans - - and the old federal standard was adopted in 1942, before it was known that arsenic was a carcinogen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Adler may be right about this. People cringe at the word \"arsenic.\" Industry must level the playing field and rename arsenic. Perhaps \"Rosewater?\" Or \"Passion Mist?\" Maybe \"Old Lace?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What happened to those guys who came up with \"fecal matter?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And now, the first of a likely endless string of fundraisers and political to-dos at the Clinton home in Northwest.

But there's a problem for all those well-heeled PAC folks. It's \"Personal checks only.\" So if you want to see maison Clinton and those new decorations, it's going to come out of your pocket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember the Dan Burton cuff links on eBay for $9.99 that got no bids for five days?

Temperament and political skills, in which Bush and Bradley might contrast favorably with Gary Bauer or Orrin Hatch, are not considered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason Alan Keyes and I are classified as compatible is that neither President Match nor Select Smart gave me the chance to express my reluctance to vote for someone who appears to be out of his mind.

The searing news of the disproportionate rates of COVID-19 among Black Americans has added to the urgency of this moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But not for Donald Trump. His long record of embracing racism as a political tool -- from his promotion of the \"birther\" lie about Barack Obama to his defense of white supremacists -- has made him the most racially polarizing president in the last century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet while many Republican \"Never Trumpers\" condemn Trump for his brazen appeals to white supremacy, they are curiously silent on Ronald Reagan's record on race and civil rights. It's no accident that the Party of Reagan morphed so easily into the Party of Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long before Trump descended his golden escalator, promising to \"Make America Great Again,\" Reagan was the first to use the slogan \"Let's Make America Great Again,\" vowing to return America to its past glory before the civil rights movement toppled Jim Crow in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whenever the issue of Reagan's hostility to civil rights and unpopularity with Black Americans is broached, conservatives leap to Reagan's defense and stress his apparent lack of personal racism. That view has been shredded by the disclosure last year of a phone call in October 1971 between Richard Nixon and Reagan, in which Reagan described African diplomats as \"monkeys\" who were still \"uncomfortable wearing their shoes.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan's sunny vision of America as a \"shining city\" may be the antithesis of Donald Trump's dystopian American \"carnage,\" he masterfully deployed racially coded language and other dog whistles like \"states' rights,\" \"law and order\" and \"welfare queens\" that resonated with middle-class taxpayers without appearing racist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telling illustration is Reagan's decision to give a major speech in his 1980 campaign at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., only miles from where three civil rights workers -- James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner -- were murdered in 1964. Looking back, it is eerily similar to Trump's decision to hold a campaign rally on the day after Juneteenth in Tulsa, Okla., the site of the worst racial massacre in the 20th century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan was the first presidential nominee of a major political party to attend that fair since it started in 1889, and that fact was not lost on the 20,000 white people gathered there on Aug. 3, 1980, many proudly waving Confederate flags and chanting, \"We want Reagan! We want Reagan!\" The crowd was exhilarated with his declaring his fidelity to states' rights, which for a century had been the South's rallying cry to prevent the federal government from interfering with its racial customs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That speech helped Reagan sweep every Southern state except President Carter's home state of Georgia.

Reagan mounted an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination in 1968, in which he crisscrossed the South and white enclaves across the country thrilling conservative audiences with his scorching attacks on lawless civil rights agitators and his tough talk of law and order. Just hours after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, Reagan called King's assassination \"a great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order and people started choosing which laws they'd break.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1976, Reagan, in challenging Gerald Ford for the Republican presidential nomination, popularized the racist trope of a \"welfare queen,\" repeating at virtually every campaign stop, before white audiences, the fictitious story of a Black welfare cheat, subsidized by hardworking white taxpayers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, Reagan's two-term presidency marked a new nadir in race relations.

His administration adopted a series of draconian laws that resulted in the imprisonment rate of African Americans on drug charges that is almost six times that of whites, even though whites use illicit drugs at a similar rate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan eschewed the overt racism of Trump, his racial politics paved the way for Trump. In fact, Reagan's brand of racism was perhaps more sinister than Trump's because he did it with a genial smile. In reckoning with Trump, we need to reckon with Reagan's legacy.

The searing news of the disproportionate rates of COVID-19 among Black Americans has added to the urgency of this moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But not for Donald Trump. His long record of embracing racism as a political tool -- from his promotion of the \"birther\" lie about Barack Obama to his defense of white supremacists -- has made him the most racially polarizing president in the last century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet while many Republican \"Never Trumpers\" condemn Trump for his brazen appeals to white supremacy, they are curiously silent on Ronald Reagan's record on race and civil rights. It's no accident that the Party of Reagan morphed so easily into the Party of Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long before Trump descended his golden escalator, promising to \"Make America Great Again,\" Reagan was the first to use the slogan \"Let's Make America Great Again,\" vowing to return America to its past glory before the civil rights movement toppled Jim Crow in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whenever the issue of Reagan's hostility to civil rights and unpopularity with Black Americans is broached, conservatives leap to Reagan's defense and stress his apparent lack of personal racism. That view has been shredded by the disclosure last year of a phone call in October 1971 between Richard Nixon and Reagan, in which Reagan described African diplomats as \"monkeys\" who were still \"uncomfortable wearing their shoes.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan's sunny vision of America as a \"shining city\" may be the antithesis of Donald Trump's dystopian American \"carnage,\" he masterfully deployed racially coded language and other dog whistles like \"states' rights,\" \"law and order\" and \"welfare queens\" that resonated with middle-class taxpayers without appearing racist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telling illustration is Reagan's decision to give a major speech in his 1980 campaign at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., only miles from where three civil rights workers -- James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner -- were murdered in 1964. Looking back, it is eerily similar to Trump's decision to hold a campaign rally on the day after Juneteenth in Tulsa, Okla., the site of the worst racial massacre in the 20th century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan was the first presidential nominee of a major political party to attend that fair since it started in 1889, and that fact was not lost on the 20,000 white people gathered there on Aug. 3, 1980, many proudly waving Confederate flags and chanting, \"We want Reagan! We want Reagan!\" The crowd was exhilarated with his declaring his fidelity to states' rights, which for a century had been the South's rallying cry to prevent the federal government from interfering with its racial customs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That speech helped Reagan sweep every Southern state except President Carter's home state of Georgia. Since then, the Old Confederacy has been the heart of the GOP.
