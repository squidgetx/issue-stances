Some, like Melville W. Fuller, who presided from 1888 to 1910, inhabit the shadows of the court's history.

It will surprise many people to learn that nothing in the Constitution explicitly authorizes the Supreme Court to decide whether acts of Congress are constitutional. In Marbury vs. Madison, Marshall deduced this power from the structure of government that the Constitution created -- and thus he created the institution of judicial review. More than a century later, Chief Justice Earl Warren led his colleagues to apply constitutional principles to outlaw racial segregation and to expand the rights of criminal defendants. Racial equality and the right to a lawyer may seem like obvious constitutional principles today; they didn't before Warren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When William H. Rehnquist joined the Supreme Court in 1972, he had ambitions that were similar in size but different in substance. Did he succeed? After 33 years on the court, the last 19 as its leader, Rehnquist's record is mixed. The Rehnquist court has slowed the expansion of civil rights but has not reversed it in most areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Victim of Cancer</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief justice has cancer and is mostly working from home. This comes after years of rumors that back troubles would force his resignation. The cancer diagnosis last fall intensified predictions of his impending retirement and sparked new discussions of his legacy and the court's future direction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist found his politics early, in dinner-table discussions with his Milwaukee parents and, after Pearl Harbor, as a neighborhood block captain responsible for reporting \"subversive activities\" to the police. His interest in history, forged in high school reenactments of the nation's founding, has endured in his writings, on the bench and off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those writings, Rehnquist will often hearken back to the period after the Civil War. Many think of the Reconstruction era as one of brutal repression of minorities and a pinched view of the federal government. Rehnquist, however, finds his legal and ideological touchstones in those years: states' rights, a narrow view of congressional authority and a bone-deep skepticism about the notion that law should protect private behavior. As a Supreme Court clerk, Rehnquist wrote memos urging his boss, Justice Robert H. Jackson, to dissent in voting-rights and school desegregation cases. Young Rehnquist scornfully dismissed pleas from criminal defendants. When Rehnquist became a justice himself, he took his own advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist has been least successful in the realm of private behavior. The abortion rights decision, Roe vs. Wade, came a year after he joined the court, and the core of that decision stands three decades later, despite Rehnquist's fierce opposition. The constitutional ban on school prayer also remains. Rehnquist's years saw the court uphold laws forbidding consensual sex among homosexuals and, over his objection, then saw the court reverse itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has had his successes. Rehnquist pushed the court to narrow or reverse many protections the Warren court had declared for criminal suspects, prisoners, racial minorities and students, boosting the authority of police, prosecutors, prison wardens and school officials. He and his colleagues struck down New Deal-era federal laws on the grounds that even the commerce clause of the Constitution -- formerly an all-purpose authority for the use of federal power -- did not authorize them. The Rehnquist court struck down laws concerning gun control, sexual assaults and cigarettes on this basis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States' Rights Booster</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sovereign authority of the states, by contrast, got a boost from Rehnquist. States are now largely free to execute murderers, destroy some inland wetlands and ponds, demote state employees who develop breast cancer or lock up some petty thieves for life, as California has chosen to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stopwatch efficiency that has earned Rehnquist high marks as the court's manager is also evident in his often-sparse opinions. Here it has not served him or the court as well. Instead of articulating principles that can guide judges and lawmakers, Rehnquist has often focused on the facts at hand.

In the years before 2000, the Rehnquist court had rejected equal-protection claims from death row inmates complaining of racial bias, California homeowners challenging wide disparities in the property tax, gays and lesbians who wanted to serve in the military, and so on.

The only question was, Why?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia, a self-described ''far right'' law professor at the University of Texas, was attending the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala at what could only be called a triumphal moment. The Federalist Society, a group of conservative lawyers and academics, has emerged from obscurity to become perhaps the most powerful force in the law today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over four days of panels and soirees, the Federalists were the toast of official Washington. Members of the Bush cabinet, including Attorney General John Ashcroft, joined in the festivities. And Justice Antonin Scalia mused to a packed banquet hall, ''Who would have thought 20 years ago that that little organization of students at a couple of law schools would have evolved today to a power of such proportions?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the legal panels, administration officials fell over themselves to say what the crowd wanted to hear. At a business-law panel, a top Justice Department lawyer talked about settling the Microsoft antitrust case, a move applauded by conservatives, who saw the suit as Clinton-era interference with the prerogatives of big business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But to Mr. Graglia, the administration's business-friendly line sounded like so much liberal claptrap. During the question period, he demanded to know why the administration was bothering to enforce antitrust laws at all. ''It really is time to be bold,'' he insisted. ''The boldest thing to do would be to repeal all the laws.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia wasn't the only conservative who was suffering. A woman stood up to declare herself ''dissatisfied and frustrated'' because the panel had not attacked the states for suing tobacco companies. A law professor fulminated against state attorneys general, like Eliot Spitzer of New York, who, by crusading to clean up the Enrons and WorldComs of the world, have become self-appointed securities commissioners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I must admit that when I headed down to Washington last week, I was expecting to encounter a good deal of gloating. The last time I spent any time with the Federalist Society crowd was on the Harvard Law Review, where a claque of right-leaning law students used to hang out late into the evening, grumbling about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and the New Deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now this same crowd is setting the nation's legal policy and selecting its judges -- with a freer hand than ever since the Republicans retook the Senate. They are using their informal network to place conservative true believers in influential positions throughout the federal government, from Supreme Court clerkships to top agency posts. In fact, one of the late-night Harvard Law Review grumblers from way back when, Miguel Estrada, is now a Federalist Society favorite for the next vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the Federalists' remarkable good fortune, I had expected the banter to be heavy with congratulations and plans for the future. But much of the rumbling in the hallways was of grudges' being lovingly nursed and of potshots' being fired against liberal enemies long ago vanquished.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before one event, a graybeard in the audience tutored a wet-behind-the-ears Federalist on the horrors of Travelgate, in which the Clinton White House did -- well, nothing much, really. At the black-tie banquet, a satirical song took aim at ''Brennan, Marx and Lenin.'' William Brennan, the Supreme Court justice who was being gleefully branded a communist, died in 1997.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The search for fictive liberal enemies reached a loopy low on the convention's last day, when an archconservative federal appeals court judge, Laurence Silberman, accused William Rehnquist's archconservative Supreme Court of having a secret plan to declare the death penalty unconstitutional. In an opinion just last month, the court reiterated its view that capital punishment is constitutional even for 16-year-olds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the event that most captured the spirit of the week was Kenneth Starr's speech and his introduction by Barbara Comstock, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Public Affairs. Between them, Ms. Comstock and Mr. Starr managed to rail against Bill Clinton, James Carville, Lanny Davis, James Jeffords, Alan Dershowitz, the Warren court, trial lawyers and Barbra Streisand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Starr was particularly exercised about liberals' being result-oriented, abandoning their principles to reach the outcomes they favor. But he would have made a more compelling case if he had not proceeded to abandon his -- and the Federalist Society's -- own oft-repeated commitment to judicial restraint to praise the Supreme Court for striking down the Gun-Free School Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act in a burst of conservative activism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was the take-away, as meeting planners like to say, from the Federalist Society's big convention? First, if these are the folks choosing federal judges for the Bush administration -- and they are -- Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans need to be vigilant about investigating nominees' backgrounds, and using the filibuster, to prevent a far-right takeover of the courts. Second, Democrats and moderate Republicans in both houses will need to stand up for mainstream principles that are now under assault, like antitrust law and health and safety regulations. And finally, a point of sportsmanship: the only thing less appealing than a sore loser is a sore winner.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Editorial Observer; Hell Hath No Fury Like a Conservative Who Is Victorious</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lino Graglia was standing in a meeting room at the Mayflower Hotel, and he was hopping mad.

At a business-law panel, a top Justice Department lawyer talked about settling the Microsoft antitrust case, a move applauded by conservatives, who saw the suit as Clinton-era interference with the prerogatives of big business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But to Mr. Graglia, the administration's business-friendly line sounded like so much liberal claptrap. During the question period, he demanded to know why the administration was bothering to enforce antitrust laws at all. ''It really is time to be bold,'' he insisted. ''The boldest thing to do would be to repeal all the laws.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia wasn't the only conservative who was suffering. A woman stood up to declare herself ''dissatisfied and frustrated'' because the panel had not attacked the states for suing tobacco companies. A law professor fulminated against state attorneys general, like Eliot Spitzer of New York, who, by crusading to clean up the Enrons and WorldComs of the world, have become self-appointed securities commissioners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I must admit that when I headed down to Washington last week, I was expecting to encounter a good deal of gloating. The last time I spent any time with the Federalist Society crowd was on the Harvard Law Review, where a claque of right-leaning law students used to hang out late into the evening, grumbling about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and the New Deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now this same crowd is setting the nation's legal policy and selecting its judges -- with a freer hand than ever since the Republicans retook the Senate. They are using their informal network to place conservative true believers in influential positions throughout the federal government, from Supreme Court clerkships to top agency posts. In fact, one of the late-night Harvard Law Review grumblers from way back when, Miguel Estrada, is now a Federalist Society favorite for the next vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the Federalists' remarkable good fortune, I had expected the banter to be heavy with congratulations and plans for the future. But much of the rumbling in the hallways was of grudges' being lovingly nursed and of potshots' being fired against liberal enemies long ago vanquished.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before one event, a graybeard in the audience tutored a wet-behind-the-ears Federalist on the horrors of Travelgate, in which the Clinton White House did -- well, nothing much, really. At the black-tie banquet, a satirical song took aim at ''Brennan, Marx and Lenin.'' William Brennan, the Supreme Court justice who was being gleefully branded a communist, died in 1997.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The search for fictive liberal enemies reached a loopy low on the convention's last day, when an archconservative federal appeals court judge, Laurence Silberman, accused William Rehnquist's archconservative Supreme Court of having a secret plan to declare the death penalty unconstitutional. In an opinion just last month, the court reiterated its view that capital punishment is constitutional even for 16-year-olds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the event that most captured the spirit of the week was Kenneth Starr's speech and his introduction by Barbara Comstock, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Public Affairs. Between them, Ms. Comstock and Mr. Starr managed to rail against Bill Clinton, James Carville, Lanny Davis, James Jeffords, Alan Dershowitz, the Warren court, trial lawyers and Barbra Streisand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Starr was particularly exercised about liberals' being result-oriented, abandoning their principles to reach the outcomes they favor. But he would have made a more compelling case if he had not proceeded to abandon his -- and the Federalist Society's -- own oft-repeated commitment to judicial restraint to praise the Supreme Court for striking down the Gun-Free School Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act in a burst of conservative activism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was the take-away, as meeting planners like to say, from the Federalist Society's big convention? First, if these are the folks choosing federal judges for the Bush administration -- and they are -- Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans need to be vigilant about investigating nominees' backgrounds, and using the filibuster, to prevent a far-right takeover of the courts. Second, Democrats and moderate Republicans in both houses will need to stand up for mainstream principles that are now under assault, like antitrust law and health and safety regulations. And finally, a point of sportsmanship: the only thing less appealing than a sore loser is a sore winner.</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/419426239.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/419426239.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>THOMAS' INSPIRING COURAGE</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Every so often I question whether I've landed on the wrong planet.

But it is also true that no one stirred or so much as cleared his throat during the hour-long speech. And true, too, that Thomas' standing ovation at the end was longer than is required by politeness and more spontaneous than one might naturally expect of a crowd merely tired of sitting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From which I must infer that others in the throng heard the message of \"duty, honor, country\" as I did--as values worthy of the trenches and of our occasional discomfort. Nothing he said evoked \"comparisons to Bill Clinton's defense for pardoning Marc Rich when he said it was easy to say no and took courage to say yes,\" as Dowd wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It doesn't take courage to pardon an unscrupulous criminal in exchange for political favors and possibly huge sums of money, though corruption helps. It does take courage, on the other hand, to fight for your principles, to stand by your convictions, to tell the truth in your heart, as Thomas recommended throughout his speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's what Thomas really talked about, even as he acknowledged some personal understanding of these matters. He mentioned having experienced the firing line, from his Supreme Court confirmation hearings through media portrayals that were painful. He spoke, too, of his experiences as a black man who dares to question such \"black\" issues as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, school busing and welfare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Those who come to engage in debates of consequence, and who challenge accepted wisdom, should expect to be treated badly,\" he said.

Levy is executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I was chancellor of the New York City schools, I thought that if you were smart and poor, you could write your own ticket to college. I was dead wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, where I serve as executive director, reveals that only 3 percent of students at our most selective colleges come from the 25 percent of families with the lowest incomes, while 72 percent come from the richest 25 percent of families.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The unfairness of the situation is compounded by the fact that once admitted, poor students soar academically. According to our study, the poor students who do attend these elite schools graduate at equal rates and earn similarly high grades as their wealthy peers. The Cooke Foundation awards scholarships to exceptionally high-achieving low-income students; 95 percent of Cooke Scholars graduate from these selective schools with top grades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today at selective colleges we have <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for the wealthy. More than 80 percent of the nation's top higher-education institutions give a \"legacy preference\" to children of alumni. Even the \"athletic preference\" has been warped to give the rich a better shot.

I was dead wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, where I serve as executive director, reveals that only 3 percent of students at our most selective colleges come from the 25 percent of families with the lowest incomes, while 72 percent come from the richest 25 percent of families.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The unfairness of the situation is compounded by the fact that once admitted, poor students soar academically. According to our study, the poor students who do attend these elite schools graduate at equal rates and earn similarly high grades as their wealthy peers. The Cooke Foundation awards scholarships to exceptionally high-achieving low-income students; 95 percent of Cooke Scholars graduate from these selective schools with top grades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today at selective colleges we have <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for the wealthy.

There are 36 possible pairs of justices, and in the term just concluded something interesting happened.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The top three spots were all taken by pairs of women. However you matched them up, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan voted together at least 93 percent of the time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The alignments are a product of ideology, not biology. \"They are the three most liberal justices on the court, and it makes sense that they would often be in agreement,\" said Pamela Harris, an adviser to the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown's law school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The voting pattern highlighted the rightward drift of the fourth member of the court's liberal wing, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who broke from his usual allies in a series of important privacy cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, it was often the conservative justices who voted together the most: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., say, or Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. This year, the right was more fractured. (The statistics come from Scotusblog, and the trends hold whether you look at all cases or just divided ones.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three female justices also dominated Supreme Court arguments in the last term. Justice Ginsburg asked the first question 37 percent of the time. Justice Sotomayor asked the most questions, averaging more than 21 in each hourlong argument.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Kagan, a former dean of Harvard Law School and a former United States solicitor general, by many accounts asked the best questions of any of the justices. They were crisp and conversational and probed the heart of the case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The spotlight often captured Justice Sotomayor this term, as her best-selling memoir gave rise to a book tour that drew adoring crowds. She was profiled on \"60 Minutes,\" talked with Oprah Winfrey and Jon Stewart, and visited \"Sesame Street\" and \"The View.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lawyers who appear before her say she is a source of inspiration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think she has come into her own and is establishing herself as a formidable and independent presence,\" said Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter in Washington who has argued 33 cases before the court and served as a law clerk to Justice Ginsburg. \"Like the other two women, she's very comfortable up there, and that's a great thing for a woman like me to see.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked by e-mail for an assessment of Justice Sotomayor, a normally sober political scientist did not stint on her exclamation points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People love her!\" wrote Lee Epstein, who teaches at the University of Southern California. \"She made a lot of money!\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Sotomayor's financial disclosure forms show that she has received more than $3 million for the book.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Ginsburg's form for last year also contained an interesting disclosure.

(Source: Scotusblog)</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Three Justices Bound by Beliefs, Not Just Gender</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WASHINGTON --  You can tell a lot about the Supreme Court by looking at who voted with whom. There are 36 possible pairs of justices, and in the term just concluded something interesting happened.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The top three spots were all taken by pairs of women. However you matched them up, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan voted together at least 93 percent of the time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The alignments are a product of ideology, not biology. \"They are the three most liberal justices on the court, and it makes sense that they would often be in agreement,\" said Pamela Harris, an adviser to the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown's law school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The voting pattern highlighted the rightward drift of the fourth member of the court's liberal wing, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who broke from his usual allies in a series of important privacy cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, it was often the conservative justices who voted together the most: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., say, or Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. This year, the right was more fractured. (The statistics come from Scotusblog, and the trends hold whether you look at all cases or just divided ones.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three female justices also dominated Supreme Court arguments in the last term. Justice Ginsburg asked the first question 37 percent of the time. Justice Sotomayor asked the most questions, averaging more than 21 in each hourlong argument.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Kagan, a former dean of Harvard Law School and a former United States solicitor general, by many accounts asked the best questions of any of the justices. They were crisp and conversational and probed the heart of the case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The spotlight often captured Justice Sotomayor this term, as her best-selling memoir gave rise to a book tour that drew adoring crowds. She was profiled on \"60 Minutes,\" talked with Oprah Winfrey and Jon Stewart, and visited \"Sesame Street\" and \"The View.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lawyers who appear before her say she is a source of inspiration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think she has come into her own and is establishing herself as a formidable and independent presence,\" said Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter in Washington who has argued 33 cases before the court and served as a law clerk to Justice Ginsburg. \"Like the other two women, she's very comfortable up there, and that's a great thing for a woman like me to see.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked by e-mail for an assessment of Justice Sotomayor, a normally sober political scientist did not stint on her exclamation points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People love her!\" wrote Lee Epstein, who teaches at the University of Southern California. \"She made a lot of money!\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Sotomayor's financial disclosure forms show that she has received more than $3 million for the book.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Ginsburg's form for last year also contained an interesting disclosure. In November, she accepted an \"award recipient gift bag\" worth $2,500 -- a swag bag, in the lingo -- when she received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their day jobs, the votes of the three justices are neither wholly predictable nor wholly united, said Lisa T. McElroy, a law professor at Drexel University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's important to note that the agreement was not on 'women's' or 'social justice' issues,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The female justices were divided in two of the term's biggest cases, Professor McElroy added.

Joseph Lieberman as running mate, and tapped Mrs. Townsend instead, it's quite possible she'd be vice president today, stumping for Democratic candidates along with President Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lieberman's peak as a candidate in 2000 occurred on the very day he was chosen by Mr. Gore, with the expected mainstream media exultation at the \"daring\" selection of a Jewish man given the nod. Not only was the Connecticut senator overmatched by Dick Cheney in their one debate, but his hollow threats of censoring the entertainment industry, while accepting massive donations from Hollywood moguls, exposed him as a hypocrite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend was excluded from Mr. Gore's \"short list\" because of her inexperience -- one-and-a-half terms as Maryland's lieutenant governor and a failed congressional race in 1986 -- and presumably because her state is one of the most reliably Democratic in the nation. However, there's little doubt that her candidacy would not have cost Mr. Gore a single state he eventually won against President Bush. In fact, given her pedigree as Robert F. Kennedy's eldest child, with an extended family campaigning for the ticket, it's likely the team would've won New Hampshire, West Virginia and Florida, and thus the election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Mrs. Townsend, never a nimble candidate on her own, is struggling to fend off Republican Rep. Robert Ehrlich in this year's battle to succeed the unpopular Parris Glendening as Maryland's governor. The contest has been mired in a statistical dead heat since mid-summer -- a Mason-Dixon Maryland poll last weekend showed Mrs. Townsend leading Mr. Ehrlich by a 46% to 45% margin -- as Mrs. Townsend has failed to lock up the state's large black electorate, a base of voters that's typically a given for a Democratic candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend's political pitch has been less than perfect. In June she angered Baltimore City's black leaders by choosing retired Navy Admiral Charles Larson, a white former Republican, as her running mate. Mr. Ehrlich, meanwhile, a four-term congressman from Baltimore County, chose a black man, Michael Steele.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fairness, the current political environment, influenced as it's been by corporate scandals and a backlash against wealthy businessmen, doesn't make the most hospitable turf for a candidate born to privilege. In contrast to Mrs. Townsend, Mr. Ehrlich was reared in the blue-collar Baltimore suburb of Arbutus, where he earned an academic/sports scholarship to Princeton. He then returned to Maryland, spending eight years in the state's House of Delegates before being elected to Congress in 1994.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The juxtapositions of the two candidates have been occasionally startling, and more than occasionally provided good campaign rhetoric for Mr. Ehrlich. Last July, when Mrs. Townsend had a fund-raiser for glittering contributors at her family's mythic Hyannis Port compound, Mr. Ehrlich held a $20 per person crab-and-beer fest in Anne Arundel County. He remarked at the time, \"We're having fun, obviously. The lieutenant governor is home, and I am home.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the polls tightened during the summer, Mrs. Townsend shed her pledge to wage a \"positive\" campaign and hired longtime Kennedy confidante Robert Shrum, the populist millionaire known for slash-and-burn advertising and rhetoric. Four years ago, Mr. Shrum orchestrated an attack against Gov. Glendening's GOP opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, that called her a racist, a charge that even Democrat and then-Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke repudiated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter Beinart, editor of the New Republic, wrote in the magazine's Oct. 21 issue that \"Election 2002 does have at least one ennobling characteristic: Race has never mattered less.\" But in Maryland that's not true. In a late-September debate held at the predominantly black Morgan State University and sponsored by the allegedly nonpartisan NAACP, Mrs. Townsend attacked her competitor's opposition to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Mr. Ehrlich \"opposes <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> based on race,\" she said, \"Well, let me tell you something, slavery was based on race. Lynching was based on race. Discrimination is based on race. Jim Crow was based on race. And <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should be based on race.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One can question Mr. Ehrlich's consent to debate Mrs. Townsend in such a setting -- his family was booed upon entering the auditorium -- but it's not clear that such demagoguery will work. A Democratic consultant in Maryland told me that \"KKT won the debate in the hall, but Ehrlich won it on TV because the performance of the NAACP and the mob in the auditorium turned off many white voters.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither is it clear that Mrs. Townsend's caricature of Mr. Ehrlich as a Gingrich-style extremist resonates with voters. While he has voted with the Republican majority in the House 90% of the time, his moderate views on social issues -- qualified support for abortion rights, legalization of marijuana for terminal patients and pro-stem cell research -- hardly squares with her charge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The result of this race might be determined by the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan region, including Maryland's Democratic Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. Mrs. Townsend has aired television advertisements in the past week slamming Mr. Ehrlich for his record on gun control, while on the stump emphasizing her own family's well-known tragedies at the hands of lunatic assassins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether this politicization of a hot-button issue invigorates her base supporters or turns off independents who believe she's exploiting the killings could decide the election. Even Maureen Dowd, the liberal New York Times op-ed columnist criticized Mrs. Townsend, writing on Oct. 16: \"Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is trying to capitalize on her personal history with tragic gun killings to save her limp gubernatorial bid.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An even bigger question is whether citizens in Maryland -- especially in areas where the sniper has killed -- will be motivated to vote on Election Day if the assailant isn't apprehended by then. A low turnout is bad news for Mrs. Townsend, and should Mr. Ehrlich prevail, will terminate her future political career.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Smith, a Baltimore resident for 14 years, is editor-in-chief of the New York Press, for which he writes the \"Mugger\" column.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>The Incredible Shrinking Kennedy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It could have been a far different election season this fall for Maryland's gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two summers ago, had Al Gore and his advisers stretched their imaginations beyond the hyperbolic \"ground-breaking\" choice of Sen.
