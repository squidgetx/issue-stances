After a furor erupted, Ms. Smith clarified her comments in an email to her team that was obtained and published by TechCrunch. It reads in part, \"Understanding that diversity includes women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. people, and all underrepresented minorities is at the heart of our work to create an environment that is inclusive of everyone,\" and \"I regret the choice of words I used to make this point.\"But Ms. Smith wasn't the first to endorse the view in her initial statement. Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of \"cognitive diversity\" is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of -- individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.This overlaps with the sentiments expressed in a screed by a Google software engineer that critiqued the company's race and gender diversity efforts and ascribed the unequal representation of women in tech to \"biological causes.\" It included the line, \"Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity.\"To be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important. But working to increase them alone won't do anything to address the well-documented shortcomings that plague tech companies. Whether companies do it intentionally or not, I worry that they will adjust the definition of diversity so that, conveniently, it's already achieved.If our focus shifts to cognitive diversity, it could provide an easy way around doing the hard work of increasing the embarrassingly low numbers of blacks and Latinos in the ranks of employees, in leadership roles, as suppliers and vendors, and on boards. The leadership of Apple, where Ms. Smith works, was only 3 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic  in 2016. A recent report by Recode found that women made up at most 30 percent of leadership roles and no more than 27 percent of technical roles at major tech companies. The percentages of black and Latino employees in leadership was even more dismal, ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.The shift toward focusing on viewpoint or cognitive diversity may trace its roots back to the 1978 Supreme Court decision Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which set the stage for schools to consider race in admissions because of the educational benefits of diversity, rather than to redress prior discrimination. It is understandable that because the public discourse around <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> shifted along these lines, some came to believe that any kind of diversity -- including cognitive diversity -- must be equally valuable. But that means that the most meaningful ways through which this is formed (cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability and especially gender and racial differences) may be forgotten.If this happens, we could lose an important check on the tendency of people who work at tech companies to hire more people like themselves. According to the Society for Human Resources Management, employee referrals accounted for over 30 percent of all hires in 2016. Employees typically recommend people similar to them in racial identity and gender, so it requires dedicated effort to recruit and hire people who don't already have identities that match up with those of current employees. Counting up variations of \"viewpoints\" -- however one might do so -- won't achieve that. And, to potential applicants from underrepresented groups, statements about \"cognitive diversity\" will send an unwelcoming message about a company's real priorities for inclusion.As my former Facebook colleague Regina Dugan said recently, even if cognitive diversity is a company's ultimate goal, \"we can't step away from the idea that diversity also looks like identity diversity.\" The effort to hire people with different points of view must not come at the expense of hiring members of actual underrepresented communities who add tangible, bottom-line value -- and who deserve to work in tech as much as anyone.Ms. Smith said in the email clarifying her remarks, \"Our commitment at Apple to increasing racial and gender diversity is as strong as it's ever been.\" That kind of diversity -- the old-fashioned kind, that still remains elusive -- is what I hope my industry won't abandon.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This overlaps with the sentiments expressed in a screed by a Google software engineer that critiqued the company's race and gender diversity efforts and ascribed the unequal representation of women in tech to \"biological causes.\" It included the line, \"Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important. But working to increase them alone won't do anything to address the well-documented shortcomings that plague tech companies. Whether companies do it intentionally or not, I worry that they will adjust the definition of diversity so that, conveniently, it's already achieved.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If our focus shifts to cognitive diversity, it could provide an easy way around doing the hard work of increasing the embarrassingly low numbers of blacks and Latinos in the ranks of employees, in leadership roles, as suppliers and vendors, and on boards. The leadership of Apple, where Ms. Smith works, was only 3 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic  in 2016. A recent report by Recode found that women made up at most 30 percent of leadership roles and no more than 27 percent of technical roles at major tech companies. The percentages of black and Latino employees in leadership was even more dismal, ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shift toward focusing on viewpoint or cognitive diversity may trace its roots back to the 1978 Supreme Court decision Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which set the stage for schools to consider race in admissions because of the educational benefits of diversity, rather than to redress prior discrimination. It is understandable that because the public discourse around <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> shifted along these lines, some came to believe that any kind of diversity -- including cognitive diversity -- must be equally valuable. But that means that the most meaningful ways through which this is formed (cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability and especially gender and racial differences) may be forgotten.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If this happens, we could lose an important check on the tendency of people who work at tech companies to hire more people like themselves. According to the Society for Human Resources Management, employee referrals accounted for over 30 percent of all hires in 2016. Employees typically recommend people similar to them in racial identity and gender, so it requires dedicated effort to recruit and hire people who don't already have identities that match up with those of current employees. Counting up variations of \"viewpoints\" -- however one might do so -- won't achieve that. And, to potential applicants from underrepresented groups, statements about \"cognitive diversity\" will send an unwelcoming message about a company's real priorities for inclusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As my former Facebook colleague Regina Dugan said recently, even if cognitive diversity is a company's ultimate goal, \"we can't step away from the idea that diversity also looks like identity diversity.\" The effort to hire people with different points of view must not come at the expense of hiring members of actual underrepresented communities who add tangible, bottom-line value -- and who deserve to work in tech as much as anyone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Smith said in the email clarifying her remarks, \"Our commitment at Apple to increasing racial and gender diversity is as strong as it's ever been.\" That kind of diversity -- the old-fashioned kind, that still remains elusive -- is what I hope my industry won't abandon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>BARI A.

And as news it's not in the same league as the total war waged against Harvard president Lawrence Summers for having had the temerity to suggest that factors in addition to prejudice might have something to do with the under-representation of women in math and the sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, what happened at Purdue is a pungent reminder of all that's possible now in the rarefied ideological atmosphere on our college campuses -- and in this presidential election year, not perhaps only on our campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story began prosaically enough. Keith Sampson, a student employee on the janitorial staff earning his way toward a degree, was in the habit of reading during work breaks. Last October he was immersed in \"Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson was in short order visited by his union representative, who informed him he must not bring this book to the break room, and that he could be fired. Taking the book to the campus, Mr. Sampson says he was told, was \"like bringing pornography to work.\" That it was a history of the battle students waged against the Klan in the 1920s in no way impressed the union rep.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The assistant <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer who next summoned the student was similarly unimpressed. Indeed she was, Mr. Sampson says, irate at his explanation that he was, after all, reading a scholarly book. \"The Klan still rules Indiana,\" Marguerite Watkins told him -- didn't he know that? Mr. Sampson, by now dazed, pointed out that this book was carried in the university library. Yes, she retorted, you can get Klan propaganda in the library.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university has allowed no interviews with Ms. Watkins or any other university official involved in the case. Still, there can be no disputing the contents of the official letter that set forth the university's case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson stood accused of \"openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your Black co-workers.\" The statement, signed by chief <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer Lillian Charleston, asserted that her office had completed its investigation of the charges brought by Ms. Nakea William, his co- worker -- that Mr. Sampson had continued, despite complaints, to read a book on this \"inflammatory topic.\" \"We conclude,\" the letter informed him, \"that your conduct constitutes racial harassment. . . .\" A very serious matter, with serious consequences, it went on to point out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was in November. Months later, in February of this year, Mr. Sampson received -- from the same source -- a letter with an astonishingly transformed version of his offense. And there could be no mystery as to the cause of this change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the official judgment against him, Mr. Sampson turned to Indiana state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, whose office contacted university attorneys. Worse, the case got some sharp local press coverage that threatened to get wider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ludicrous harassment cases are not rare at our institutions of higher learning. But there was undeniably something special -- something pure, and glorious -- in the clarity of this picture. A university had brought a case against a student on grounds of a book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so the new letter to Mr. Sampson by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer Charleston brought word that she wished to clarify her previous letter, and to say it was \"permissible for him to read scholarly books or other materials on break time.\" About the essential and only theme of the first letter -- the \"racially abhorrent\" subject of the book -- or the warnings that any \"future substantiated conduct of a similar nature could mean serious disciplinary action\" -- there was not a word. She had meant in that first letter, she said, only to address \"conduct\" that caused concern among his co-workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What that conduct was, the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer did not reveal -- but she had delivered the message rewriting the history of the case. Absolutely and for certain there had been no problem about any book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This, indeed, was now the official story -- as any journalist asking about the case would learn instantly from the university's media relations representatives. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved -- if not much -- by the extraordinary efforts of these tormented agents trying to explain that the first letter was all wrong: No reading of any book had anything to do with the charges against Mr. Sampson. This means, I asked one, that Mr. Sampson could have been reading about the adventures of Jack and Jill and he still would have been charged? Yes. What, then, was the offense? \"Harassing behavior.\" While reading the book? The question led to careful explanations hopeless in tone -- for good reason -- and well removed from all semblance of reason. What the behavior was, one learned, could never be revealed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was, of course, no other offensive behavior; had there been any it would surely have appeared in the first letter's gusher of accusation. Like those prosecutors who invent new charges when the first ones fail in court, the administrators threw in the mysterious harassment count. Such were the operations of the university's guardians of equity and justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In April -- having been pressed by the potent national watchdog group FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) as well as the ACLU -- University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz finally sent them a letter expressing regret over this affair, and testifying to his profound commitment to freedom of expression. So far as can be ascertained, the university has extended no such expressions of regret to Keith Sampson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This case and all its kind are worth bearing in mind for anyone pondering the hypersensitivity surrounding the issue of race today. The mindset that produces those harassment courts, those super-heated capacities for perceiving insult, is not limited to college campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its presence is evident in this election campaign, which has seen more than a touch of readiness to impute some form of racism to all tough criticisms of Barack Obama. The deranged response that greeted Bill Clinton's remark that certain of Sen. Obama's claims were \"a fairy tale,\" told the story. No need to go into the now famous catalogue of accusations about the Clintons' \"sly racist\" tactics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There will be much more ahead, directed to the Republicans and their candidate. Some more, no doubt, about the Willie Horton ad of 1988, whose status as a quintessential piece of racism is -- except for a few rare voices of reason -- accepted throughout our media as revealed truth. To be sure, the Willie Horton charge has for some time been over-shadowed by ominous predictions of all the Swiftboating Republicans are supposed to be readying.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Obama himself, the candidate of racial transcendence, has now taken a plunge of sorts to old-style race politics. In a preemptive dismissal of future criticism, he warned a Florida audience on June 20, of the racist tactics the Republicans planned. \"We know the strategy,\" he said. Republicans planned to make people afraid of him. They'd say \"he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this may be far from the world of the universities.

I realized Miguel was right on one score: It would be unfair for him to get a break for his race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miguel had the background and benefits he needed to succeed on his own. Both his parents are UC graduates and bilingual. His public school ranked in the nation's top 100 academically. And he wanted for nothing at home. He had his own room with his own computer and even a loft with a spiral staircase.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hardly a hard-luck case. Clearly, if he didn't make the grade, he'd have only himself to blame. Still, I couldn't agree with his conclusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why kill a program designed to compensate for social disadvantages just because you don't suffer any?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about his less privileged peers? The students from poor areas who have to work to survive. Who sleep on couches and study in closets because their homes are so crowded. Whose parents don't speak English and don't have even high school diplomas. Whose schools are short on textbooks and good teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> once pried open opportunities in an era when politicians stood in schoolhouse doors to keep minorities out. The goal was to integrate institutions that helped perpetuate racial disparities outside their ivy-covered walls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, disparities are still stark, but we can be more selective. We can target students who really need help. Just consider the list of high schools that send the most and the fewest students to UC.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, admission and affluence are correlated. Just as race and affluence are. Communities at the top of the admissions list: Palos Verdes, Irvine, Palo Alto. Those near the bottom: Santa Ana, Compton and East San Jose, where I grew up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These underrepresented areas will be the ones to benefit most under the new plan that broadens UC eligibility to all students who rank in the top 4% of their high schools. The modest plan doesn't guarantee they'll be admitted. It simply helps identify rural and inner-city students in junior year who should be aspiring to UC, says Manuel Gomez, a UC Irvine vice chancellor and my old college friend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university already knows an extra push can make the difference in a district like Santa Ana, which is only 3% white. A UC Irvine outreach program this year helped 23 Valley High School students boost their SAT scores by an average of almost 100 points, including one kid who soared 270 points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The students paid $35 for the Kaplan Review, a $700 prep course. And even that nominal fee was refunded for those with perfect attendance on weekends and after school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the kids got their money back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm told the university already considers social factors in accepting students. Success in the face of adversity counts extra. That's not a race-based policy. It's just that some races see more adversity than others. That's reality-based.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Students who achieve highly within their own set of circumstances ought to be acknowledged and rewarded for it,\" said Bob Laird, director of undergraduate admissions at my alma mater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even my son saw the light after we had a talk.

I realized Miguel was right on one score: It would be unfair for him to get a break for his race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miguel had the background and benefits he needed to succeed on his own. Both his parents are UC graduates and bilingual. His public school ranked in the nation's top 100 academically. And he wanted for nothing at home. He had his own room with his own computer and even a loft with a spiral staircase.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hardly a hard-luck case. Clearly, if he didn't make the grade, he'd have only himself to blame. Still, I couldn't agree with his conclusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why kill a program designed to compensate for social disadvantages just because you don't suffer any?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about his less privileged peers? The students from poor areas who have to work to survive. Who sleep on couches and study in closets because their homes are so crowded. Whose parents don't speak English and don't have even high school diplomas. Whose schools are short on textbooks and good teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> once pried open opportunities in an era when politicians stood in schoolhouse doors to keep minorities out. The goal was to integrate institutions that helped perpetuate racial disparities outside their ivy-covered walls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, disparities are still stark, but we can be more selective. We can target students who really need help. Just consider the list of high schools that send the most and the fewest students to UC.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, admission and affluence are correlated. Just as race and affluence are. Communities at the top of the admissions list: Palos Verdes, Irvine, Palo Alto. Those near the bottom: Santa Ana, Compton and East San Jose, where I grew up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These underrepresented areas will be the ones to benefit most under the new plan that broadens UC eligibility to all students who rank in the top 4% of their high schools. The modest plan doesn't guarantee they'll be admitted. It simply helps identify rural and inner-city students in junior year who should be aspiring to UC, says Manuel Gomez, a UC Irvine vice chancellor and my old college friend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university already knows an extra push can make the difference in a district like Santa Ana, which is only 3% white. A UC Irvine outreach program this year helped 23 Valley High School students boost their SAT scores by an average of almost 100 points, including one kid who soared 270 points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The students paid $35 for the Kaplan Review, a $700 prep course. And even that nominal fee was refunded for those with perfect attendance on weekends and after school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the kids got their money back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm told the university already considers social factors in accepting students. Success in the face of adversity counts extra. That's not a race-based policy. It's just that some races see more adversity than others. That's reality-based.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Students who achieve highly within their own set of circumstances ought to be acknowledged and rewarded for it,\" said Bob Laird, director of undergraduate admissions at my alma mater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even my son saw the light after we had a talk. In his final draft, Miguel reconsidered his <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> ban in light of \"the quietly segregated ways of the United States.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His final recommendation: \"Give equal opportunity to everybody who tries hard and a chance for success to all who pursue it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's my boy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Agustin Gurza's column appears Tuesday and Saturday.

But then, on a cold day in March, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new president pulled no punches, laying blame for the country's financial woes squarely on Wall Street speculators -- and, by implication, on their benefactors in Washington. \"They have no vision,\" he said, citing a passage from the Bible, \"and when there is no vision, the people perish.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Roosevelt, by contrast, clearly articulated a vision that reawakened the hope of a beleaguered nation. He spoke that day of the country's greatest need -- putting people back to work -- and he laid out a plan for achieving that goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Decades later, when Americans faced a serious recession, Bill Clinton reflected on the same biblical passage when accepting the presidential nomination at the 1992 Democratic Convention. \"I hope nobody ... in our beloved country has to go through tomorrow without a vision,\" he said. \"I hope no one ever tries to raise a child without a vision. I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the ground without a vision. For where there is no vision, the people perish.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans today aren't interested in slogans and sound bites. They want the candidates to offer them a vision, but so far neither Mitt Romney nor President Obama has done so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans are recycling tired promises from the Reagan era, preaching a gospel of small government and fiscal responsibility. But their words ring hollow. Republicans have been sounding that theme for decades, but they've never put it into practice. Reagan tripled the national debt. George W. Bush nearly doubled it, and left a legacy of debt from two unfunded wars and unfunded tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a messaging strategist who has worked with office-seekers and officeholders at all levels of government, including the presidency, I have closely examined the reaction of voters to the standard Republican narrative about taking care of \"job creators\" and eliminating \"red tape that's strangling business.\" The response of voters across the political spectrum is lukewarm. Americans may yet elect Romney, but it won't be because they really buy what he's selling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters aren't hearing a clear message from Obama either. On the one hand, he's pushing for more stimulus, but he is also the architect of a \"grand bargain\" that will cut more than $2 trillion from the 2013 federal budget, imposing the same kind of \"austerity\" that has proved so counterproductive in Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why hasn't either candidate offered a clear vision that resonates with the American people?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is that, in a time that requires boldness, the two presidential candidates are both cautious by nature. But there are other reasons as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is the role of money in politics. Roosevelt attacked Wall Street in his first speech as president, and backed up his rhetoric with one piece of legislation after another to limit its power. He used government money to put Americans directly to work -- something no one had dreamed of doing before -- and created Social Security, a minimum wage and unemployment insurance. In today's political culture, presidential candidates and legislators are beholden to Wall Street to support their campaigns, which has made the passage of such measures inconceivable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second reason for the paucity of vision is historical. For nearly 50 years, the Roosevelt legacy guided Democratic and Republican presidents alike. Dwight Eisenhower scoffed at the idea, proposed by his right flank, of dismantling New Deal programs, and instead expanded the role of the federal government by creating the interstate highway system. Richard Nixon greatly extended the federal government's role in protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink by creating the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came Ronald Reagan, who drew on his charisma to undo as much of what Roosevelt built as he could. He did so by sounding themes that resonated with voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One was based on a legitimate concern that once a government program was created, it developed barnacle-like constituencies that made it as difficult to dismantle as a barrier reef. A second theme was racial, with talk of Cadillac-driving \"welfare queens.\" This was a continuation of Nixon's \"Southern strategy\" that served to solidify the GOP stronghold in the South. A third spoke to the aftershock of the 1960s, one of the most rapid periods of social change in history. This was a note that resonated with many Americans, particularly with white working-class males who'd been left frightened and angry by the women's movement and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which challenged them both at home and at work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at its heart Reagan's critique was of a government that was too powerful, too large, too intrusive. What he didn't mention was that the radical deregulation that he set in motion was also making government more corrupt with every passing campaign dollar. The result was a rising tide of inequality and insecurity for ordinary Americans unseen since the Depression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, the parties and their standard-bearers continue to labor under the broken ideology of Reagan -- an ideology that led, in the hands of George W. Bush, to the Great Recession of 2008. The struggles of working- and middle-class Americans four years later reflect the failure of any leader to transcend Reagan's ideology. Romney continues to claim it as his own, while Obama hasn't offered a coherent alternative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1987, when Reagan's vice president, George H.W. Bush, was considering a run for the presidency, he was casting about for campaign themes when a friend urged him to take some time to think about what vision he wanted to offer the American people.

Patrick Fitzgerald's Thursday news conference about the Duff financial empire. It was time for lunch; I was hungry and wanted to think this through. There was only one place to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You've just got to go to Gene's,\" said a friend and colleague. She meant my favorite steakhouse, and the Duffs' favorite steakhouse, Gene & Georgetti's.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gene's is a hangout where information is traded, among politicians, insiders, reporters, wise-guys, salesmen, consultants, from the buttoned down to the gold chains crowd. And what makes it work is that they serve the best steak in the city, period. The service is impeccable without being showy and the drinks are honest. Gene's is a part of the old Chicago, the city as it was before so much of the downtown was turned into a theme park.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also the place where the Duffs came up to me about a year ago, their tough, hard eyes smiling. They asked me why they don't ever see my children playing in the front yard of my home in the suburbs. They asked it twice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the columns didn't stop and neither did the news stories by the investigative reporters, or Tribune editorials about the mayor's friends. And here's why:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not about getting personal with the mayor or the Duffs. Though the mayor has been a frequent target in my column, what drives the criticism is the obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars that go to his pals. In deal after deal after deal, the attitude is that his guys can take what they want and the people in the neighborhoods better shut up about it, while higher taxes put more and more pressure on families to pay for the deals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not personal, it's business, and it's your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley is an able politician and has done some good things, including taking personal responsibility for trying to improve the public schools. But he must also take personal responsibility for his friends who get rich on government contracts he controls, paid for by our tax dollars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Duff stories broke in 1999, when Tribune investigative reporters Ray Gibson, Andrew Martin and Laurie Cohen wrote about the Duffs' City Hall deals and their connections to Daley and the Outfit. You can find the archive of the stories available on the Tribune's Web site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of what was alleged in the indictments was laid out in those stories: that the Duffs, who are white, ran phony front companies that got $100 million in city contracts that should have gone to firms owned by women or minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley knew the Duffs were not minorities, even when he was a crime-fighting Cook County state's attorney. A Duff sits across from you, gives you campaign cash, pours a drink, it's reasonable to assume that even the mayor could tell whether the person was white or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Think back to how the media treated the late Mayor Harold Washington, when Washington's buddies were involved in contract scandals. Back then, even minor stories about corruption got sustained media attention, particularly from TV and radio, even if the dollar amounts were only chump change. Washington faced constant media pressure on corruption issues. TV crawled all over him for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If I was white, you wouldn't be doing this to me,\" Washington said once, in a private moment, as he filched a smoke from me and we stood in a parking lot after a campaign stop. We argued about it, and I told him that since we were off the record, he didn't have to play the race card. \"You don't know anything, do you?\" he said. He was right. I was a kid, then. I didn't know.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the Duff stories first broke, involving a white mayor and white guys getting rich, the Chicago media scrutiny wasn't as intense. TV news didn't hound Daley the way it hounded Washington. The mayor must appreciate the kindness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm sure he also appreciates the new federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald. The feds have already outflanked former Gov. George Ryan's Republicans. Ryan himself is a target. And now the feds are moving toward Daley's Democratic City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Daley-Duff relationship is not just a Tribune story anymore. A group of citizens--sworn as federal grand jurors--looked at the evidence. They didn't find a flaw in the system, as the city claims. They found a crime.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A couple friends and I talked of this at Gene's, about the change in things, about the importance of an independent federal prosecutor, about how the bipartisan political clique that runs this state tried to stop Fitzgerald's appointment in hopes of installing one of their own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just then, the cell phones began chirping and word of the Duff indictments began to spread through the bar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had our steaks medium rare. And they were tasty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Duff indictments a story you can sink teeth into</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the friends of the mayor of Chicago--friends from a family with connections to the Chicago Outfit--are about to be indicted by a federal grand jury in a $100 million <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> contract fraud scheme, word gets around fast.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So last week, word about the Duffs fanned out from City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there were a couple hours to kill before U.S. Atty.

And what makes it work is that they serve the best steak in the city, period. The service is impeccable without being showy and the drinks are honest. Gene's is a part of the old Chicago, the city as it was before so much of the downtown was turned into a theme park.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also the place where the Duffs came up to me about a year ago, their tough, hard eyes smiling. They asked me why they don't ever see my children playing in the front yard of my home in the suburbs. They asked it twice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the columns didn't stop and neither did the news stories by the investigative reporters, or Tribune editorials about the mayor's friends. And here's why:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not about getting personal with the mayor or the Duffs. Though the mayor has been a frequent target in my column, what drives the criticism is the obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars that go to his pals. In deal after deal after deal, the attitude is that his guys can take what they want and the people in the neighborhoods better shut up about it, while higher taxes put more and more pressure on families to pay for the deals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not personal, it's business, and it's your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley is an able politician and has done some good things, including taking personal responsibility for trying to improve the public schools. But he must also take personal responsibility for his friends who get rich on government contracts he controls, paid for by our tax dollars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Duff stories broke in 1999, when Tribune investigative reporters Ray Gibson, Andrew Martin and Laurie Cohen wrote about the Duffs' City Hall deals and their connections to Daley and the Outfit. You can find the archive of the stories available on the Tribune's Web site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of what was alleged in the indictments was laid out in those stories: that the Duffs, who are white, ran phony front companies that got $100 million in city contracts that should have gone to firms owned by women or minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley knew the Duffs were not minorities, even when he was a crime-fighting Cook County state's attorney. A Duff sits across from you, gives you campaign cash, pours a drink, it's reasonable to assume that even the mayor could tell whether the person was white or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Think back to how the media treated the late Mayor Harold Washington, when Washington's buddies were involved in contract scandals. Back then, even minor stories about corruption got sustained media attention, particularly from TV and radio, even if the dollar amounts were only chump change. Washington faced constant media pressure on corruption issues. TV crawled all over him for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If I was white, you wouldn't be doing this to me,\" Washington said once, in a private moment, as he filched a smoke from me and we stood in a parking lot after a campaign stop. We argued about it, and I told him that since we were off the record, he didn't have to play the race card. \"You don't know anything, do you?\" he said. He was right. I was a kid, then. I didn't know.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the Duff stories first broke, involving a white mayor and white guys getting rich, the Chicago media scrutiny wasn't as intense. TV news didn't hound Daley the way it hounded Washington. The mayor must appreciate the kindness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm sure he also appreciates the new federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald. The feds have already outflanked former Gov. George Ryan's Republicans. Ryan himself is a target. And now the feds are moving toward Daley's Democratic City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Daley-Duff relationship is not just a Tribune story anymore. A group of citizens--sworn as federal grand jurors--looked at the evidence. They didn't find a flaw in the system, as the city claims. They found a crime.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A couple friends and I talked of this at Gene's, about the change in things, about the importance of an independent federal prosecutor, about how the bipartisan political clique that runs this state tried to stop Fitzgerald's appointment in hopes of installing one of their own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just then, the cell phones began chirping and word of the Duff indictments began to spread through the bar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had our steaks medium rare. And they were tasty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2565796466.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2565796466.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>Opinion: California's values, not just Gavin Newsom, are on the recall ballot</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In opposing the recall of Gov.

For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent.
