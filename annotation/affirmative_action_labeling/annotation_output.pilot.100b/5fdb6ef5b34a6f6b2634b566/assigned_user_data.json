But I probably will never forget his three words of advice:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Make yourself indispensable.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to find three better words that sum up the successful business philosophy of John Harold Johnson, who died Monday at age 87.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To black Americans of my generation, Johnson's publications Ebony, Jet and Negro Digest were indispensable reading matter, offering a brighter and more prosperous vision of black America than most of the mainstream--also known as \"white-owned\"--media provided.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To advertisers, Johnson's pioneering publications broke through the myth that the black consumer market was not worth targeting through black-owned media.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today the newsstands are filled with magazines niche-marketed to blacks or Hispanics, but that really began with Johnson back in the 1940s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And to journalists, particularly black journalists, Johnson's publications provided employment, a training ground and a model for how people of color might be covered in a more complete fashion than simply crime, sports or show business stories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His 1989 autobiography \"Succeeding Against the Odds\" reads almost like a business-school series of case studies in how to solve whatever problems life throws at you.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Arkansas refused to educate black children in his area past the 8th grade, his mother, Gertrude Johnson Williams, a cook and domestic worker, saved for two years to move her family to Chicago in the 1930s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Young Johnnie was working days at a black-owned life insurance company and studying at night at Northwestern University when he started up Negro Digest in 1942 with $500 that his mother raised by borrowing against the family furniture.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When its circulation stalled at 50,000 a few months later, he persisted in requesting a guest column from Eleanor Roosevelt until she agreed, immediately boosting circulation to 100,000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1945, Johnson launched Ebony, a picture magazine for blacks. Its initial press run of 25,000 copies was completely sold out. Pocket-size Jet magazine began in 1951. Jet helped launch the modern civil rights movement in 1955 when it published open-casket funeral photos of the mangled body of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Chicagoan who was savagely murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite its annual special editions focusing thoughtfully on major issues of black politics and economics, we black journalists, among others, often ridiculed the sugar-coated emphasis that Ebony and Jet put on the upwardly ambitious black middle class. Yet we also understood Johnson's reluctance to focus on negative news about black life, since there was so much of that in the mainstream media.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bourgeois flavor of Johnson's publications was a minor criticism in the life of a man who overcame tremendous hardships to fill an important vacuum in black life and become one of America's wealthiest businessmen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With that in mind, his \"make yourself indispensable\" speech had special resonance. Speaking to his audience of predominately young and aspiring print and broadcast journalists, he offered us the example of Matthew Henson, the black man who helped Adm. Robert Peary reach the North Pole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Henson was not hired under any <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> plan or out of the goodness of Peary's heart, Johnson pointed out. Henson was hired because he had taken the time to learn the language of the Inuit people, who were indispensable to their journey.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Johnson did not mention was the equally fascinating story of how he gave an autographed copy of Henson's autobiography to Zenith Electronics Corp. chief executive officer Eugene McDonald, after hearing that McDonald was a fan of arctic explorers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McDonald was impressed enough by the gift and by a four-page Ebony feature on Henson that Zenith became Ebony's first major corporate advertiser in the 1950s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He helped persuade other major corporate advertisers to follow, a major breakthrough at the time for black-oriented media. Two decades later, Johnson was elected to Zenith's board of directors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Johnson's career was full of stories like that. His life presents case studies in leadership, which is, above all, the art of problem solving.

Critics, of whom there are many, call it an overpriced indulgence for the affluent few who do not have to worry about earning a living upon graduation. Fewer and fewer of today's undergraduates are pursuing the liberal arts, with most of them studying practical subjects like finance, marketing, real estate and pharmacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But James O. Freedman, 67, the retired president of Dartmouth, remains more committed than ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Liberal education opens our eyes to what life is principally about,'' he said. ''It's about understanding yourself and having some resources to deal with everything life throws at you. It's about developing a moral compass and some understanding of how society works, how democracies work.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At home in Cambridge, with his new book, ''Liberal Education and the Public Interest'' (University of Iowa Press, 2003), an ode to the value of liberal education, on the coffee table in front of him, Mr. Freedman makes his case with passion. Contrary to what critics might say, when it comes to getting a job in today's economy, Mr. Freedman says a liberal education is an important advantage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''A liberal education is what teaches people how to write and how to think and makes them much more valuable in the job market over a 40-year career than graduates of a preprofessional program,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''All the employers will tell you that they're seeking the flexibility of mind that a liberal education imbues.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His book came out in January, as he was battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system. The chemotherapy he has been undergoing since September is working.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the fall, with a tumor pressing against the nerves of his lower back, he was using a wheelchair. Now, he needs only a cane to navigate the stairs of the Victorian home he shares with his wife, Sheba.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is Mr. Freedman's fourth bout with cancer since 1994, and just as he writes in his book that a liberal education enables us to see life more clearly, so has he looked clearly at his illness. The odds are that it will return again in a year, he says, and while he hopes to watch his three small grandchildren grow up, he says, there is no way of knowing just how many years he has.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is focusing, as ever, on writing, and speaking out for the liberal values that he has spent his lifetime working for and that he now sees eroding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Life is what we are doing now,'' he writes in his book, reflecting upon the importance of an early commitment to the values of liberal arts, equal education, idealism and public service.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his desk upstairs are a thousand pages of his fourth book: a memoir that moves from his growing up as the son of a high school English teacher in Manchester, N.H., to his undergraduate days at Harvard, where, he says, he was too timid and conventional to be a brilliant student, and on to Yale Law School, where he blossomed intellectually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The book ends at age 27, when he was a law clerk for Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, one of his heroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman put his knowledge of the law to use recently, when, as a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, he helped prepare a brief for the United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The future of America depends on educating minority men and women,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his 11 years as president of Dartmouth, Mr. Freedman devoted himself to making the college welcoming to what he called the creative loners, cellists, poets and mathematicians, as well as athletes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also carved out a role as a public intellectual, standing up to a group of right-wing students -- and their prominent, adult benefactors -- who were ridiculing blacks, homosexuals, women and Jews on campus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making their views known through the neoconservative, off-campus Dartmouth Review, the students ran a front page cartoon that showed Mr. Freedman, who is Jewish, dressed like Adolf Hitler. Eventually, tolerance and civility were restored.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last September, concerned by news reports that Jewish students were being intimidated on campuses amid protests over the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Freedman helped collect signatures from 310 college presidents for a statement calling for ''intimidation-free'' campuses. Some presidents criticized the statement for focusing only on Jewish students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With heavy snow falling on the streets of Cambridge, Mr. Freedman was relaxing in his living room, with Sheba, his wife of nearly 40 years, across from him. They were surrounded by some of Mr. Freedman's 2,000 favorite books, by T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, Saul Bellow, Faulkner, Joyce.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lifelong book collector, Mr. Freedman reluctantly parted with 4,000 other favorites when he left Dartmouth -- and the library at the president's house -- for Cambridge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward evening, the doorbell rang. Howard Gardner, the Harvard educational psychologist who is one of Mr. Freedman's closest friends, came in from the snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In retirement, as an elder statesman of academia, Mr. Freedman's advice is sought frequently. Professor Gardner wanted to consult with him about three academics who needed jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman is ''the ultimate search engine,'' Professor Gardner said, ''because he knows so many people, in so many ways, heart, mind, spirit.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Life is unpredictable and full of disappointment, Mr. Freedman writes in his book, the breakup of marriages, death of loved ones, enduring illness. In such a world, he writes, ''how ought one to lead a life?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''That is one of the questions that a liberal education addresses,'' he writes. ''The most effective protection against the contingencies of experience are values that appeal to our very best natures and anchor us most securely in the ocean of fate.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are the kinds of subjects Dr. Donald Kaufman, one of Mr. Freedman's oncologists, says he enjoys discussing with the former college president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''I always reserve 30 minutes for his visits,'' Dr. Kaufman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''They go on for 90. This is for my benefit, not his. He's teaching me what it means to be a patient. He's teaching people how to live.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James O.

Gunther for The New York Times)</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Justifying a Liberal Arts Education in Difficult Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberal education is under siege. Critics, of whom there are many, call it an overpriced indulgence for the affluent few who do not have to worry about earning a living upon graduation. Fewer and fewer of today's undergraduates are pursuing the liberal arts, with most of them studying practical subjects like finance, marketing, real estate and pharmacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But James O. Freedman, 67, the retired president of Dartmouth, remains more committed than ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Liberal education opens our eyes to what life is principally about,'' he said. ''It's about understanding yourself and having some resources to deal with everything life throws at you. It's about developing a moral compass and some understanding of how society works, how democracies work.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At home in Cambridge, with his new book, ''Liberal Education and the Public Interest'' (University of Iowa Press, 2003), an ode to the value of liberal education, on the coffee table in front of him, Mr. Freedman makes his case with passion. Contrary to what critics might say, when it comes to getting a job in today's economy, Mr. Freedman says a liberal education is an important advantage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''A liberal education is what teaches people how to write and how to think and makes them much more valuable in the job market over a 40-year career than graduates of a preprofessional program,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''All the employers will tell you that they're seeking the flexibility of mind that a liberal education imbues.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His book came out in January, as he was battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system. The chemotherapy he has been undergoing since September is working.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the fall, with a tumor pressing against the nerves of his lower back, he was using a wheelchair. Now, he needs only a cane to navigate the stairs of the Victorian home he shares with his wife, Sheba.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is Mr. Freedman's fourth bout with cancer since 1994, and just as he writes in his book that a liberal education enables us to see life more clearly, so has he looked clearly at his illness. The odds are that it will return again in a year, he says, and while he hopes to watch his three small grandchildren grow up, he says, there is no way of knowing just how many years he has.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is focusing, as ever, on writing, and speaking out for the liberal values that he has spent his lifetime working for and that he now sees eroding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Life is what we are doing now,'' he writes in his book, reflecting upon the importance of an early commitment to the values of liberal arts, equal education, idealism and public service.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his desk upstairs are a thousand pages of his fourth book: a memoir that moves from his growing up as the son of a high school English teacher in Manchester, N.H., to his undergraduate days at Harvard, where, he says, he was too timid and conventional to be a brilliant student, and on to Yale Law School, where he blossomed intellectually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The book ends at age 27, when he was a law clerk for Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, one of his heroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman put his knowledge of the law to use recently, when, as a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, he helped prepare a brief for the United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The future of America depends on educating minority men and women,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his 11 years as president of Dartmouth, Mr. Freedman devoted himself to making the college welcoming to what he called the creative loners, cellists, poets and mathematicians, as well as athletes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also carved out a role as a public intellectual, standing up to a group of right-wing students -- and their prominent, adult benefactors -- who were ridiculing blacks, homosexuals, women and Jews on campus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making their views known through the neoconservative, off-campus Dartmouth Review, the students ran a front page cartoon that showed Mr. Freedman, who is Jewish, dressed like Adolf Hitler. Eventually, tolerance and civility were restored.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last September, concerned by news reports that Jewish students were being intimidated on campuses amid protests over the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Freedman helped collect signatures from 310 college presidents for a statement calling for ''intimidation-free'' campuses. Some presidents criticized the statement for focusing only on Jewish students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With heavy snow falling on the streets of Cambridge, Mr. Freedman was relaxing in his living room, with Sheba, his wife of nearly 40 years, across from him. They were surrounded by some of Mr. Freedman's 2,000 favorite books, by T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, Saul Bellow, Faulkner, Joyce.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lifelong book collector, Mr. Freedman reluctantly parted with 4,000 other favorites when he left Dartmouth -- and the library at the president's house -- for Cambridge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward evening, the doorbell rang. Howard Gardner, the Harvard educational psychologist who is one of Mr. Freedman's closest friends, came in from the snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In retirement, as an elder statesman of academia, Mr. Freedman's advice is sought frequently. Professor Gardner wanted to consult with him about three academics who needed jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman is ''the ultimate search engine,'' Professor Gardner said, ''because he knows so many people, in so many ways, heart, mind, spirit.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Life is unpredictable and full of disappointment, Mr. Freedman writes in his book, the breakup of marriages, death of loved ones, enduring illness. In such a world, he writes, ''how ought one to lead a life?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''That is one of the questions that a liberal education addresses,'' he writes. ''The most effective protection against the contingencies of experience are values that appeal to our very best natures and anchor us most securely in the ocean of fate.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are the kinds of subjects Dr. Donald Kaufman, one of Mr. Freedman's oncologists, says he enjoys discussing with the former college president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''I always reserve 30 minutes for his visits,'' Dr. Kaufman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''They go on for 90. This is for my benefit, not his. He's teaching me what it means to be a patient. He's teaching people how to live.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James O.

Between 2001 and 2012, the number of African-American engineering faculty members increased to 3 percent from 2 percent. In all, in 2012 there were only 140 African-American women working as engineering professors \u2014 out of some 24,640 across the entire field (not including computer engineering).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For me, this statistical desert is made even more stark by the fact that, at a private school in a Midwestern town like mine, students may have interacted with African-Americans only in the service industry, or in high school, with female teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I decided to become an engineering professor 20 years ago while sitting in class and realizing that I had never had a professor who looked like me, acted like me or even seemed interested in me.

The 1957 attempt by the Arkansas governor Orval Faubus to block Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School led to threats of violence against the federal judge who enforced the court\u2019s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. That judge, Ronald N. Davies, was \u201cuncowed,\u201d the chief justice wrote, despite being \u201cphysically threatened.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cA judicial system cannot and should not live in fear,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts added as he thanked Congress for passing a law last year to protect judges. The new law was named in honor of Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, who was murdered in 2020 in an assault meant for the judge at her home. The law screens from the public the personal information of federal judges and their families, including identifiers such as license plate numbers and addresses. Leaders like the chief justice deserve praise when they highlight the dangers all public officials now face.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Focusing on the Brown decision was nonetheless surprising. After all, the court appears poised to reverse a decision upholding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in school admissions, one of the very remedies that the Brown decision spawned, and which all nine members of the court stood squarely behind in 1954 and reaffirmed in a subsequent case in 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, the chief justice sometimes used his year-end report to describe substantive reforms in the federal courts, like the task force created in 2018 in response to allegations that federal judges had harassed their staffs sexually and in other ways. Not so in his latest report, which was four pages long with a five-page appendix. Chief Justice Roberts did not mention any of the many issues that made the news about the court last year \u2014 the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices whose actions or those of family members raise questions about impartiality, the leak of a draft of the court\u2019s decision overturning abortion rights, the insufficiency of financial disclosure and questions about fund-raising for the Supreme Court Historical Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor did the chief justice explore the troubling data in his report\u2019s appendix on \u201cthe workload of the courts.\u201d The numbers document a sharp decline of the use of the federal courts. Federal appellate filings fell again in the fiscal year 2022, a steady decline from 49,000 in 2018 to fewer than 42,000 last year. Trial-level civil cases in the federal district courts have fallen precipitously as well \u2014 down from more almost 283,000 cases in 2018 to about 240,000 in 2022.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In calculating totals and the trend in civil cases, court administrators did not include about 321,000 filings that, starting in 2020, were brought by military service members and veterans who claimed that combat earplugs sold by 3M to the U.S. military were faulty. Under a federal statute, those cases became, in effect, one litigation, consolidated before trial in front of a single judge, and they are an example of the importance of people having access to courts, which can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The opinions of the very court that the chief justice leads provide insight into the decline. We know from our own experience that savvy civil rights lawyers now steer clear of federal court. Winning in the appellate courts risks having the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority extinguish any gains won for women, prisoners, the environment and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dwindling numbers of filings at the trial level in the U.S. District Courts also derive in part from what the Supreme Court has done during the last few decades \u2014 to close the courthouse doors to many would-be litigants, in class-action lawsuits and other cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key example can be found in the court\u2019s interpretations of the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In a series of cases that began in the 1980s, the court has read the statute to mean that employers and businesses can include arbitration clauses in lengthy, dense, fine-print documents with consumers and employees that bar access to courts and to class actions. Even complaints of violations of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and of federal laws regulating securities, fair credit, unlawful mergers and unfair business practices can be forced into arbitration rather than being litigated in court. Anyone aggrieved has to go, one by one, to private arbitration. In practice, almost none do, because most people don\u2019t have the resources to pursue small-value claims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, the veterans in the combat earplug cases were able to get into court because no arbitration mandate kept them out. And once in court, because of procedures designed to make group-based litigation easier, they could combine resources to pursue their arguments of hearing loss and tinnitus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The \u201cstate of the judiciary\u201d address is a bully pulpit constructed decades ago by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Given the challenges the country faces, we need a chief justice who helps us all talk seriously about what ails the federal courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s focus on 1950s desegregation litigation is a poignant reminder that once federal courts led the way in protecting civil rights and making courts accessible to all. His court, however, has made plain it has no interest in opening doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that, we need Congress to reinvigorate federal rights and end the power of would-be defendants to control access. That\u2019s what Congress did in 2022 when it amended the 1925 arbitration statute to let victims of sexual assault and harassment decide if they want to sue in court rather than consider using arbitration. The chief justice properly commended Congress for making strides in protecting federal judges. Now Congress needs to protect and support the right to bring cases to those judges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nancy Gertner, a retired Federal District Court judge, is a senior lecturer in law at Harvard Law School.

Trial-level civil cases in the federal district courts have fallen precipitously as well \u2014 down from more almost 283,000 cases in 2018 to about 240,000 in 2022.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In calculating totals and the trend in civil cases, court administrators did not include about 321,000 filings that, starting in 2020, were brought by military service members and veterans who claimed that combat earplugs sold by 3M to the U.S. military were faulty. Under a federal statute, those cases became, in effect, one litigation, consolidated before trial in front of a single judge, and they are an example of the importance of people having access to courts, which can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The opinions of the very court that the chief justice leads provide insight into the decline. We know from our own experience that savvy civil rights lawyers now steer clear of federal court. Winning in the appellate courts risks having the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority extinguish any gains won for women, prisoners, the environment and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dwindling numbers of filings at the trial level in the U.S. District Courts also derive in part from what the Supreme Court has done during the last few decades \u2014 to close the courthouse doors to many would-be litigants, in class-action lawsuits and other cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key example can be found in the court\u2019s interpretations of the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In a series of cases that began in the 1980s, the court has read the statute to mean that employers and businesses can include arbitration clauses in lengthy, dense, fine-print documents with consumers and employees that bar access to courts and to class actions. Even complaints of violations of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and of federal laws regulating securities, fair credit, unlawful mergers and unfair business practices can be forced into arbitration rather than being litigated in court. Anyone aggrieved has to go, one by one, to private arbitration. In practice, almost none do, because most people don\u2019t have the resources to pursue small-value claims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, the veterans in the combat earplug cases were able to get into court because no arbitration mandate kept them out. And once in court, because of procedures designed to make group-based litigation easier, they could combine resources to pursue their arguments of hearing loss and tinnitus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The \u201cstate of the judiciary\u201d address is a bully pulpit constructed decades ago by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Given the challenges the country faces, we need a chief justice who helps us all talk seriously about what ails the federal courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s focus on 1950s desegregation litigation is a poignant reminder that once federal courts led the way in protecting civil rights and making courts accessible to all. His court, however, has made plain it has no interest in opening doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that, we need Congress to reinvigorate federal rights and end the power of would-be defendants to control access. That\u2019s what Congress did in 2022 when it amended the 1925 arbitration statute to let victims of sexual assault and harassment decide if they want to sue in court rather than consider using arbitration. The chief justice properly commended Congress for making strides in protecting federal judges. Now Congress needs to protect and support the right to bring cases to those judges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nancy Gertner, a retired Federal District Court judge, is a senior lecturer in law at Harvard Law School.

But given the tenor of the Court's recent decisions on racial preferences, the Administration has made a smart strategic move to preserve what can and should be saved of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case concerns the decision of the Piscataway, N.J., school board to promote racial diversity by laying off a white teacher so that it could preserve the job of an equally qualified black teacher. Though the Administration had previously supported the school board, the brief it filed with the Supreme Court on Aug. 23 concedes that the board violated the civil rights of the white teacher.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In previous rulings, the Court has maintained that government use of racial preferences is constitutional only when such action is necessary to remedy a history of overt discrimination, or when the public goal being pursued is ''compelling.'' Moreover, the Court has said, the use of racial preferences must be ''narrowly tailored'' to meet the particular goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appellate court that heard the Piscataway case declared, in effect, that racial diversity could never be a compelling state interest. Should the Supreme Court completely uphold the appellate court's ruling, the use of race in decisions about hiring and firing public employees could, for all practical purposes, be prohibited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Piscataway case, the avowed goal -- racial diversity within a single, small department of an otherwise diverse faculty -- does not seem ''compelling.'' And the way the school board chose to pursue its goal of diversity -- dismissing a white teacher solely because of her race -- was not ''narrowly tailored.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By acknowledging this, yet at the same time making a broader argument for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, the Administration hopes to preserve some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring. The approach it has suggested in its brief is essentially a compromise. Even if the Piscataway school board was wrong in this specific instance in its use of racial preference, the Administration argues, there is still a place for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and not only to remedy past discrimination. Indeed, as it points out in its brief, there are times when taking race into account is the only way to further compelling public goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A police department, for example, may need to recruit a diverse officer corps to carry on effective undercover work or to retain public confidence in neighborhoods where there are racial tensions.

But given the tenor of the Court's recent decisions on racial preferences, the Administration has made a smart strategic move to preserve what can and should be saved of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case concerns the decision of the Piscataway, N.J., school board to promote racial diversity by laying off a white teacher so that it could preserve the job of an equally qualified black teacher. Though the Administration had previously supported the school board, the brief it filed with the Supreme Court on Aug. 23 concedes that the board violated the civil rights of the white teacher.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In previous rulings, the Court has maintained that government use of racial preferences is constitutional only when such action is necessary to remedy a history of overt discrimination, or when the public goal being pursued is ''compelling.'' Moreover, the Court has said, the use of racial preferences must be ''narrowly tailored'' to meet the particular goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appellate court that heard the Piscataway case declared, in effect, that racial diversity could never be a compelling state interest. Should the Supreme Court completely uphold the appellate court's ruling, the use of race in decisions about hiring and firing public employees could, for all practical purposes, be prohibited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Piscataway case, the avowed goal -- racial diversity within a single, small department of an otherwise diverse faculty -- does not seem ''compelling.'' And the way the school board chose to pursue its goal of diversity -- dismissing a white teacher solely because of her race -- was not ''narrowly tailored.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By acknowledging this, yet at the same time making a broader argument for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, the Administration hopes to preserve some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring. The approach it has suggested in its brief is essentially a compromise. Even if the Piscataway school board was wrong in this specific instance in its use of racial preference, the Administration argues, there is still a place for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and not only to remedy past discrimination. Indeed, as it points out in its brief, there are times when taking race into account is the only way to further compelling public goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A police department, for example, may need to recruit a diverse officer corps to carry on effective undercover work or to retain public confidence in neighborhoods where there are racial tensions. At schools and colleges, a diverse faculty may, through the example of its own collegiality, teach students important lessons about working across racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the absolutist opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> have the upper hand, in the courts as well as in the broader public debate.
