But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative.

One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This view is wrong \u2014 the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard\u2019s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard\u2019s tenured professors are white \u2014 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and most recently \u201ckung flu.\u201d Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never \u201cleveled the playing field,\u201d but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Op-Ed: Why California needs affirmative action more than ever</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In November, a new generation of California voters will have the opportunity to restore <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in the state.

And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard\u2019s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard\u2019s tenured professors are white \u2014 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and most recently \u201ckung flu.\u201d Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never \u201cleveled the playing field,\u201d but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2761519572.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2761519572.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>What Went Unsaid in the Chief Justice\u2019s Report on the Judiciary</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, recently filed his 2022 \u201cyear-end report on the federal judiciary.\u201d It\u2019s more interesting for what it didn\u2019t say than for what it did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To underscore the threatening world that judges occupy, the chief justice began by focusing on a pivotal moment in the desegregation of the nation\u2019s schools.

The law screens from the public the personal information of federal judges and their families, including identifiers such as license plate numbers and addresses. Leaders like the chief justice deserve praise when they highlight the dangers all public officials now face.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Focusing on the Brown decision was nonetheless surprising.

Chief Justice Roberts did not mention any of the many issues that made the news about the court last year \u2014 the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices whose actions or those of family members raise questions about impartiality, the leak of a draft of the court\u2019s decision overturning abortion rights, the insufficiency of financial disclosure and questions about fund-raising for the Supreme Court Historical Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor did the chief justice explore the troubling data in his report\u2019s appendix on \u201cthe workload of the courts.\u201d The numbers document a sharp decline of the use of the federal courts. Federal appellate filings fell again in the fiscal year 2022, a steady decline from 49,000 in 2018 to fewer than 42,000 last year. Trial-level civil cases in the federal district courts have fallen precipitously as well \u2014 down from more almost 283,000 cases in 2018 to about 240,000 in 2022.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In calculating totals and the trend in civil cases, court administrators did not include about 321,000 filings that, starting in 2020, were brought by military service members and veterans who claimed that combat earplugs sold by 3M to the U.S. military were faulty. Under a federal statute, those cases became, in effect, one litigation, consolidated before trial in front of a single judge, and they are an example of the importance of people having access to courts, which can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The opinions of the very court that the chief justice leads provide insight into the decline. We know from our own experience that savvy civil rights lawyers now steer clear of federal court.

In a series of cases that began in the 1980s, the court has read the statute to mean that employers and businesses can include arbitration clauses in lengthy, dense, fine-print documents with consumers and employees that bar access to courts and to class actions. Even complaints of violations of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and of federal laws regulating securities, fair credit, unlawful mergers and unfair business practices can be forced into arbitration rather than being litigated in court.

Martin Luther King Jr. almost 34 years ago, have been both a blessing and a curse. To many, they are a beacon still calling to the country. To others, they have indelibly tagged King as a hopeless utopian with lofty visions of ending war, racism and poverty, but with no concrete program to achieve these aims. No wonder the man we celebrate today has practically been turned into a harmless, badly outdated icon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he isn't. In a work largely ignored when it was published 30 years ago and all but unknown today, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?,\" King turned from dreamer to problem solver. But before we look at those ideas, there are two huge caveats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, recasting the words of a historic figure to fit present situations must be avoided. This type of dangerous ideological revisionism was shamefully evident in the contentious debate over Proposition 209 in California. Both sides exploited and deliberately distorted the few stray remarks that King uttered on what is known today as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, a concept just beginning to take shape in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second caveat is that King can't be fitted into a neat ideological box. There is enough paradox and ambivalence in King's positions for liberals and conservatives to praise and damn. At various times, he railed against and embraced black militants. He applauded violent anti-colonial and national liberation movements and championed nonviolent change. Paradox and ambivalence also marked his private life. As a man of God, his moral lashing of America was wildly at odds with his questionable sexual conduct. Not surprisingly, King's solutions to many of the big-ticket racial and class problems that plagued America were a mix of idealism and pragmatism, which people faulted for lacking a clear direction. King can't be blamed for that. Three decades after his death, America is still no closer to solving these problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* The black family crisis. King branded the black family \"fragile, deprived and often psychopathic.\" While he could have been criticized for giving weight to negative myths and stereotypes about black families, King was correct in targeting father absenteeism in the black home as a major ill. He made the standard liberal call for more government-funded job, education and skills training programs. But he also recognized the importance of values like training, discipline, hard work and the reduction of family violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Educational neglect. King did not believe that more funds, smaller classrooms and better textbooks alone would solve the crisis of the classroom. He called on teachers and administrators to rededicate themselves to the ideal of quality education, and for parents to get more involved in their children's education. King's proposal for \"educational parks,\" a kind of multifaceted complex for teaching basic skills as well as advanced studies, anticipated the idea of magnet schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Political apathy. Exercising the right to vote and electing blacks were not enough for King. He challenged black officeholders to be \"independent and assertive\" in fighting for legislation to improve the plight of the black poor and for black organizations to build political alliances with labor and other ethnic groups based on the needs and interests they have in common.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Corporate racism. The campaign against discrimination in hiring and promotions that followed the Texaco scandal closely followed a four-step plan outlined by King. It included more jobs and promotions, selected buying campaigns, boycotts and organized protests, negotiations and the monitoring of any agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Economic empowerment. King often quipped that it was futile to integrate a lunch counter if blacks couldn't afford to buy a meal. He demanded huge increases in federal funding for job and skills training programs. But he also recognized that government couldn't or shouldn't be expected to do it all. He called for \"black dollar days\" in which blacks purchased goods and services from black businesses and deposited their savings in black-owned banks. In turn, King expected black entrepreneurs to recycle those dollars into education, recreation and social programs for the black poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Crime and violence. King understood that the destructive cycle of drugs, crime and violence destabilized black communities. While his first priority was, as always, more government-funded job and education programs, he also stressed family values, personal responsibility and discipline. He urged black professionals to give more of their time and money to employment, educational and recreational programs aimed at \"saving\" at-risk black youth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Welfare. King agreed that reliance on welfare could breed dependency and discourage personal initiative. He proposed that the government provide direct tax subsidies and tax incentives to corporations to hire and train unskilled workers. This idea was a forerunner of today's federally backed enterprise and empowerment zones. He also called for the creation of \"second chance universities\" to train welfare recipients and the unemployed to compete in the technological job market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By today's standards, King's agenda may seem piecemeal and patchwork. Almost all of his ideas have been either implemented, tried and discarded or discredited. But so what? King didn't just dream of a new world, he died fighting for it.

The task is to expose the court's disintegration as a legitimate judicial body and note its emergence as a supreme right-wing policymaker.

It has become a crutch whenever the court seeks to invalidate a program it doesn't like.

Richard Barrett, whose Nationalist Movement oath declares ''the white race is the superlative civilizer,'' said he chose Morristown because of its history. Just as George Washington ''said no to the privileges of the king, today we're saying no to the privileges of minorities,'' he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett got what he wanted yesterday -- helmeted police protecting his right to march on Washington Street, a crowd of angry counter-protesters that drew pepper spray and 10 arrests.

About 1,000 people filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't have done it without him.

''It always is.''</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>A Lesson In Bigotry And Liberty</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THIS town, which served as a headquarters of the Revolutionary Army, usually celebrates the Fourth of July with a dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence, complete with muskets and tricorn hats. But this year, Morristown also had a live-action drama showcasing those unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The action began when a white supremacist from Mississippi won the right in court to hold a rally here yesterday. Richard Barrett, whose Nationalist Movement oath declares ''the white race is the superlative civilizer,'' said he chose Morristown because of its history. Just as George Washington ''said no to the privileges of the king, today we're saying no to the privileges of minorities,'' he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett got what he wanted yesterday -- helmeted police protecting his right to march on Washington Street, a crowd of angry counter-protesters that drew pepper spray and 10 arrests. A perfect forum for a man with bullhorn and bombast. Mr. Barrett brought to town an anemic anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> protest and a racist version of the Declaration of Independence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But on Monday night, as Mr. Barrett prepared to deliver his divisive message, Morristown made its elegant statement. About 1,000 people filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't have done it without him.
