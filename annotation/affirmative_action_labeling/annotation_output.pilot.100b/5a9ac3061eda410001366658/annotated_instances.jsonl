{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1987023512.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>The Heartbeat of Racism Is Denial</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When our reality is too ugly, we deny reality. It is too painful to look at. Reality is too hard to accept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mental health experts routinely say that denial is among the most common defense mechanisms. Denial is how the person defends his superior sense of self, her racially unequal society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Denial is how America defends itself as superior to \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa and elsewhere, as President Trump reportedly described them in a White House meeting last week, although he has since, well, denied that. It\u2019s also how America defends itself as superior to those \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d in Africa, to quote how liberal opponents of Mr. Trump might often describe them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump appears to be unifying America \u2014 unifying Americans in their denial. The more racist Mr. Trump sounds, the more Trump country denies his racism, and the more his opponents look away from their own racism to brand Trump country as racist. Through it all, America remains a unified country of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reckoning of Mr. Trump\u2019s racism must become the reckoning of American racism. Because the American creed of denial \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not a racist\u201d \u2014 knows no political parties, no ideologies, no colors, no regions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, affirmed that Mr. Trump did use the term \u201cshithole\u201d during a White House meeting on immigration with lawmakers. Mr. Durbin rightfully described Mr. Trump\u2019s words as \u201chate-filled, vile and racist,\u201d and added, \u201cI cannot believe that in the history of the White House in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Trump is no exception. In framing Mr. Trump\u2019s racism as exceptional, in seeking to highlight the depth of the president\u2019s cruelty, Mr. Durbin, a reliably liberal senator, showed the depth of denial of American racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Begin with the eight presidents who held slaves while in the Oval Office. Then consider how Abraham Lincoln urged black people to leave the United States. \u201cEven when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race,\u201d Lincoln told five black guests at the White House in 1862. So \u201cit is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raging then as we are raging now, the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison responded, \u201cCan anything be more puerile, absurd, illogical, impertinent, untimely?\u201d He added that \u201chad it not been for the cupidity of their white enslavers, not one of their race would now be found upon this continent.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Presidential history also includes the social Darwinism of Theodore Roosevelt, the federal-government-segregating, \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d-praising Woodrow Wilson \u2014 and the bigotry that came from the mouths of presidents who are generally seen as essential to racial progress. President Lyndon B. Johnson said \u201cnigger\u201d nearly as often as Ku Klux Klansmen did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism. Where there is suffering from racist policies, there are denials that those policies are racist. The beat of denial sounds the same across time and space.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up to the beat of racist denial in Queens, not far from where Mr. Trump grew up. I was raised in the urban \u201chell\u201d of neighborhoods he probably avoided, alongside immigrants from countries he derided last week. In school or elsewhere, we all heard recitals of the American ideal of equality, especially on the day we celebrate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Those events often feature recitals of the words \u201call men are created equal,\u201d which were written by a slaveholder who once declared that black people \u201care inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thomas Jefferson was not a founding father of equality. He was a founding father of the heartbeat of denial that lives through both Mr. Trump\u2019s denials and the assertion that his racial views are abnormal for America and its presidents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fifty years ago, Richard Nixon transformed this historic heartbeat of denial into an intoxicating political philosophy. His presidential candidacy appealed to George Wallace-type segregationists while also attracting Americans who refused to live near \u201cdangerous\u201d black residents, obstructed the desegregation of schools, resisted <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies, framed black mothers on welfare as undeserving, called the black family pathological and denigrated black culture \u2014 all those racists who refused to believe they were racist in 1968.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nixon designed his campaign, one of his advisers explained, to allow a potential supporter to \u201cavoid admitting to himself that he was attracted by\u201d the \u201cracist appeal.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new vocabulary emerged, allowing users to evade admissions of racism. It still holds fast after all these years. The vocabulary list includes these: law and order. War on drugs. Model minority. Reverse discrimination. Race-neutral. Welfare queen. Handout. Tough on crime. Personal responsibility. Black-on-black crime. Achievement gap. No excuses. Race card. Colorblind. Post-racial. Illegal immigrant. Obamacare. War on Cops. Blue Lives Matter. All Lives Matter. Entitlements. Voter fraud. Economic anxiety.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The denials using these phrases come from both conservatives and white liberals who think people of color are stuck in cycles of unstable families and criminal cultures, and that the deprivations of poverty and discrimination spin out bad people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump opened his candidacy with racism, calling Mexicans criminals and rapists. Since taking office, he has looked away from the disaster zone in Puerto Rico, he has called some violent white supremacists \u201cvery fine people,\u201d and he has described Nigerians as living in \u201chuts .\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When someone identifies the obvious, Mr. Trump resounds the beat of denial as he did before he was president: \u201cI\u2019m the least racist person that you\u2019ve ever met ,\u201d that \u201cyou\u2019ve ever seen ,\u201d that \u201cyou\u2019ve ever encountered .\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are ugly denials. But it\u2019s the denials from those who stand in strong opposition to this president that are more frustrating to me: denials that their attacks on identity politics are racist. Denials that the paltry number of people of color in elite spaces marks racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those denials echo the same ones that frustrated Dr. King in 1963 as he sat in a Birmingham jail cell and wrote , \u201cShallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, I suspect, will go to his grave with his heart beating in denial of the ill will of racism. Many others will as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because we naturally want to look away from our ugliness. We paint over racist reality to make a beautiful delusion of self, of society. We defend this beautiful self and society from our racist reality with the weapons of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Denial is fueled by the stigma associated with being a racist. Feeding the stigma is how \u201cracist\u201d is considered almost like an identity, a brand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a racist is not who a person is. A racist is what a person is, what a person is saying, what a person is doing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Racist is not a fixed category like \u201cnot racist,\u201d which is steeped denial. Only racists say they are not racist. Only the racist lives by the heartbeat of denial.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The antiracist lives by the opposite heartbeat, one that rarely and irregularly sounds in America \u2014 the heartbeat of confession.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/opinion/sunday/heartbeat-of-racism-denial.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: IBRAM X.

But this gives them too much credit. It implies they have a starting team. Not these days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bench is where players are stashed who can step in for the first team--for a governor, a U.S. senator, a state attorney general. . . . The GOP currently has none of these top positions. Democrats occupy the governor's office, both U.S. Senate seats and five of seven statewide partisan offices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of two statewide elected Republicans--Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush--has suffered a potential career-ending scandal. Scratch him as a future governor. The other--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Secretary of State Bill Jones--angered major GOP campaign contributors by defecting to Sen. John McCain after having committed to Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Jones is now on the political disabled list.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is one healthy player, and he's not exactly a bench warmer. He's the new state Senate minority leader, Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte, 44, is the most politically savvy, articulate Republican in the Legislature. Indeed, it's tough to think of a Republican throughout California who commands more respect among politicians of either party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He makes things happen in the Capitol,\" notes GOP consultant Ray McNally. \"And he does it without surrendering his conservative principles. Without selling out.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte's first political job was slapping on bumper strips for gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan as a 10-year-old. Eventually, he became an advance man for Vice President George Bush, worked for several politicians and was elected to the Assembly in 1990.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Quickly rising to Republican leader, Brulte orchestrated the GOP's \"takeover\" of the Assembly in 1994. But three Republicans sold out to Democrat Willie Brown and Brulte was denied the speakership. In 1996, he moved to the Senate, became GOP caucus chairman and, when Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine stepped down as minority leader for family health reasons last week, Brulte succeeded him without a fight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's now his responsibility to improve the GOP's 25-15 disadvantage in the Senate--or at least keep the scarce seats the party holds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What drives Brulte is political conquest and legislative compromise, not any ideological cause. He brings to the arena congeniality. \"I don't provoke people,\" notes the 6-foot, 4-inch, 260- pound GOP leader.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That means less legislative gridlock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's not one to hang up a budget over, say, abortion funding. In truth, no recent GOP leader has, partly due to Brulte's coaxing. He's basically antiabortion but tries to avoid the divisive issue. Same with gun control; he mostly votes against it, but cautions Republicans that they are on the wrong side of history on firearms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked how his party got to this low point, Brulte replies: \"It allowed itself to be painted as intolerant. It picked issues that tended to divide rather than to unite. And we're now [in the Senate] trying to focus on issues that unite.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Issues like school accountability, lower college fees, transportation planning. He won't get into the errant, divisive issues--abortion, illegal immigration, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte has his own <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program: He pumped $400,000 from his political kitty into the winning primary campaigns of Republican women and minorities. \"I wanted to send a signal that at the highest level of the party, we're prepared to put our money where our mouth is,\" he says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An optimist, Brulte professes not to worry about the GOP's future in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Conventional wisdom is historically wrong,\" he says. \"Three years ago, Gray Davis was pretty much derided. Today he's governor. . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Perception always trails reality. And the Republican Party was in trouble long before people recognized it. We're still in trouble, but we're better off than people think.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The party is financially better off since Brulte became its finance chairman last fall. It was $300,000 in debt; now it has more than $1 million in the bank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Considered Bush's point man in California, Brulte recruited the candidate for a $2-million-plus party fund-raising dinner. This week, Bush is in California again raising another $2 million for the state and national parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Says Gov. Davis' chief strategist, Garry South: \"I think the world of Brulte. We're honest with each other. He's never sleazed me. I pick his brain. He picks mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"My only concern about Brulte is he's had such a meteoric rise, he's going to think the next step is running for governor.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not likely. But given their bench, Republicans could do worse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Message No: ..ACCN: 00042160</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: GRAPHIC-DRAWING: SACRAMENTO</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 15s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/408321836.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>The Power Ignored by the Press</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thirty years ago there was a flurry of interest by the press in the activities of America's nonprofit, tax-exempt foundations. Some, we discovered, acted as conduits for CIA subsidies to civic and educational organizations and subsidized the publication of various books and magazines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was all part of the Cold War against the Soviet Union, although many recipients of the agency's cash didn't know that and didn't know their patron. Not much came from these disclosures. The parties promised to sin no more and before long, the affair had faded into the misty regions of memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media turned to other pursuits and today, as Nicholas Lemann writes in the Atlantic Monthly, \"The press, which pays close attention to politics and government through deeply ingrained reflex, largely ignores foundations, or treats them, in a polite but faintly bored tone, as innocuous do-gooders rather than significant actors.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our interest in these institutions flickered briefly a couple of years ago when conservative elements in Congress started asking questions and proposing legislation to curb the political activities of foundations and the thousands of tax-exempt special interest groups that have spread like kudzu during the past 25 years. They now occupy a respectable share of the available office space in Washington. The \"public interests\" they represent range from the World Association of Alcohol Beverage Industries and the Dairy Recognition Foundation to the League of Women Voters and the YMCA.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax exemption, as Lemann reminds us, is granted to foundations and their \"public interest\" cousins on condition that they forswear any \"attempt to influence political or legislative outcomes, except by providing technical information. This rule is violated widely. In fact, it's difficult to think of a significant policy initiative taken by the federal government or voiced in a recent presidential campaign that didn't have some foundation undergirding.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is complicated by the federal government, which provides funding to many politically active nonprofits -- the National Council of Senior Citizens, for example -- that administer various federal educational and job-training programs. Republican critics in Congress claim that through bookkeeping devices these federal grants can be misused to finance political activities. They lost the fight last year, and the subject has more or less vanished from media agendas. That is unfortunate because foundations and the \"public interest\" nonprofits are a big, influential and expanding industry. Lemann reports that during the past 15 years or so the number of foundations has nearly doubled, from 22,000 to 39,000. Their assets now exceed $200 billion, half of it controlled by fewer than 200 foundations, according to another student of the industry, Alan Reynolds of the Hudson Institute.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This wealth, he writes, represents \"enormous influence over which public policy, social program or artistic endeavor will succeed or fail.\" Lemann makes a similar point. Big foundations, \"which have a distinctly liberal cast use their tax-exempt dollars to fund everything from the civil rights movement to studies supporting the expansion of the welfare state to disarmament and population control abroad.\" As conservative foundations have prospered since 1980 they \"have been particularly successful in training cadres of activists and policymakers to serve their cause, by subsidizing books that change the tenor of public discourse (for example, Dinesh D'Souza's `Illiberal Education') and supplying the government with policy ideas (the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for the early Reagan Administration . . . ).\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reach of the foundations is felt in ostensibly private affairs as well. Peter Skerry, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, recalls in the Wilson Quarterly the 1994 upheaval within the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The incumbent executive director, Benjamin Chavis, was ousted. \"But it was seldom noted {in the press},\" Skerry observes, \"that his removal was instigated not by the membership but by the Ford Foundation, which withheld a major grant until the NAACP's finances were put in order. One of the few observers who did note it was Washington Post columnist William Raspberry {who asked} . . . how such a venerable organization, still 600,000 members strong, has come to the point . . . of being beholden to a private foundation for its survival?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foundations may even work through relatively hollow organizational fronts. Skerry cites the case of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) \"which seeks to represent not only all Mexican Americans but all of the nation's 27 million Latinos. This claim is widely accepted, and the organization has played a prominent role in recent debates over immigration and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Yet it has no members and gets most of its funding from corporations and foundations, especially the Ford Foundation, which played the critical role in establishing it in the late 1960s. Lacking members, MALDEF has no real bonds of accountability to the communities it strives to represent.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Kettering Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia foundation, are less well-known than the Ford or Rockefeller foundations. But they have had a significant impact on a number of nongovernmental institutions, including the American press. Their intellectual leadership and money have been largely responsible for the \"civic journalism\" movement that has been taken up by the media in more than 40 cities. The guiding principle of \"civic journalism\" is that the public, through polls and \"focus groups\" usually financed by the foundations, should play an important role in setting the news and editorial agendas of the press. Newspapers and broadcasters that have embraced the movement are generally pleased with the results.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many critics such as William Woo, former editor of the St. Louis Post Dispatch, believe the press risks its independence and credibility by aligning itself and becoming financially beholden to foundations with \"a very ideological view of America, a very definite view of the road America should take.\" He puts Pew in that category.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Lemann, the broader problem is that foundations \"have no voters, no customers, no investors.\" So they operate in an unexamined environment, ignored by the press and public alike. No one asks the \"main policy questions about them -- How, exactly, should their economic and political activities be restricted in return for their tax-exempt status? Does the tax exemption still make sense ?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This {isolation} ought to change. Foundations are becoming so much more significant so rapidly that they deserve to be brought into the company of central institutions whose course is the subject of constant public scrutiny and debate.\"</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 47s "}}

Neglectful landlords. Battles over minority enrollment. In the imagination of many liberal New Yorkers, private universities like New York and Columbia are often at odds with struggling communities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's Dr. Allan J. Formicola to contradict the usual image. Retiring this month after 23 years as dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, Dr. Formicola, 61, used his position to attract minorities to the dental school and to bring high-quality dental care to Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Formicola, a man with two wings of curly salt-and-pepper hair and a warm  manner, achieved this partly through a personality that makes him as comfortable in a boardroom as on a street corner. He reached out to minority alumni, some of whom had felt isolated at the dental school. At a time of falling enrollment at dental schools nationally, he sold Columbia on encouraging new black and brown faces and more local involvement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The grandson of Italian immigrants, Dr. Formicola was only 38 when he arrived at Columbia in 1978. But his resume included a stint in the late 60's teaching at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a city infamous for its treatment of black people. He describes himself as someone who was always enamored of the ideals of the Great Society and the civil rights movement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''He's got a tremendous amount of respect from the people in Harlem,'' said Paul Dunn, vice president of Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement. ''He's a man who's had a lot of vision and a lot of commitment to bringing people together and building bridges.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia and Harlem, in particular, have had a fractious relationship. Most famously, the 1968 student protest was sparked by Columbia's plan to build a gym in Morningside Park. Recently, Columbia's Morningside Heights neighbors took the university to court over plans to build faculty housing and an elementary school on West 110th Street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dental school, founded in 1852 and incorporated into Columbia in 1917, had its own history, mostly of indifference. Only 13 blacks graduated from the the school between 1923 and 1980. Dr. Formicola helped enhance minority enrollment to the point that out of a student body of about 300, each class has 6 to 10 blacks and 6 to 8 Latinos. Also under his guidance, Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood now have three community health centers, dental clinics in seven neighborhood schools, and a van offering dental care to children and the aged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Formicola's achievements are an implicit answer to a question behind the never-ending debate about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and other issues involving inequality: what do those in power owe those on the other end?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''It's hard to say when you're sitting in the midst of a community in need that our mission should be research and education,'' Dr. Formicola said as he sat in his immaculate office in Washington Heights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia's dental school now leads the nation in projects like community partnerships for clinics, said Dennis Mitchell-Lewis, an assistant professor at the school and the director of many of the outreach efforts. ''Dean Formicola has changed everything,'' Dr. Mitchell-Lewis said. ''He added community service to the mission of the dental school. He has a unique way with people. I've had him on 127th Street at 7:30 p.m, meeting with 14 women from a women's group from a little church.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Albert Thompson, a black graduate now in private practice in Manhattan, was one who answered Dr. Formicola's call in 1978 to help recruit minority students, faculty and administrators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all the attention paid to drawing minorities into the professions, fewer than 5  percent of American dentists are black. And yet minority graduates are more likely to go to work in minority neighborhoods, where inadequate dental care remains a problem, resulting in everything from children with excessive cavities to disparities between white and nonwhite survivors of oral cancers. There are still no pediatric dentists or oral surgeons in private practice in Harlem, Dr. Mitchell-Lewis said, even as research shows a link between oral health and heart disease, diabetes and premature babies. ''We are still at the beginning,'' he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question now is whether the successes achieved under Dr. Formicola will continue.

It's an experiment providing a \"universal basic income,\" or UBI, to low-income Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In conjunction with the Marin Community Foundation, which plans to contribute $3 million to the effort, the Marin County Board of Supervisors has allocated $400,000 in public funds for the experiment. The program is similar to one recently completed in Stockton, Calif., but one major difference sets the Marin experiment apart: race and sex discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Stockton UBI experiment provided payments to 125 residents of neighborhoods at or below Stockton's median household income. The Marin regime will do the same, but beneficiaries must be \"mothers of color.\" That term is undefined, but it's clear that fathers and white mothers are ineligible to participate. A similar race-based scheme has been announced in Oakland, Calif.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter what one thinks of UBI as a policy matter, the use of public funds in the Marin scheme is legally dubious. The California Constitution's equal-protection clause, like the federal one in the 14th Amendment, applies \"strict scrutiny\"\u2014the highest possible level of judicial scrutiny\u2014to racial classifications. California courts, unlike federal ones, also apply strict scrutiny to sex classifications. In Connerly v. State Personnel Board (2001), a California appeals court made that clear in invalidating both race- and sex-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If I had grown up in Marin County under its proposed UBI regime, my family would have been ineligible to participate. I grew up poor and at times homeless or living in public housing projects. But my mother, who is white, was raising her three black children on her own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin Community Foundation's chief executive, Thomas Peters, has said that \"this first cohort will focus on low-income moms of color\" because they face \"the greatest aggregate of challenges: low income, young children and facing the daily travails and insults of overt and covert racial discrimination.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My mother was low-income, had three young children and faced racial discrimination. We lived in black communities where black men were stigmatized for consorting with white women, and that stigma flowed to those women and their biracial children.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If my mother was somehow privileged over similarly situated black mothers, it could only have been by the slimmest possible margin. To exclude someone like her from a public-assistance program on account of her skin color is the very definition of racial injustice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin UBI scheme threatens to drive the wedge of racial discord currently tearing wildly through our social fabric even deeper. And frankly, policies with good intentions such as UBI, which might conceivably help to address the intractable problem of poverty, will be tainted with the scarlet R of racism and the understandable suspicion of being a pretense for reparative racial justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Westhill is president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marin County's Discriminatory 'Universal Basic Income'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Devon Westhill</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/408580425.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Colorblind Conservatives?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I suppose it's easier to get engrossed in a subplot when the main story line has become fairly obvious. Maybe that's why, in this race of all-but-certain presidential nominees, I find myself distracted by Alan Keyes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or rather by the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes. I'm not suggesting that Keyes is likely to repeat in New Hampshire his startling showing in the Iowa caucuses--a third-place finish with 14 percent of the vote--much less that he'll still be battling George W. Bush for the Republican nomination as the party convention draws nearer. The subplot I've been following treats a much simpler question: Are white voters truly capable of looking beyond a black candidate's race?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans seem certain that the answer is \"no,\" while white voters--on much the same evidence--believe it has long since been answered in the affirmative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Didn't we help elect David Dinkins mayor of New York City and Doug Wilder governor of Virginia? whites will say. And blacks will reply: Yes, but in substantial measure out of racial guilt--which means that it was, at bottom, a race-tinged vote. Similarly with elected officials from Massachusetts's Ed Brooke to Oklahoma's J. C. Watts, and with that most-popular of noncandidates, Colin Powell. I remember remarking, with utter seriousness, that the white-led bandwagon for Powell was a way for white people to prove to themselves they had gotten over their fixation on race. Now Alan Keyes has me wondering if I've gotten over mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A televised interview with a handful of Iowans after the Keyes surprise makes my point. The reporter was talking to these white conservatives--members of what we call the \"religious right\"--and a couple of them were explaining how they compared Keyes and Gary Bauer and found Keyes's views more to their liking. One of the respondents mentioned that she'd like to see Keyes on the ticket of the eventual nominee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What struck me about that brief exchange was that it seemed genuinely to have nothing to do with race, only issues. And I was reminded by something in my long-repressed memory:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Strom Thurmond, as Old South and conservative as they come, standing up at those 1991 Judiciary Committee hearings for Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. I don't imagine Thurmond was motivated by racial angst. Indeed, the Senate's 1,000-year-old man seemed indifferent to the fact that Thomas's white wife, Virginia, was a daily fixture at those hearings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He may have supported Thomas for reasons I would reject, but on this issue, at least, Strom Thurmond seemed, like that woman in Iowa, to have surmounted race in favor of political philosophy. I have to think it's a good thing--and too little recognized by those of us who insist we want to be judged by characteristics other than the color of our skins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But look how these conservatives get beyond race--by supporting African Americans whose views are anathema to the rank and file of black voters. Doesn't that demonstrate their disregard for what black people in general think? Doesn't it suggest that the only way they can forget our race is by supporting black folk who have forgotten it too?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what would we expect?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That these dyed-in-the-wool conservatives--who oppose a woman's right to choose abortion, who think <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is Satan's own tool and who never saw a new government initiative they didn't hate-- should get out the vote for Jesse Jackson Sr.?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't mean to suggest that all conservatives have retired their suspicions of racial minorities, or that racism and a certain brand of conservatism have been disentangled. I'm suggesting only that those of us who refuse to believe that white people can be conservative without being against black people may have some disentangling of our own to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And a modest bit of celebration. For if conservatives--the people we have always viewed as our dedicated enemies--are willing to move beyond our race to consider our character and our philosophy, why there may be hope for white liberals, too.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 43s "}}
{"id": "test_question_pro_testing_1", "displayed_text": "<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

But this year, Morristown also had a live-action drama showcasing those unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The action began when a white supremacist from Mississippi won the right in court to hold a rally here yesterday. Richard Barrett, whose Nationalist Movement oath declares ''the white race is the superlative civilizer,'' said he chose Morristown because of its history. Just as George Washington ''said no to the privileges of the king, today we're saying no to the privileges of minorities,'' he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett got what he wanted yesterday -- helmeted police protecting his right to march on Washington Street, a crowd of angry counter-protesters that drew pepper spray and 10 arrests. A perfect forum for a man with bullhorn and bombast. Mr. Barrett brought to town an anemic anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> protest and a racist version of the Declaration of Independence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But on Monday night, as Mr. Barrett prepared to deliver his divisive message, Morristown made its elegant statement. About 1,000 people filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't have done it without him. ''We are here tonight to reject any notion that one race is superior to another,'' Calvary's pastor, the Rev. Jerry Carter, said to cheers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The service and a candlelight march to the Morristown Green were arranged at the urging of the mayor, John J. DeLaney Jr., who was looking for a way to counter Mr. Barrett without giving him the satisfaction of a confrontation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The town has about 17,000 residents --  about 15 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic -- and just around the corner from Calvary church is evidence that all is not harmonious. Outside a house, a sign commemorates the death of a black resident who was killed last year by the police in a neighboring town. Prosecutors cleared the officers, but, for some, his death remains an example of racial profiling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MONDAY night, though, was a display of racial accord. Rabbi David Nesson of Morristown's Jewish Community Center reminded the crowd that Washington once wrote to a synagogue in Newport, R.I., that one of the country's guiding ideals was ''to give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jakki Dumas-Footman, 33, a financial analyst, said she felt compelled to come to the service with her daughter even though she grew up black in a largely white Morristown neighborhood and rarely felt racism. ''I've never seen a K.K.K. march,'' she said. ''I brought my daughter. She knows about the K.K.K. I want her to see it. This is our history, in a way.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nate Moore, a 58-year-old computer consultant, came Monday night remembering that history from having grown up black in Alabama. Mr. Barrett's message ''really astounded me,'' he said. ''I really thought these days were passed.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The songs of equality at the church recalled the old days, Mr. Moore said, but there were more white faces in the pews,  and the ranks of racists were thinner. ''I think you have to accept the differences and move on,'' he said. ''I think that's what we're doing more of -- accepting the differences and moving on.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But moving on is not a straight course.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monday night's harmony gave way to yesterday's ugliness. Mr. Barrett's sad parade of eight followers was separated from an angry crowd of about 250 by barricades and helmeted police on horses. At the height of the event, protesters from groups including the Progressive Labor Party were hurling vile taunts at the police as some protesters knocked down barricades and threw golf balls and batteries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asa Watkins, an 83-year-old artist from Morristown, had come to oppose Mr. Barrett, but was taken aback by the anger on both sides.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Watkins was reminded that Washington had spent two treacherous winters in Morristown on the way to victory. This Fourth of July freedom had another tough, but victorious, round in Morristown. ''It's a messy process, democracy is,'' said Mr. Watkins, leaving the rally. ''It always is.''</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 57s "}}

A coalition of civil rights groups made the settlement possible by agreeing to pay 70 percent of the $433,500 judgment that Sharon Taxman won in a lower court for back pay and lawyers' fees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> thought that the Supreme Court, which was scheduled to hear the case in January, was likely to find the race-based layoff decision improper.
