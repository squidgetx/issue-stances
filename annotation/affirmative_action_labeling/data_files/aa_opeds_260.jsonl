{"id": "txt/432267882.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Bonfire Of the Vanities</h2<p>E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's only one thing left for Trent Lott to do now. He will have to become a Democrat.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In his doomed but endlessly inventive effort to grovel his way back to political favor by taking positions way to the left of his own party, the senator came out for ''across the board'' affirmative action and pledged to proclaim the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation some kind of quasi-Kwanzaa holiday. If the Lott panderthon had lasted into the weekend, he might yet have endorsed Al Sharpton's theory of the Tawana Brawley case or popped up on Comedy Central to host a holiday festival of ''Sanford and Son'' reruns. Tom Wolfe couldn't make this stuff up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But of course he already did. The hypocrisy and cynicism we saw in the Lott affair from nearly all parties -- political and otherwise -- was ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' all over again. The supposed cause of our new racial uproar, the senator's remarks at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party, rapidly became irrelevant to the big picture (as did the clueless majority leader himself). Is Mr. Lott a racist? According to Jim Jeffords, former Senator Paul Simon and nearly everyone else who knows him, he's not. But after awhile that no longer mattered. Mr. Lott had become, in the words of a widely quoted (but unidentified) White House hand, a ''walking pinata.'' And a most convenient one. Republicans, Democrats and the press alike could all prove our moral superiority, cost-free, by stringing up a certifiable fool.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But we shouldn't congratulate ourselves quite so fast. The Lott story didn't break this month -- it broke four years ago. Where was the press then? Where were the Democrats? From December 1998 until the following spring, a black columnist at New York's Daily News, the politically nonpartisan Stanley Crouch, repeatedly laid out goods on Mr. Lott more damaging than the senator's latest transgression: his long and intimate association with the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens, an organization whose initials are not a phonic echo of K.K.K. for nothing. A few newspaper reporters and columnists recounted the same history, but Mr. Crouch, instead of winning a Pulitzer, was largely ignored by big guns in the media as well as by political leaders of both parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Lott's new offense almost fell through the journalistic cracks as well. Though his embrace of Mr. Thurmond's past took place in a room full of Washington reporters and politicos and was broadcast on C-Span, it was not at first reported in any paper (or on any evening TV news broadcast), even those that did cover the Thurmond party. Why? It may be because the spectacle of a leading Republican backslapping with unreconstructed Dixiecrats did not initially strike anyone as big news.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When Jeb Bush succinctly condemned Mr. Lott for the crime of being ''damaging to the Republican Party'' -- as opposed to, say, being damaging to black people -- he was telling the truth. Mr. Lott would not have hurt his party were he an anomaly within it. What made him toxic to the Republican fraternity was his careless revelation of its darkest predilections.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among the Lott transgressions that resurfaced during his trial-by-media was an occasion in the 1990's, cited by Robert George in The New York Post, when he summoned black staffers abruptly into his personal office ''to provide 'color' for photos in a media profile.'' Such a media strategy is no different from that of the 2000 Republican convention, where the party filled the stage with a ''Soul Train'' jamboree of break dancers and gospel singers to provide ''color'' for its own image. The goal of that minstrel show -- as well as of the strategic planting of black faces in likely TV shots on the floor -- was to belie the fact that black delegates at that convention made up 4 percent, a historic low for the party (even lower than at the Pat Buchanan-Pat Robertson convention in Houston in 1996).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Lott's public display of nostalgia for the South's racist past is hardly unique either. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, gave an interview to a neo-Confederate magazine, Southern Partisan, in 1999 in which he vowed ''to do more'' to defend the legacy of Jefferson Davis, a Lott hero as well, from anyone who would smear him for having ''some perverted agenda.'' (Slavery, perhaps?) Some of Mr. Ashcroft's actions in public life have matched his words. When he was Missouri attorney general in the 1980's, a federal judge threatened to hold him and his state in contempt for their ''continual delay and failure to comply'' with a landmark voluntary desegregation plan in St. Louis, according to a Washington Post report in January 2001. When running for governor, Mr. Ashcroft even boasted of having done ''everything in my power legally'' to fight that plan. This was 35 years after Mr. Thurmond's Dixiecrat candidacy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In its effort to portray Mr. Lott as a one-of-a-kind bad apple, The Wall Street Journal's editorial page said on Thursday: ''Republicans may once have used race to polarize the electorate, especially in the South. But that strategy long ago stopped being useful.'' Tell that to George W. Bush, who beat John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary after what Newsweek called ''a smear campaign'' of leaflets, e-mails and telephone calls calling attention to the McCains' ''black child'' (an adopted daughter from Bangladesh). Or to Sonny Perdue, the new Republican governor of Georgia, elected in part by demagoguing the sanctity of the Confederate flag.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Long ago stopped being useful? Tell that to Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Bush, who appeared at Bob Jones University in 1999 and 2000. ''Of all universities in America,'' asked the commentator Fareed Zakaria on ABC last weekend, ''why is it that Republicans have felt the need to make a pilgrimage to the one university that bans interracial dating?'' Now that Mr. Lott is no longer the issue, will any of the conservatives who called for his decapitation answer that question?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The point here is not that these Republican leaders are racists, or that all (or most) Republicans are racist, or that all racists are Republicans. ''These are not normal Republican ideas,'' wrote the conservative author David Brooks, in a characteristically thoughtful piece about Mr. Lott in this week's Newsweek. And he's right. But there are still too many Republican politicians who believe they can pander to whatever racist voters are out there without being called on it. When they are, they cringe -- not so much because they care about losing their few black votes but because they care about losing soccer moms who are offended by race-baiting. ''Elections are settled in the suburbs nowadays, 43 percent of the vote,'' said George Will in condemning Mr. Lott. It's that political reality, not any moral imperative, that mandated the majority leader's death sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>President Bush is no bigot, and as he likes to remind us, some of his best employees are Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. He is in favor of something called ''affirmative access'' -- which has led to a grand total of zero black Republican Congressmen in the next Congress. ''Compassionate conservatism'' seems less a program than a p.r. strategy to provide cover for the likes of a Lott or an Ashcroft.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Asked this week what the administration has done for black Americans, Ari Fleischer used the kind of examples we heard from Mr. Lott. He said that ''the president looks forward to going to Africa'' (how patronizing can you be?) and wants ''to double funding for historically black colleges and universities'' (weren't the Republicans for color-blind policies rather than a politically correct form of de facto segregation?). Mr. Fleischer also said that the president sees education as ''the next civil rights movement.'' If so, Mr. Bush is not that movement's courageous leader; in his education bill, he dumped the tiny school voucher provision that Republican polls say many black families want.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Black voters are not fooled by such empty theatrics. For all the ''diversity'' at his convention and his rhetorical ''compassion,'' Mr. Bush drew a third less of the black vote than his father and Bob Dole did. The White House's main concern now is that white voters be fooled. So Republicans are trying to create a moral equivalence between Democratic racial lapses and their own, hoping that Robert Byrd's long-renounced K.K.K. past and use of the word ''nigger'' will somehow blur their own recent record. Bill Frist is the ideal new Senate majority leader, because his own genuinely good works in Africa and ''compassionate conservative'' geniality will camouflage a voting pattern that, on any issue touching black Americans, is virtually the same as Mr. Lott's.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I almost feel sorry for Trent Lott. Despite all the hyperbole that preceded his demise, he is no Bull Connor or David Duke or even Jesse Helms. He's just the guy who had to die before anyone looked too closely at other, even more powerful politicians' sins.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Drawing</p>\n"}

In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of affirmative action and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University. He was student-body president from May 2019 to September 2020.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/418768610.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>USDA SETTLEMENT ADVANCES ARGUMENT FOR REPARATIONS</h2<p>While the public's attention was diverted by the partisan spectacle unfolding in the U.S. Senate, something just as momentous happened on the other end of Washington: The federal government agreed for the first time since Reconstruction to pay reparations to African-Americans for the damages of past racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A federal judge tentatively approved an agreement requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to black farmers because of the government's history of racial bias. The historic ruling settled a 1997 class-action lawsuit initiated by more than 1,000 black farmers that charged the U.S. Agriculture Department with racial discrimination in distributing farm loans and subsidies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The settlement requires the USDA to provide at least $50,000 in cash and debt relief to black farmers who it agrees were denied government loans and other assistance because of their race. One provision of the agreement also requires the federal government to return foreclosed lands to affected farmers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>African-Americans were 14 percent of American farmers in 1920 and today they are far less than 1 percent, according to John Boyd Jr., of the National Black Farmers Association. Boyd and other black farmers blame the USDA's discriminatory practices for that rapid land loss and several federal probes of the agency have supported those charges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A 1982 study by the Civil Rights Commission predicted that black farmers would be extinct by 2000 unless drastic action were taken by the federal government.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of the 1.4 million people who operated or managed farms in 1995, just 8,000 were black, according to recent figures from the Census Bureau.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Total claims in the recent settlement are expected to exceed $375 million, but the exact figure is impossible to calculate until officials have a better idea of the number of affected farmers. The lawsuit sought $3.5 billion and many farmers are complaining that the settlement is too little too late to be of any real assistance. Despite the inadequacies of the specific settlement, however, it provides the rationale for a more extensive claim of reparations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Black farmers initiated the litigation in 1997 after an internal USDA investigation found an entrenched history of anti-black practices, reaffirming what many previous probes concluded. Although the lawsuit focused specifically on the period from 1981 to 1996, it could well have picked any period in American history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The suit argued that the current economic inequities of black farmers--as a \"class\"--are rooted in a history of government-approved racial bias and that financial compensation helps redress the legacy of that history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That logic also justifies reparations as compensation to African- Americans--as a \"class\"--to help redress 2 1/2 centuries of slavery, a century of official apartheid and decades of de facto discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The accumulation of disadvantages blacks suffered during this period--including a coercive diversion of wealth and cultural capital--provide a compelling explanation for current wealth and health disparities between black and white Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In attempts to redress the damage of that history, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has continuously reintroduced, since 1989, a bill designed to examine slavery's impact on African-Americans. His bill, The Commission to Study Reparations Proposals for African-Americans Act, has failed to garner sufficient support and languished in the House.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Arguments favoring reparations not only are logical, they also offer a welcome respite from the acrimonious debates about affirmative action and other preference policies. The cost of federal reparations would be spread throughout the tax system and would be justified by both a cold economic calculus and moral responsibility.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That sense of responsibility, for example, helps explain why few Germans complain about their country's payments of more than $100 billion to Israel in reparations for damage done to Jewish victims during the Nazi era.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The last time the federal government issued land as reparations for racism was during Reconstruction, when Gen. O. O. Howard of the Freedmen's Bureau urged ex-slaves be granted \"40 acres and a mule.\" His suggestion was implemented on a tiny scale for a short time only on the Sea Islands, off the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, but became a catch phrase for former slaves and their descendants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>President Andrew Johnson, the only other president to be impeached, halted that experiment in reparations with polices that ended Reconstruction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>President Bill Clinton hailed the recent settlement with his administration as an important step in ongoing efforts \"to redress any harm that has been caused by past discrimination against African- American family farmers.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How ironic that the second president to be impeached has effectively resumed that experiment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>E-mail: Salim4x@aol.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Margaret Scott.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/432419685.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>A Moderate Term on the Court</h2<p>''Th' supreme coort,'' Mr. Dooley famously observed, ''follows th' iliction returns.'' A century after Finley Peter Dunne's fictional Irish saloonkeeper made the point, the court has put an interesting spin on Mr. Dooley's theory. At a time when President Bush and his Republican majority in Congress are continually arguing that they have the mandate to appoint extreme conservatives to the federal bench, the highest court of all has surprised many people with its moderation. The Supreme Court, it appears, is better at reading the election returns than some elected politicians.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Conservative legal groups had high hopes that the nine justices -- seven of whom were appointed by Republican presidents -- would issue a landmark ruling this term striking down affirmative action. But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joining the court's most liberal members in a 5-to-4 vote, upheld the University of Michigan's use of race in admissions. By endorsing the consideration of race, but barring quotas and rigid formulas, the court essentially ratified an existing national consensus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the term's other blockbuster decision, the court ruled 6 to 3 that gay sexual relations are constitutionally protected. In doing so, it erased one of its own worst precedents, the 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, and struck an important blow for gay rights generally. And it brought the law in line with evolving popular opinion, which now solidly holds that private consensual sex should be legal, and that gays should not be subject to discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The court surprised the legal community by halting, or at least pausing in, its aggressive states' rights crusade. Until this term the conservative majority, led by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, had been steadily whittling away at Americans' rights under federal law. It struck down the Violence Against Women Act on ''federalism'' grounds, and held that the nation's 4.8 million state employees are only partly protected by federal disability and age discrimination laws. But this term the court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, rejected a federalism claim and held that state workers are fully protected by the Family and Medical Leave Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the court's inclination to stick to the mainstream meant it did an uneven job of protecting the marginalized from the excesses of the majority. The court callously turned away a challenge to California's ''three strikes'' law by a man who was given a sentence of 50 years to life for stealing $150 worth of videotapes from Kmart. Justice O'Connor, whose status as the court's critical swing vote was solidified this year, provided the majority with its fifth vote in that case. But she was also the swing vote to uphold Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts, a vital source of funds for legal services for the poor nationwide that was challenged by conservative legal groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This term showed just how far right the court's three most conservative members are. The dissent in the gay sex case -- by the chief justice, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -- fulminated, like a talk show rant, about a ''homosexual agenda.'' But there is no equivalent core of justices on the left trying to push beyond the legal expression of mainstream American thought. No justice wrote separately to say the principles the court laid down offer support for gay marriage. On subjects from civil rights to criminal law, the ideological spectrum ranges from the far right on one side to liberal centrism on the other.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The final week of the session, when the decisions on affirmative action and the sodomy law came down, are sure to energize right-wing activists, who were already upset with the court's moderation and vowing to fill the next vacancy with another Justice Scalia or Justice Thomas. An extreme choice for a single slot could have a profound impact on American life -- limiting the ability of the federal government to protect the environment, and ending affirmative action and, perhaps, abortion rights. The court's performance over the last nine months was not perfect, but it generally reflected the best instincts of the American people. The Senate, and public, must not allow this to change.</p>\n"}

The House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties held a hearing about H.R. 40, a proposal from Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, that would authorize a national apology and study reparations for slavery against black people in America, or as Ta-Nehisi Coates referred to it in his testimony, a method that entailed \u201ctorture, rape, and child trafficking\u201d for 250 years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The hearing date was significant.

The black story doesn\u2019t cease to exist because others choose to ignore it. And the timeline of the black experience on these shores did not stop when Barack Obama became president.

{"id": "txt/398538903.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Useful distinctions</h2<p>The phrase \"useful distinction\" seems to have lost its usefulness. It described a way of trying to think precisely about problems and weighing competing claims. But today our system generally seems to operate at the level of \"all or nothing.\" The Gingrich tax-exempt affair, for example, was immediately driven to the level of Watergate. Something similar seems to be happening in the wake of the California Civil Rights Initiative on affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ward Connerly and the other sponsors of CCRI have formed the American Civil Rights Institute to take their initiative campaign against government-sponsored quotas and set-asides nationwide. They're being bitterly opposed by the forces and groups who give the strong impression that merely to raise questions about the status of affirmative action is to commit sin beyond forgiveness. But the fact is that CCRI passed, with nearly 30% of blacks voting for it. Our sense of the public mood is that all-or-nothing proponents of affirmative action need to start making some useful distinctions in public. Such balancing considerations are raised explicitly by the case of Astroline Communications Company.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Astroline was a limited partnership that in 1984 gained control of WHCT, Channel 18, a TV station in Hartford. The partnership benefited from the FCC's \"minority distress sale policy,\" which gives preferential treatment in assigning certain broadcast licenses to companies in which a minority owns a 20% equity stake and exercises \"complete control over the station's affairs.\" That policy was challenged in court on constitutional grounds by a competitor for the Channel 18 license, Alan Shurberg.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In response to his suit, a federal appeals court struck down the FCC's policy as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. But the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the FCC set-asides in a 1990 decision, Metro Broadcasting v. FCC. Writing for a 5-4 majority, then-Justice William Brennan held that the set-aside policy was legitimate because it achieved \"the important government objective of broadcast diversity.\" This represented the high-water mark of the Supreme Court's support for racial preferences. But in Adarand Constructors v. Pena (1995), the newly constituted Court essentially reversed Metro Broadcasting and raised almost insurmountable barriers to government set-aside programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To see why the court's new color-blind policy in this area makes sense, let's look at facts that have come to light about Astroline Broadcasting. The company has gone into bankruptcy, eventually making its tax records available to Mr. Shurberg, who continues his quest to win the license. In a petition filed with the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Mr. Shurberg contends that Astroline wasn't exactly what it claimed to be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When it won its license, Astroline did have a minority who owned the requisite 21% of the company -- its general manager, Richard Ramirez. But according to the tax records, Mr. Ramirez's stake in the company declined to 0.75% by the following year. The records also indicate that Mr. Ramirez, Astroline's ostensible owner, invested exactly $210 in the company. His partners -- all apparently \"non-minorities,\" according to Mr. Shurberg -- contributed more than $23 million.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Ramirez acknowledges in an interview that he put up only $210, but says that he also added \"sweat equity\" and that he never gave up control of the company. \"It's preposterous to claim that I didn't run that business,\" he says. Eventually this will be resolved by the FCC and the courts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the world of all-or-nothing, the complaints of an Alan Shurberg against the gaming of set-asides have no chance of support from affirmative action proponents. But a point arrives in an open system like ours, with news widely available, that one's cause begins to develop problems of credibility. People who watched the Texaco case unfold now see big-money class actions being filed that allege racist e-mail in other companies. But then when a CCRI-like effort emerges, its supporters are attacked as loonies beyond discussion. Under the circumstances, a revival of \"useful distinctions\" looks very much in order.</p>\n"}

It needs a renewed emphasis on its founding spirit.</h2<p>WEDNESDAY MARKS the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice, which is both auspicious and, to many Americans, possibly surprising. Central as it is to American government, this Cabinet-level agency did not exist at the founding. There was little in the way of federal law, civil or criminal, until the Civil War. In the aftermath of that conflict, however, Congress established the department. The reformist purpose was to get rid of the expensive private attorneys \u2014 often party hacks \u2014 whom the federal government had previously hired to represent it, and to replace them with full-time professionals supervised by the attorney general. Simultaneously, Congress gave the department a new responsibility: to enforce the first-ever federal statutes designed to protect the civil rights of African Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Awareness of this history only compounds our dismay at the department's course under the Trump administration and the most recent attorney general, William P. Barr. Instead of impartiality and professionalism, there have been presidential interference with policy and personnel decisions and unjustified leniency for political favorites. Instead of an aggressive civil rights posture, there have been reluctance to investigate systemic violations by police departments, backing for lawsuits against affirmative action in college admissions and, from Mr. Barr himself, support for a police sweep of nonviolent protesters in Lafayette Square to make room for President Trump to stage a photo op.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some partisanship, real and perceived, is inevitable given that the ultimate power over federal law enforcement resides with politicians in Congress and the White House. In that sense, creating the department in 1870 was, at best, a partial fix for a dilemma inherent to the Constitution. From the beginning, and increasingly since the mushrooming of federal law enforcement authority in the 20th century, critics have accused the Justice Department of undermining the rule of law rather than upholding it, as anyone familiar with the careers of A. Mitchell Palmer or John N. Mitchell \u2014 or even Robert F. Kennedy \u2014 knows. The troubling covert surveillance warrants against Trump supporter Carter Page belong on that list, too.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One way to reduce the risk of politicized or otherwise abusive federal law enforcement may be to reduce the sheer scope of federal criminal law, which has become overgrown and duplicative. As part of criminal justice reform, Congress should trim the excess, consistent both with the Constitution's assignment of primary responsibility for crime control to the states, and with the efficiency-promoting aims of the department's founders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ultimately, though, a large role for the Justice Department must remain \u2014 the legitimacy of which will depend on the ethos of its leaders, up to and including the president. Despite its imperfections, this is an indispensable institution; its career staff represents a vital national repository of public-spirited talent. These officials embody the legacy of reform and heightened independence in the post-Watergate years \u2014 a period that provides a hopeful precedent for today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>More than new policies or procedures, the Justice Department needs rededication to its founding spirit \u2014 professionalism and impartiality \u2014 and renewed emphasis on its oldest mission: civil rights. The Trump administration has shown itself incapable of that rededication. The next president and attorney general will have to do the job, urgently.</p>\n"}

Today President Clinton will be at Central High to open the door for the nine men and women whose courageous walk opened doors for so many others. He will be introduced by student body president Fatima McKendra, honor student, aspiring surgeon, African American. This young woman could not have been student body president in 1957.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How far have we really come in 40 years? How far have we left to go? I was 2 years old when those brave students walked through angry, jeering crowds, past armed soldiers to the front door of Central High. It was not until years later that, as an African American teenager, I had the occasion to go to school with white children in Marianna, Ark.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And still it was not easy. After my school canceled a program celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, students staged a sit-in. They were chased from the school grounds by firemen spraying them with high-powered blasts of water. The student officers, including myself, who had been meeting in the principal's office were taken to the police station. We did not go back to school that year. And when I did go back, I was not allowed to play sports, a severe penalty for someone who later went to college on a football and academic scholarship.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was a watershed experience for me. I learned that you have to take a stand in what you believe is right. There is always a cost. But often there is a higher cost for not taking a stand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tolerance actually got an early start in Arkansas. The University of Arkansas law and medical schools had been integrated since 1948. The city of Little Rock already had desegregated its public buses, its zoo, its library and its parks system, and its citizens were poised to deal with integration in a positive way. They were guided by what President Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. But the actions of a few encouraged the lesser angels to manifest themselves. Notwithstanding, justice prevailed, the school was integrated and Ernest Green, the lone senior of the Little Rock Nine, graduated in May 1958.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We have come a long way since then. Our economy is healthy, unemployment is low, and the African American middle class has grown substantially.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But despite our progress, we are slowed by unfinished business. We still are wary of those different from us. Too often, we talk less to each other and more at each other, if we talk at all. As terrible as things were 40 years ago, at least people knew exactly where they stood. Things were out in the open and on the table. Ironically, racism clad in a hooded sheet was much more identifiable than much of the racism of today, which often wears a smile and a business suit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Granted, problems 40 years ago were more blatant. What we face today is more subtle, but still insidious. We get a glimpse when we hear about demeaning conversations in corporate boardrooms. Or when affirmative action rules are lifted at state universities and minority enrollment plummets. Or when academics and writers fall back on discredited arguments to justify persistent stereotypes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And tensions now go beyond the conflict between black and white: the vile burning of churches, a resurgence of antisemitism and hostility toward new immigrants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But we have to learn to live together, because the face of America is changing. Today in Hawaii, everyone is a minority.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Soon this will be true of California. And 40 years from now, there will be no majority race in America.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We can look at statistics and know what America will look like in the 21st century. But we have to look inside ourselves to determine what America will be like in the 21st century.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The president is asking all Americans to join him in a national conversation about race to face one another honestly across lines that still divide us. Clearly, now is the time for honest dialogue, the time to build a society that recognizes the worth of all people and honors the dignity of every person.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Until every American has real economic opportunity and first-rate educational opportunity, there will be disparities that will look like racial discrimination, whether they are or not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Melba P. Bealls, one of the Little Rock Nine, put it best: \"The task that remains is to cope with our interdependence to see ourselves reflected in every other human being and to respect and honor our differences.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Laws can change institutions, but they cannot change what is in people's hearts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The writer is secretary of transportation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTO,,Arkansas Democrat Via Ap/will Counts</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/424669038.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Editorial Notebook; Morris Abram, LBJ and Neutrality</h2<p>They were nervous, milling about in Lyndon Johnson's White House.  When was the last time a President had called together the press secretaries of all the departments? What did he want? He marched in, big, brown-suited and angry, and told them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He was tired, he said, of being compared unfavorably with John Kennedy, especially on civil rights. JFK had a fine record, he said.  But so, dammit, did he. ''Some day,'' he thundered, ''you'll tell your grandchildren you were proud to have been part of the Johnson Administration.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His words came to mind last week when Morris Abram testified on his nomination to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The testimony, like Lyndon Johnson's civil rights record, turns on one of the great unsettled issues of our time: affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It underlies almost every aspect of modern race relations - and it remains open as America struggles over how much to do to relieve the enduring effects of slavery and bigotry.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Morris Abram is a lifelong enemy of that bigotry. To imply otherwise does injustice to a man of public, and private, courage.  But the respect due a man of principle need not extend to his every principle. And when it comes to affirmative action, the position he enunciated again last week is technical, bloodless, uncharacteristically ungenerous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To him, affirmative action is permissible only if neutral. He believes ''it is morally and legally wrong to discrimate against any person or to discriminate in favor of any person.'' To do otherwise is to concur in ''governmentally enforced quotas.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Quotas offend him deeply because Racism Is Different.  So Is the Case For Preference the power to prefer one group today is the power to prefer another tomorrow. Other aggrieved minorities, including white ethnic groups, will demand special treatment, setting the stage ''for conflict - and tragedy.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Do other minorities have grounds for complaint? Of course. American life is punctuated with signs that read ''No Irish Need Apply'' or with anti-Jewish quotas at medical schools. But Mr. Abram evidently finds it hard to distinguish these grievances from the relentless racism of centuries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even conceding that, Mr. Abram still thinks it wrong for government to give preference to one group. Yet government does that all the time. As Justice Blackmun observed in the Bakke case, government regularly gives preferences to veterans, the handicapped, Indians and, with the progressive income tax, to many others. ''In order to get beyond racism,'' he wrote, ''we must first take account of race.  There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's every reason for the present generation of Americans to try conscientiously to redress the enduring wrongs of our past. And, if we want more than proclamations of virtue, we need a way of keeping score.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Abram does not oppose remedial action. He insists that he is for, if not affirmative action, at least ''social assistance.'' For instance, he would provide job training to all who would work but lack the skills. But then why shrink from devising ways to open up jobs, too? To Mr. Abram, that raises the hateful idea of quotas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Attaching numbers to affirmative action need not - should not - mean guaranteed numerical outcomes. It is a way to make institutions accountable, to measure their honest efforts to find minority employees, students, applicants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Abram is entitled to his chilly neutrality. What he is not entitled to do is cite Lyndon Johnson in its defense. If one really wants to know what Lyndon Johnson thought of affirmative action, head and heart, one should recall his words at Howard University in 1965, words that have not been improved on since:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''Freedom is not enough ...You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'you are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been competely fair. Thus it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates ....</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''To this end equal opportunity is essential, but not enough, not enough. Men and women of all races are born with the same range of abilities. But ability is not just the product of birth ...It is the product of a hundred unseen forces playing upon the little infant, the child, and finally the man.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Freedom is not enough, Mr. Abram. Equal opportunity is not enough.  Neither is neutrality.</p>\n"}

The relation between freedom and literacy became the compelling theme of the slave narratives, the great body of printed books that ex-slaves generated to assert their common humanity with white Americans and to indict the system that had oppressed them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the years since the abolition of slavery, the possession of literacy has been a cardinal value of the African-American tradition. It is no accident that the first great victory in the legal battle over segregation was fought on the grounds of education -- of equal access to literacy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today, blacks are failing to gain access to the new tools of literacy: the digital ''knowledge economy.'' And while the dilemma that our ancestors confronted was imposed by others, this cybersegregation is, to a large degree, self-imposed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Government's latest attempt to understand why low-income African-Americans and Hispanics are slower to embrace the Internet and the personal computer than whites -- the Commerce Department study ''Falling Through the Net'' -- suggests that income alone can't be blamed for the so-called digital divide. For example, among families earning $15,000 to $35,000 annually, more than 33 percent of whites own computers, compared with only 19 percent of African-Americans -- a gap that has widened 64 percent over the past five years despite declining computer prices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The implications go far beyond on-line trading and chat rooms. Net promoters are concerned that the digital divide threatens to become a 21st century poll tax that, in effect, disenfranchises a third of the nation. Our children, especially, need access not only to the vast resources that technology offers for education, but also to the rich cultural contexts that define their place in the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today we stand at the brink of becoming two societies, one largely white and plugged in and the other black and unplugged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the most tragic aspects of slavery was the way it destroyed social connections. In a process that the sociologist Orlando Patterson calls ''social death,'' slavery sought to sever blacks from their history and culture, from family ties and a sense of community. And, of course, de jure segregation after the Civil War was intended to disconnect blacks from equal economic opportunity, from the network of social contacts that enable upward mobility and, indeed, from the broader world of ideas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Despite the dramatic growth of the black middle class since affirmative action programs were started in the late 60's, new forms of disconnectedness have afflicted black America. Middle-class professionals often feel socially and culturally isolated from their white peers at work and in the neighborhood and from their black peers left behind in the underclass. The children of the black underclass, in turn, often lack middle-class role models to help them connect to a history of achievement and develop their analytical skills.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It would be a sad irony if the most diverse and decentralized electronic medium yet invented should fail to achieve ethnic diversity among its users. And yet the Commerce Department study suggests that the solution will require more than cheap PC's. It will involve content.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Until recently, the African-American presence on the Internet was minimal, reflecting the chicken-and-egg nature of Internet economics. Few investors have been willing to finance sites appealing to a PC-scarce community. Few African-Americans have been compelled to sign on to a medium that offers little to interest them. And educators interested in diversity have repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of minority-oriented educational software.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Consider the birth of the recording industry in the 1920's. Blacks began to respond to this new medium only when mainstream companies like Columbia Records introduced so-called race records, blues and jazz discs aimed at a nascent African-American market. Blacks who would never have dreamed of spending hard-earned funds for a record by Rudy Vallee or Kate Smith would stand in lines several blocks long to purchase the new Bessie Smith or Duke Ellington hit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>New content made the new medium attractive. And the growth of Web sites dedicated to the interests and needs of black Americans can play the same role for the Internet that race records did for the music industry.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But even making sites that will appeal to a black audience can only go so far. The causes of poverty are both structural and behavioral. And it is the behavioral aspect of this cybersegregation that blacks themselves are best able to address. Drawing on corporate and foundation support, we can transform the legion of churches, mosques and community centers in our inner cities into after-school centers that focus on redressing the digital divide and teaching black history. We can draw on the many examples of black achievement in structured classes to re-establish a sense of social connection.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Internet is the 21st century's talking drum, the very kind of grass-roots communication tool that has been such a powerful source of education and culture for our people since slavery. But this talking drum we have not yet learned to play. Unless we master the new information technology to build and deepen the forms of social connection that a tragic history has eroded, African-Americans will face a form of cybersegregation in the next century as devastating to our aspirations as Jim Crow segregation was to those of our ancestors. But this time, the fault will be our own.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Illustration (Stephen Doyle)</p>\n"}

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, affirmative action and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of affirmative action, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of affirmative action the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between affirmative action and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398730713.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>On Media Bias, Network Stars Are Rather Clueless</h2<p>Dan Rather has been on television more than usual lately, popping up all over the place promoting his book about American success stories and along the way wearily denying that he's the left-wing devil some conservatives think he is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's the same old story as far as Dan is concerned. The right thinks he's an unapologetic liberal who slants the news leftward -- not because he is, but because his critics are so hopelessly biased themselves that they wouldn't know straight news when they saw it. As another evening star, Peter Jennings, told Larry King recently, bias often is in the eye of the beholder. And since Tom Brokaw also has publicly denied a liberal bias, it's official. There is none. It's all a figment of the reactionary imagination. Case closed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Except, as just about everyone who lives between Manhattan and Malibu knows, there is a leftward tilt on the big-three evening newscasts. A poll last year by Brill's Content showed that 74% of Republicans spotted a liberal bias. No bulletin there. But 47% of Democrats agreed, believing that \"most journalists are more liberal than they are.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So how can three otherwise intelligent, worldly men be so delusional when it comes to their own business? One possibility, of course, is that they're not delusional at all. They know they're slanting the news and they're simply doing what a lot of people do when caught red-handed. They're denying it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But that's not it, as far as I can figure. I'd bet that if you hooked Dan and Tom and Peter up to a lie detector and asked them if there's a liberal bias on their newscasts, they'd all say \"no\" and they'd all pass the test.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That leaves one other possibility. Messrs. Rather, Brokaw and Jennings don't even know what liberal bias is. I concede this is hard to believe, but I'm convinced it's why we keep getting these ridiculous denials, such as Mr. Rather's response to Geraldo Rivera the other night. Geraldo said, \"What I can't figure out is why you rub the right so wrong.\" Dan thought it was because some people \"subscribe to the idea either you report the news the way we want you to report it, or we're gonna tag . . . [a] negative sign on you.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The problem is that Mr. Rather and the other evening stars think that liberal bias means just one thing: going hard on Republicans and easy on Democrats. But real media bias comes not so much from what party they attack. Liberal bias is the result of how they see the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Consider this: In 1996 after I wrote about liberal bias on this very page, Dan was furious and during a phone conversation he indicated that picking The Wall Street Journal to air my views was especially appalling given the conservative views of the paper's editorial page. \"What do you consider the New York Times?\" I asked him, since he had written op-eds for that paper. \"Middle of the road,\" he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I couldn't believe he was serious. The Times is a newspaper that has taken the liberal side of every important social issue of our time, which is fine with me. But if you see the New York Times editorial page as middle of the road, one thing is clear: You don't have a clue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And it is this inability to see liberal views as liberal that is at the heart of the entire problem. This is why Phyllis Schlafly is the conservative woman who heads that conservative organization but Patricia Ireland is merely the head of NOW. No liberal labels necessary. Robert Bork is the conservative judge. Laurence Tribe is the noted Harvard law professor. Rush Limbaugh is the conservative talk show host. Rosie O'Donnell is simply Rosie O'Donnell, no matter how many liberal opinions she shares with her audience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And that's why the media stars can so easily talk about \"right wing\" Republicans and \"right wing\" Christians and \"right wing\" Miami Cubans and \"right wing\" radio talk-show hosts. But the only time they utter the words \"left wing\" is when they're talking about an airplane.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Conservatives must be identified because the audience needs to know these are people with axes to grind. But liberals don't need to be identified because their views on all the big social issues -- from abortion and gun control to the death penalty and affirmative action -- aren't liberal views at all. They're simply reasonable views, shared by all the reasonable people the media elites mingle with at all their reasonable dinner parties in Manhattan and Georgetown.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reporters pride themselves on their skepticism. Yet many uncritically pass along the views of liberal activists in a way they would never do with conservatives. The homeless lobby tells the media there are five million homeless and 10 minutes later it's on the evening news. Why is it that the media elites aren't nearly as cozy with with the anti-affirmative action or pro-life lobbies?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The media elites can float through their personal lives and rarely run into someone with an opposing view. This is very unhealthy and sometimes downright ridiculous, as when Pauline Kael, for years the brilliant film critic at The New Yorker, was completely baffled about how Richard Nixon could have beaten George McGovern in 1972: \"Nobody I know voted for Nixon.\" Never mind that Nixon carried 49 states. She wasn't kidding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If there is one group that is uniquely unqualified to comment on liberal bias it's the big-time media stars. So Dan and Tom and Peter: Stop telling us that we're the problem, and start thinking about what liberal bias really means.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Goldberg was a correspondent for CBS News from 1972 until 2000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Reporters Need Course In Basic Capitalism\" -- WSJ June 5, 2001)</p>\n"}

But then everything went to heck on the PR front, and evidently now you can say anything you want about the company, since any attempt to correct the record on its behalf is no longer \"credible.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By some transitive property that we don't fully understand, this even stripped the company of the presumption of innocence in legal matters. Journalists, no longer fearing Coke's efforts to hold them to the truth, no longer seem to hew to the cautious path they did a year ago. Thus Business Week's Dean Foust feels free to offer a lecture on what \"racist\" Coke must do to redeem itself because \"its Southern bottlers taunted and terrorized Coke's first black salesmen\" and \"legendary Chief Executive Robert S. Woodruff questioned civil rights legislation in the 1960s.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hmm, such throwaway journalism is hard to reconcile with a mountain of historical documentation. Mr. Woodruff is known to have urged Atlanta politicians to testify on behalf of the 1964 civil rights act. He used his clout to push a reluctant business community to embrace Martin Luther King Jr. And he was famous for railing against Jim Crow at every opportunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And it seems peculiarly cavalier to blame Coke, when it was trying to integrate its sales force, for the racist behavior of Southern bottlers who were, after all, independent businessmen. He might as well dub Branch Rickey racist for sending Jackie Robinson out to suffer abuse at the hands of racist Dodger fans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In an earlier article, the magazine celebrated Cyrus Mehri, the lawyer in the Coke case, because he \"unearthed tapes of Texaco managers making racist comments in meetings and leaked them to the New York Times.\" But what Mr. Mehri really leaked was a transcript that falsely accused a Texaco executive of uttering the word \"nigger.\" The word on the tape turned out to be \"Nicholas.\" Texaco, all the while pleading it had done nothing wrong, nevertheless paid $176 million to make the headlines go away.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Wall Street doesn't care about rights and wrongs, though, and the demand for Coke to settle the current lawsuit has become intense too. We'll probably never know how the allegations of present-day discrimination would have stood up in court. All the more reason, then, for journalists to evince some skepticism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Mehri's latest smoking gun is Coke's own effort to assess and address the frustrations of black employees, initiated by then-president Doug Ivester. Mr. Mehri seems to believe all big corporations are intrinsically racist, so any evidence of them attending to racial matters is ipso facto evidence of racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In fact, we've learned a few things after 30 years of affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The lawsuit, echoing Coke's internal review, complains that blacks are concentrated in human resources and public affairs rather than \"revenue generating areas.\" History obviously plays a role here. A lot of companies put blacks where they would be visible to fellow employees and the outside world. But the subsequent \"clustering\" phenomenon has become a subject of thoughtful academic investigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As Harvard's Rosabeth Kanter pointed out long ago in a pioneering study of corporate women, when you arrive as a new recruit and look around and see nobody who looks like you, it's not a happy moment for most people. Those who follow in the same department are spared the trials of tokenism. Relax, experiment, work in spurts -- they are freer to do all the things that effective people do, rather than trying to seem perpetually busy, as people do who are under a microscope.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What's more, workers tend to recruit others like themselves through personal connections, exactly what students of diversity say is a good way to set the ball rolling toward organizational change.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At Coke, critics also fasten on the fact that, as noted by Coke's own internal review, scattered blacks felt the need to create informal networks for \"sanity checks.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet such groups are precisely what diversity experts recommend. Indeed, Coke may have gone too far recently in trying to officially sponsor such groups. One thing we've learned is the importance of informal networks to share information on how to get along and succeed. Everything isn't in the employee handbook.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Guess what? Hiring people isn't the same as truly integrating them. Outsiders like to imagine corporations as all-powerful authoritarian institutions that can decree changes in social reality. In fact companies can't do for employees what they must do for themselves. Sociologists have even coined the term \"social trap\" for the problems of tokenism and stigmatization that arise from clumsy corporate attempts at affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But at least companies have shown a propensity to learn. Diversity is fact of life, like the weather and fluctuating government policy, which must be managed. Hence the new popularity of \"diversity management\" or the fine science of bending over backward to be fair to minorities without being unfair to others.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Had the Texaco tapes fallen into competent journalistic hands, they would have told a story of a company in the throes of downsizing (the subject of most of the conversations on the tapes) but still wrestling with the need to recruit and promote minorities and women.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Coke's huge financial success over the last decade was due to the consolidation of its bottlers, but this also spawned an army of redundant staffers at headquarters to serve a dwindling bottler retinue. As the Atlanta Constitution reported, the joke around Coke's campus was that you would only have to work three months a year if you could just locate the other three people who are already doing your job.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Such companies, by definition, clog the pathways of upward advancement -- lo and behold, a key complaint in the bias lawsuit. This is another reason the case has become a media feast. In keeping with eternal corporate dynamic, Coke recently tried to undo a decade's worth of bloat by laying off 40% of its headquarters staff. Overnight, hundreds of employees discovered they had a grievance just as Mr. Mehri was fishing for class-action status.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But don't expect journalists to set black frustration at Coke into a larger context of employee frustration. When it comes to racial matters, their greatest fear is that somebody might catch them writing a complicated truth and interpret it as \"racist.\"</p>\n"}

Oh, it hasn't happened yet, but you can see the state legislatures scrambling to undo civil rights legislation as we speak.

If it is challenged and the case reaches the Supreme Court, would the court apply the same rationale to Title IX as it did with the Roe v. Wade repeal for the sake of consistency? If so, Title IX could be in serious jeopardy. It would be horrible to see Title IX fall, but, based on the rationale for overturning Roe v.

But the average Black man in America lives about five fewer years than the average white man. A newborn Black boy in Washington, D.C., has a shorter life expectancy than a newborn boy in India.One of the challenges for those of us in journalism is to do a better job highlighting these inequities that don't come with a viral video.Since Floyd's death, we've focused on racial inequities in the criminal justice system, and it has been easy for liberal white Americans -- my tribe -- to feel indignant and righteous while blaming others. But in some areas, such as an unjust education system, we are part of the problem.At the very time that America was having a racial reckoning about criminal justice, Democratic states were closing in-person schooling in ways that particularly harmed nonwhite students. Race gaps increased, according to research by McKinsey & Company, and a Federal Reserve study suggests that higher dropout rates for marginalized students will have long-term consequences.More broadly, we in the United States embrace a public education system based on local financing that ensures that poor kids go to poor schools and rich kids to rich schools.Yes, it's a \"public\" school system with \"free\" education. So anyone who can afford a typical home in Palo Alto, Calif., costing $3.2 million, can then send children to superb schools. And less than 2 percent of Palo Alto's population is Black.Rucker Johnson, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that since 1988, American public schools have become more racially segregated. Roughly 15 percent of Black and Hispanic students attend so-called apartheid schools with fewer than 1 percent white students.In 1973, the Supreme Court came a whisker from overturning this system of unequal school funding, in the case of Rodriguez v. San Antonio Independent School District. Lower courts had ruled that profoundly unequal school funding violated the Constitution, but by a 5-to-4 vote the justices disagreed.This was the Brown v. Board of Education case that went the other way. If a single justice had switched, America would today be a fairer and more equitable nation.Educated white Americans are now repulsed at the thought of systems of separate and unequal drinking fountains for Black Americans but seem comfortable with a Jim Crow financing system resulting in unequal schools for Black children -- even though schools are far more consequential than water fountains.Perhaps that's because we and our children have a stake in this unequal system. Similarly, we accept that elite universities offer legacy preferences that amount to affirmative action for highly privileged children, with bonus consideration for big donors. This is one reason some universities have more students from the richest 1 percent than from the poorest 60 percent.Likewise, wealthy white Americans benefit from single-family zoning laws in the suburbs around those fine \"public\" schools. The effect of this zoning is to freeze out low-income families and keep neighborhoods more segregated.Then there's our skewed tax system: The I.R.S. is more likely to audit impoverished Americans who use the earned-income tax credit and typically earn less than $20,000 than it is to audit people earning $400,000. The county in the United States with the highest audit rate, according to ProPublica, is Humphreys County, Miss., which is impoverished and three-quarters Black.So how do we address these root inequities?We don't have perfect solutions, but many programs promote opportunity and reduce race gaps over time. The time to start is early childhood, with home visiting, quality child care and pre-K. Baby bonds can reduce wealth gaps, and child tax credits cut child poverty. Job training and a higher minimum wage can help families. Many of these elements are in President Biden's three-part proposal to invest in America and Americans, with the goal of reducing child poverty in America by half.One paradox is that while liberals often advocate such measures as ways to reduce racial inequality, polling suggests that this framing actually reduces public support. The best way to win support for these progressive policies, research suggests, is to frame them as reducing class gaps, not race gaps.Back in the early 2000s, white Americans sometimes said in polls that antiwhite bias was a bigger problem than anti-Black bias. That was delusional, and the tumult following the Floyd case increased the share of whites who acknowledge that discrimination persists.So the Floyd case may represent a milestone of progress in criminal justice.

{"id": "txt/1667204395.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Divestment isn'the answer</h2<p>Campaigns urging colleges and universities to divest stock holdings are again on the rise, focused today more often than not on holdings in fossil fuel companies. Many of the arguments against divestment as a general tactic are by now well known. They include practical ones, such as the difficulty of divesting fully when portfolios contain index funds, hedge funds and other complex instruments; concerns about adverse effects on the ability of endowments to support education and research as fully as they could if they were unconstrained; and doubts about the effectiveness of divestment in bringing about changes (which are often unspecified) in corporate practice. In general, I find these objections persuasive, though they need to be tested and debated in each situation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One argument in favor of divestment that I find entirely unpersuasive is the claim that a university is obligated to take a stand on any issue of broad social import that individuals - including, not infrequently, the president of a university acting in citizen mode! - regard as highly consequential. This is nonsense. To abstain is both a legitimate and appropriate action when the issue is not central to an institution's educational mission. Universities need to keep control over their agendas and decide for themselves when it is appropriate to take a position. An issue such as affirmative action - which directly affects educational processes and outcomes - has a very different claim on academia than does the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Taking an institutional stand on political issues of many kinds threatens the primary educational mission of the university, which is to be avowedly open to arguments of every kind and to avoid giving priority to partisan or other political viewpoints. The university should be the home of the critic - indeed, the home of critics of many different persuasions - not the critic itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But my main quarrel with current debates over divestment is that they pay too little attention, if any attention at all, to what I regard as the insidious moral perils of divestment. There is, first of all, the sometime hypocrisy of seeking institutional \"purity\" while failing individually to reduce consumption of fossil fuels or, for a faculty member, to divest one's personal stake in investment vehicles, including index funds, that contain questionable holdings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second, with regard to endowments, there is the question of an institution's obligation, seen as a matter of trust, to honor the intent of donors - many of whom surely gave money to endow specific activities, such as scholarships, believing that the institution would seek to earn as large a return as it prudently could.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Third, there is the very real danger that, as Macalester College President Brian Rosenberg has explained so well, joining the crowd in pushing for an institutional position on issues such as fossil fuels is too easy; it can tempt individuals to substitute such \"easy\" actions for their responsibility to act as citizens in pursuing more difficult courses of action, including working tirelessly in the political process. Of course, one can do both, but one wonders how often that happens.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, these are times when educational institutions need to work harder, in my view, to improve educational outcomes, especially for less-privileged students. A related obligation is to seek new ways of controlling educational costs to address affordability issues that will not be solved, I suspect, by increased governmental support. At the institutional level, there are only so many dollars to spend, and only so many hours in the day to work on issues of consequence. Well- intentioned but poorly conceived efforts to compel colleges and universities to fight extramural battles of all kinds can impair efforts to work harder on issues of great social as well as educational consequence that are at the core of the basic educational mission of higher education. Such trade-offs receive too little - and sometimes no - consideration. And there is a slippery slope to be considered - divesting for one purpose can make it harder for the institution to resist other calls to use divestment as a political tactic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Searching for answers to the question of how to make one's greatest contribution to the common good is anything but easy, for institutions or for individuals. But it should be at the forefront of our thinking - not an afterthought.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The writer is president emeritus of Princeton University and the Andrew W.

{"id": "txt/399053714.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Conservatism and the University Curriculum</h2<p>The political science departments at elite private universities such as Harvard and Yale, at leading small liberal arts colleges like Swarthmore and Williams, and at distinguished large public universities like the University of Maryland and the University of California, Berkeley, offer undergraduates a variety of courses on a range of topics. But one topic the undergraduates at these institutions -- and at the vast majority of other universities and colleges -- are unlikely to find covered is conservatism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is no legitimate intellectual justification for this omission. The exclusion of conservative ideas from the curriculum contravenes the requirements of a liberal education and an objective study of political science.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Political science departments are generally divided into the subfields of American politics, comparative politics, international relations, and political theory. Conservative ideas are relevant in all four, but the obvious areas within the political science discipline to teach about the great tradition of conservative ideas and thinkers are American politics and political theory. That rarely happens today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To be sure, a political science department may feature a course on American political thought that includes a few papers from \"The Federalist\" and some chapters from Alexis de Tocqueville's \"Democracy in America.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But most students will hear next to nothing about the conservative tradition in American politics that stretches from John Adams to Theodore Roosevelt to William F. Buckley Jr. to Milton Friedman to Ronald Reagan. This tradition emphasizes moral and intellectual excellence, worries that democratic practices and egalitarian norms will threaten individual liberty, attends to the claims of religion and the role it can play in educating citizens for liberty, and provides both a vigorous defense of free-market capitalism and a powerful critique of capitalism's relentless overturning of established ways. It also recognized early that communism represented an implacable enemy of freedom. And for 30 years it has been animated by a fascinating quarrel between traditionalists, libertarians and neoconservatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While ignoring conservatism, the political theory subfield regularly offers specialized courses in liberal theory and democratic theory; African-American political thought and feminist political theory; the social theory of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber and the neo-Marxist Frankfurt school; and numerous versions of postmodern political theory.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Students may encounter in various political theory courses an essay by the British historian and philosopher Michael Oakeshott, or a chapter from a book by the German-born American political philosopher Leo Strauss. But they will learn very little about the constellation of ideas and thinkers linked in many cases by a common concern with the dangers to liberty that stem from the excesses to which liberty and equality give rise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That constellation begins to come into focus at the end of the 18th century with Edmund Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France.\" It draws on the conservative side of the liberal tradition, particularly Adam Smith and David Hume and includes Tocqueville's great writings on democracy and aristocracy and John Stuart Mill's classical liberalism. It gets new life in the years following World War II from Friedrich Hayek's seminal writings on liberty and limited government and Russell Kirk's reconstruction of traditionalist conservatism. And it is elevated by Michael Oakeshott's eloquent reflections on the pervasive tendency in modern politics to substitute abstract reason for experience and historical knowledge, and by Leo Strauss's deft explorations of the dependence of liberty on moral and intellectual virtue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Without an introduction to the conservative tradition in America and the conservative dimensions of modern political philosophy, political science students are condemned to a substantially incomplete and seriously unbalanced knowledge of their subject. Courses on this tradition should be mandatory for students of politics; today they are not even an option at most American universities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When progressives, who dominate the academy, confront arguments about the need for the curriculum to give greater attention to conservative ideas, they often hear them as a demand for affirmative action. Usually they mishear. Certainly affirmative action for conservatives is a terrible idea.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Political science departments should not seek out professors with conservative political opinions. Nor should they lower scholarly standards. That approach would embrace the very assumption that has corrupted liberal education: that to study and teach particular political ideas one's identity is more important than the breadth and depth of one's knowledge and the rigor of one's thinking</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One need not be a Puritan to study and teach colonial American religious thought, an ancient Israelite to study and teach biblical thought, or a conservative or Republican to study and teach conservative ideas. Affirmative action in university hiring for political conservatives should be firmly rejected, certainly by conservatives and defenders of liberal education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To be sure, if political science departments were compelled to hire competent scholars to offer courses on conservative ideas and conservative thinkers, the result would be more faculty positions filled by political conservatives, since they and not progressives tend to take an interest in studying conservative thought. But there is no reason why scholars with progressive political opinions and who belong to the Democratic Party can not, out of a desire to understand American political history and modern political philosophy, study and teach conservatism in accordance with high intellectual standards. It would be good if they did.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It would also be good if every political science department offered a complementary course on the history of progressivism in America. This would discourage professors from conflating American political thought as a whole with progressivism, which they do in a variety of ways, starting with the questions they tend to ask and those they refuse to entertain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Incorporating courses on conservatism in the curriculum may, as students graduate, disperse, and pursue their lives, yield the political benefit of an increase in mutual understanding between left and right. In this way, reforming the curriculum could diminish the polarization that afflicts our political and intellectual classes. But that benefit is admittedly distant and speculative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the near term, giving conservative ideas their due will have the concrete and immediate benefit of advancing liberal education's proper and commendable goal, which is the formation of free and well-furnished minds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Berkowitz is a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By Peter Berkowitz</p>\n"}

He removed the current director of that effort, a bureau insider, and announced that the new manager would come from outside the F.B.I. Mr. Sessions also announced that henceforth, black and Hispanic agents would serve on the bureau's internal promotion boards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last year a Federal judge found the bureau guilty of gross discrimination against Hispanic agents. Earlier, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sustained one of several discrimination complaints filed by Donald Rochon, a black agent who had been the victim of a harassment campaign by white agents. Recently, F.B.I. recruiters were turned away from some campuses because of this pattern of discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Prompt and effective remedies are urgently in order. As Mr. Sessions' actions affirm, an agency in charge of enforcing the civil rights laws needs to be scrupulously sure that it also abides by them.</p>\n"}

Though opposition to this gesture has made strange bedfellows out of Jesse Jackson (who called it ''meaningless'') and Newt Gingrich (''a dead end''), Bill Clinton is already hedging about it, a few Congressmen are calling for reparations, and the debate could easily eat up the full year of the President's promised race initiative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Why not just cut to the chase, and have Strom Thurmond deliver the apology right now?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The bipartisan, all-white Congressmen sponsoring the apology mean well. But as Eric Foner, the Columbia University historian who wrote the definitive text on Reconstruction, says: ''At the end of the Civil War, the slaves didn't want an apology. They wanted substantive change in the way things were -- 'Give us some land, and you can keep the apology.' '' If Congress wants to apologize, it might start with its own transgressions, from Willie Horton-inspired campaign ads to its persistent inability to address the inner-city meltdown that is the most intractable legacy of slavery and its bastard offspring, segregation, today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But this would require substance, not symbolism, and when it comes to substance about race and poverty, both parties would rather play to the gallery. The G.O.P. focus on ending affirmative action is a hit in the polls, so never mind that the party with a Congressional majority has offered teachers-union bashing in lieu of action to deal with the root of all ills, failing schools in grades K-12. Nor have the Republicans found a plausible substitute for affirmative action that might win over the only three major figures in the party with credibility on race -- Colin Powell, Jack Kemp and the lone black Congressman, J. C. Watts -- all of whom favor a just reform of affirmative-action, not its abolition without a net for the poor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, has taken hits for what cynics regard as a public-relations racial policy: a call for a national conversation, the appointment of yet another blue-ribbon commission and town meetings that may fade as quickly as the volunteerism summit in Philadelphia. In fairness, he should be given the year he's asked for, and the benefit of the doubt. But you don't have to be cynical to have lots of doubts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Candid conversation about race -- as opposed to the P.C. homilies of Mr. Clinton's San Diego speech -- is easier decreed than had in a country that has already repressed memory of the stark racial gap revealed by the polar black and white reactions to both O. J. verdicts. As for actions, Mr. Clinton took seven months to fill the top job for civil-rights enforcement in his own Justice Department. At the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, there is now a backlog of 75,000 discrimination cases. And Mr. Clinton has little beyond rhetoric to offer the nation's cities, either.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No one doubts the President's empathy with African-Americans. But empathy won't get anyone a job, housing or education. ''The problem with Clinton,'' says Roger Wilkins, the author and Johnson Administration civil-rights official, ''is he's like somebody who says I owe you some money, and I really want to pay you, but I had to stop by the gambling casino on the way to your house.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since big-government schemes for addressing social welfare are politically taboo, Mr. Wilkins says that if he were President, he would have convened the country's best mayors to identify their ''biggest problems and biggest successes'' in dealing with the crises of race and poverty in their own cities. These mayors -- of all races and both parties -- are on the front lines; every day the most creative and committed of them are trying out ''real ideas'' on ''real people''; their proposals for replicating their successes nationally and for targeted Federal funding to help do so would have the credibility that Washington programs do not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the President we do have -- and his political adversaries -- seem inclined to deal with the abstract rather than the concrete. If a year from now there is nothing to show for their efforts but a repeal of affirmative action and a loftily written Presidential report, they will truly have something to apologize for.</p>\n"}

{"id": "txt/1652232593.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Best Way to Address Campus Rape</h2<p>THE campus rape debate took another hairpin turn last week when The Daily Beast published an interview with Paul Nungesser, the Columbia student accused of raping a fellow student, Emma Sulkowicz. She has been carrying a mattress around the campus to raise awareness about sexual assault and to protest the school's failure to expel Mr. Nungesser, who was cleared by a campus tribunal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The article raised questions about her story; among other things, it included screen shots from Mr. Nungesser's Facebook account showing that he and Ms. Sulkowicz had traded mutually affectionate messages for weeks after the incident in question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In response, the Columbia Daily Spectator published two columns wondering whether the paper had been too quick to assume Mr. Nungesser's guilt. Ms. Sulkowicz's supporters and some bloggers denounced The Daily Beast for conducting a trial by media and for posting the Facebook pages, which they said added nothing to the story unless you believed that a rape survivor who didn't behave like the perfect victim had to be a liar.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the media has reason to retry the case. Ms. Sulkowicz herself sought out the media when Columbia exonerated Mr. Nungesser. And the media made Ms. Sulkowicz so well known as a rape survivor that Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, invited her to the State of the Union address and publicly declared that she had received \"no justice.\" Very few people, and almost no one in the media, thought to question that assertion, because everyone knows, just knows, that you can't trust a campus sexual assault proceeding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What explains the nearly universal lack of confidence in these proceedings? Universities share some of the blame, but there's another culprit too: the United States government. People often wonder why college administrators try to adjudicate these fiendishly difficult cases, rather than putting them in the hands of the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The reason is that the Department of Education has very forcefully told schools to handle sexual grievances themselves and given them very detailed instructions about how to do so. A report last year from a White House task force on campus sexual assault underscored the importance to a university of following that advice. Even though the D.O.E.'s instructions are presented as recommendations rather than law, its Office for Civil Rights can put any school that fails to follow them on the list of colleges under investigation and even take away its federal funding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's no doubt that on many occasions colleges have not treated sexual-assault accusations as seriously as they should have. Nor did they do enough to ensure that women felt completely safe on campus. But in the past half-decade, the civil rights office has tried so hard to correct that problem that it is now forcing schools to go too far in the other direction, which has made campus procedures seem even less credible. Schools are being told to disregard what most Americans think of as the basic civil rights of a person accused of a heinous act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among other things, schools have to determine guilt on the basis of a \"preponderance of\" rather than \"clear and convincing\" evidence -- that is, on a 51 percent likelihood that the man did it, rather than a 75 percent one. (In these cases, the accused is almost always a man, although the accuser is by no means always a woman.) Neither party is allowed to cross-examine the other, lest direct questioning re-traumatize a victim. Schools must resolve cases swiftly -- the original requirement was 60 days, though the latest guidelines leave out the number and simply stress the need for a prompt resolution -- even if a criminal investigation is going forward at a slower pace.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That puts a student who wants to defend himself at risk of saying things that could later be used against him in court -- and at many schools, he's not even allowed to let a lawyer speak for him. At least 30 male students, some of whom were suspended or expelled for sexual misconduct, have filed suits against their universities, claiming that the process was unfair.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What should universities do to convince the world that they're fit to deal with campus rape? First, they should band together and demand that the government rethink its guidelines, especially those that flout the key tenets of due process. Second, they should ask the Office for Civil Rights to clarify its notion of sexual misconduct, now left to each school to define. Is it rape if a man fails to get affirmative consent at every stage of a sexual interaction, or only if he ignores a spoken objection? If a man and a woman are equally drunk, should he be found guilty of assaulting her because she was too intoxicated to agree to sex, even though he himself may have been too drunk to know that? (Right now, at most schools, he would be considered guilty.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Third, universities should insist that determinations of guilt or innocence rely on a \"reasonable-person test,\" according to which the accused is only culpable if a reasonable person would have considered his actions to be wrong. Without that standard, his fate may rest on her subjective judgment -- if she feels that he imposed unwanted sexual contact on her, no matter what he actually did, then he can be found to have harassed or raped her. (Harvard's controversial new policy leaves out the reasonable-person standard, which is partly why 28 of its law professors have publicly objected to it.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The fourth step, however, may be the most important. Though schools have the right to uphold their own standards of conduct, the government is currently scaring them into creating big, expensive bureaucracies and designing unduly cumbersome policies. Meanwhile, there are many more 18- to 25-year-old rape victims outside the walls of colleges than inside them. The smarter and more public-spirited thing for schools to do would be to divert at least some of their time and energy to forming partnerships with local law enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is widely believed that the police are insensitive to rape victims. Universities, on the whole, have a great deal of clout in their communities; they also possess considerable intellectual resources. They could be helping policemen and prosecutors do a better job with sexual violence cases instead of squandering money and good will on their own all-too-easily second-guessed shadow justice systems.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>JUDITH SHULEVITZ   Judith Shulevitz is the author of \"The Sabbath World: Glimpses of a Different Order of Time.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Columbia University, On Friday.

Sen. Hatch, the GOP chairman, is investigating the leak of Democratic strategy memos on President Bush's blocked nominees to the federal appeals courts. The staff memos document the extraordinary influence of liberal special-interest groups on Democratic members of Judiciary. The Journal published excerpts on Nov. 14.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Before I continue the tale of the unfortunate non-leaker, let me say a word about the memos themselves. If you haven't been reading this page, chances are you haven't heard of them. They are the talk of Capitol Hill, but virtually every mainstream media outfit -- the Washington Times being an exception -- has declined to inform readers about what's in them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Somehow it's impossible to imagine such media nonchalance had the memos come from GOP staffers recounting, say, Pfizer's game plan for how senators could get a Medicare prescription drug benefit passed. Proof of GOP collusion with big business would lead the news for days.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But evidence of how liberal interest groups are colluding with Democrats to decide which judges get through and which don't doesn't qualify as \"news.\" Instead, the press has been only too happy to help the Democrats change the subject from the substance of the memos to the nonissue of how they ended up on the editorial page of the Journal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So let's review. The memos -- from 2001-02 when the Democrats controlled Judiciary under the chairmanship of Sen. Patrick Leahy -- show the senators took their marching orders from People for the American Way, the Alliance for Justice, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the NAACP. No surprise here, as anyone who's been following the course of Mr. Bush's stalled nominees knows full well. But the extent of the groups' micromanagement is eye-popping and exposes the opposition to Mr. Bush's judicial picks for what it really is: political maneuvering, not principled differences of opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most blatant example is Miguel Estrada, Mr. Bush's former nominee for the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. \"The groups\" object to Mr. Estrada \"because he has a minimal paper trail, he is Latino, and the White House seems to be grooming him for a Supreme Court appointment,\" a Nov. 7, 2001, memo to Sen. Dick Durbin explains. Or, as talking points prepared for Sen. Ted Kennedy put it: \"We can't repeat the mistake we made with Clarence Thomas.\" Mr. Estrada withdrew his name from consideration in September, after seven attempts to bring his name to a floor vote failed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And then there's the Sixth Circuit, where Democrats were asked to delay nominees not because they weren't qualified but because their confirmation might influence the outcome of a particular case. Talk about politicalization of the judiciary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Five nominations -- all for slots designated judicial emergencies -- were pending on April 17, 2002, when a memo explained that Elaine Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund wanted Sen. Kennedy to \"hold off\" on any nominee until the Sixth Circuit voted on the U-Michigan affirmative action case. To quote: \"The thinking is that the current 6th Circuit will sustain the affirmative action program, but if a new judge with conservative views is confirmed before the case is decided, that new judge will be able, under 6th Circuit rules, to review the case and vote on it.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now back to the accused staffer. The excerpts from the memos appeared in the Journal on a Friday. By Monday, Democrats had succeeded in turning the spotlight away from the memos and onto the leaks. In this, they had the help of two unlikely allies: Chairman Hatch and Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist. Sen. Frist knew the Medicare bill was coming up for debate that week and, as one Republican insider explains, he wanted \"to keep the partisanship down.\" Remember -- this is the GOP leadership's response to Democratic memos containing such niceties as \"most of Bush's nominees are nazis.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By Sunday night, Nov. 16, the two GOP leaders authorized the Capitol Police to secure the committee's server room and obtain backup copies of the computer tapes on which staffers' files were kept. Over the next week two federal prosecutors conducted interviews of 50 committee staffers. Then, just before Thanksgiving, Mr. Hatch announced that he was putting an unnamed GOP staffer on administrative leave \"pending the outcome of the full investigation.\" The next step is for forensic computer experts to evaluate the tapes. The total cost of placating the Democrats is expected to add up to $500,000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A statement put out last week by Mr. Hatch's office says that the accused staffer \"improperly accessed at least some of the documents referenced in the media reports.\" That accusation bears scrutiny in light of how the committee's computer system is organized: Until Nov. 16, all Judiciary staffers used the same computer server and had access to a shared drive, a system put in place when Sen. Leahy took over as chairman in 2001 and hired his own IT staff.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Leahy techies neglected to put up a firewall between the GOP and Democratic staff, making it possible for all staffers to read everything posted on the shared drive. No one hacked into anyone's private files. These are, in effect, Leahy leaks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So why is the hapless staffer being hounded? And why is no one reporting the much bigger story of the memos?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Kirkpatrick is the Journal's associate editorial page editor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Partisan Wrangles\" -- WSJ Dec. 9, 2003)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: A Violation of Trust by Judiciary Panel Staffers\" -- WSJ Dec. 15, 2003)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor:A Violation of Clear Thinking by the Senator\" -- WSJ Dec. 18, 2003)</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1799136984.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Court Decides, and Doesn't: Affirmative Action Survives, Again</h2<p>Over the past four decades, the Supreme Court has repeatedly changeressed the question of whether public universities may consider an applicant's race in admissions decisions. Its answer, with some important caveats, has always been yes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was wise to reaffirm this principle on Thursday, ruling 4 to 3 in favor of an admissions process at the University of Texas at Austin that weighs race as one of many factors in filling some spots in its first-year class. The decision was the strongest reaffirmation of the constitutionality of a race-conscious approach in more than a decade, and should be the defining judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The court has acknowledged over and over that universities have a compelling interest in achieving the social and educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body. But that precedent has remained under constant attack. The current case was brought by Abigail Fisher, a white woman who was denied admission in 2008 and argued that the university violated the Constitution's equal protection clause by discriminating against white applicants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The University of Texas uses two separate methods to achieve greater diversity: First, it automatically offers roughly three-quarters of its spots to students who graduated in the top 10 percent of every high school in the state. (This helps increase diversity because so many Texas high schools are either overwhelmingly white or minority.) The remaining quarter is filled using a \"holistic\" process that considers various factors, including an applicant's leadership qualities, talents, socioeconomic status and race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, rejected Ms. Fisher's arguments and said, \"Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But Justice Kennedy cautioned that a university's goals \"must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them,\" and that officials must continue to monitor and change those policies if necessary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Only seven justices participated in the ruling. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself because of her prior involvement in the litigation as solicitor general; Justice Antonin Scalia, who heard oral arguments in the case in December, died in February.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The court considered Texas' holistic approach once before, in 2013, but declined then to rule on its constitutionality. Instead, it sent the case back to the federal appeals court to examine more closely the university's rationale for considering race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That type of examination is exactly what the university did, in providing data showing that race-neutral policies were inadequate in achieving a diverse student body, and that the holistic approach made a significant difference. In fact, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, the university has been adjusting its use of race in admissions for 20 years. It developed its current approach in direct response to a 2003 Supreme Court ruling upholding the same process at the University of Michigan law school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some justices continue to reject any consideration of race in college admissions. Justice Clarence Thomas dismissed the idea that students benefit from a racially diverse learning environment as a \"fchangeish theory.\" Justice Samuel Alito spent 50 pages -- more than twice the length of the majority opinion -- disputing every rationale offered by the university and its supporters. \"This is affirmative action gone wild,\" he wrote, and argued that the top 10 percent plan produced enough diversity on its own.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But that plan, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a dissent from the 2013 decision, is itself race conscious, since it relies on the existing and extreme segregation of Texas high schools. The holistic approach, on the other hand, considers race as a \"factor of a factor of a factor of a factor.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some insist simplistically that America is already a colorblind society or, even more perversely, that ending race-conscious policies would lead the way to such a society. Fortunately, Justice Kennedy, who has long  been a strong skeptic of affirmative-action programs, rejected that view. His vote in the Fisher case assures that universities will continue to have the right to shape their student bodies in a way that better reflects today's America.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: THE EDITORIAL BOARD</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Drawing (Drawing by Lisk Feng)</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2444131672.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Ruth Bader Ginsburg was all I wanted to be</h2<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was in my late 20s, attending a conference for women lawyers in the 1970s. I sat in the front row of a large auditorium for the keynote address. The speaker was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the founder of the American Civil Liberties Union Women's Rights Project. I was mesmerized.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>She was all that I wanted to be. To devote one's life to the fight for civil rights, to use legal skills to effect justice, better yet to make a difference \u2014 I could think of nothing greater. And I was not alone; generations of civil rights lawyers looked to emulate her.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ginsburg's vision of gender equality was decades ahead of her time. It went beyond just empowering women to compete for \"men's\" roles. While stereotypes distorted women's view of what was possible, they also impeded men, no less trapped in gender-based assumptions. Equality meant that both sexes should be free to assume all of society's roles without preconceptions. My son can be a caregiver; my daughter can be an executive. When the school administrators wanted Ginsburg to come to school to discuss her son's misconduct, she famously said, \"This child has two parents.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Her record as an advocate before the Supreme Court was outstanding; she argued six cases before the court, winning five. If she had done nothing else in her life, that alone would have been an extraordinary legacy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While she continued to be animated by her life's passion for equality when she joined the court, she was not the \"activist\" caricature some in the media have portrayed her to be. She was anxious to avoid upending precedent, determined to be respectful of the opinions of her colleagues. She believed in incremental legal change and emphasized the limited role that a court plays in a constitutional democracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In Ginsburg's understanding, courts have a critical role to play in identifying new understandings of the Constitution, but they must do so by \"measured motions.\" They are part of a dialogue with other organs of government and with the people as well. She was critical of the reasoning in Roe v. Wade, because it had accomplished too much too soon. She was, as the New York Times's Linda Greenhouse described at the time of her confirmation, a \"judicial-restraint liberal.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>She would apply the court's precedents but take pains to situate them in their social and historical context. A Ginsburg decision would tirelessly recount the history of gender-based classifications, the \"stunningly anachronistic\" generalizations about men and women, as she described them, that were embedded in the law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When, shortly after she joined the court, she wrote the majority opinion requiring that women be admitted to the all-male Virginia Military Institute, her analysis was classic Ginsburg: a lengthy description of the school, its prestige, its role in preparing men and only men for high-status roles in government and industry. In cases challenging affirmative action programs, she would recite the data that showed the persistence of racial inequity in housing, education and employment, the lingering effects of \"centuries of law-sanctioned inequality.\" She prefigured today's debate about systemic discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ginsburg brought her own experiences to bear, insisting that legal rules be understood in \"the realities of the workplace,\" a reality she understood well. When a Supreme Court majority rejected Lilly Ledbetter's pay discrimination claim because she had sued too late, Ginsburg dissented, teaching her colleagues about how pay discrimination, unlike discrimination in promotions or hiring, was hidden from view; Ledbetter sued as soon as she found out about it. Goodwin Liu, a justice on the California Supreme Court and a former Ginsburg clerk, has said that when Ginsburg was recounting Ledbetter's story, she was also telling her own.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Her judicial influence has to be measured not simply in the decisions she authored, but also in the decisions of her colleagues and lower-court judges, I among them. It extends to areas far beyond gender and race discrimination, including cases about access to justice, disability discrimination, the right to counsel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ginsburg was a reluctant dissenter, concerned about the moral weight of a decision when the court did not speak in a single voice. But in recent years, her role changed with the court's shifting membership. She dissented more and more \u2014 when the majority gutted the Voting Rights Act or enabled businesses to opt out of contraceptive coverage for employees based on a broad religion-based exemption. She dissented when the majority spoke paternalistically about women who felt compelled to end a pregnancy in the second trimester.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 2013, years after that conference at which I first heard her speak, I gave the Ruth Bader Ginsburg address at the New York City Bar Association. The justice introduced me, with an unforgettable sense of humor and warmth. Afterward, she sent me a gift, not a fancy academic treatise, but a signed book of her late husband's recipes, with a moving note. If I published my talk, she wanted to make certain that I included the story about Sadie, my mother. That story? Even though I had graduated Yale Law School, Sadie wanted me to take the Triborough Bridge toll taker's test \u2013 just in case!</p>\n"}

And Nov. 3, he was elected the first Latino lieutenant governor in 128 years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Next came Antonio Villaraigosa, a liberal Democrat and onetime street kid from East L.A. Last February, he succeeded Bustamante as speaker and, in 2001, may run for L.A. mayor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now comes Rod Pacheco from Riverside, the latest Latino to move up in legislative leadership and into the hierarchy of California politics. He's different, however. He's a Republican Latino, a rarity in partisan politics, at least until recently.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After getting pounded in the election--losing a net five seats--Assembly Republicans selected Pacheco as their new leader, the first-ever Latino to lead the GOP in the lower house. In fact, when Pacheco arrived in Sacramento just two years ago, he was the first Republican Latino lawmaker in 115 years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's the latest sign of growing Latino political clout--to the point, now, that even Republican Latinos are getting elected to partisan office. Three more GOP Latinos won Assembly races Nov. 3, quadrupling their seats.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In all, one in five members of the next Legislature will be Latino--24 total, up from 18 last session. There'll be 17 in the Assembly, seven in the Senate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And for the GOP, Pacheco's rise, plus the three new Latino lawmakers, are among the few bright spots that have emerged from a disastrous election.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Republican party is desperate for credible messengers who can persuade Latino voters they shouldn't keep blaming the GOP for Gov. Pete Wilson's fiery crusades against affirmative action and illegal immigration, his doomsday TV ads warning that \"they keep coming.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Consequently, there's considerable rooting for Pacheco within the party. The new minority leader still is an unknown--he has been a legislator only two years and nobody knows whether he can lead--but already there's speculation about a future statewide candidacy. For attorney general? Governor?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He's only 40. He's a former prosecutor who didn't lose a case in 10 years and sent five murderers to death row. He's a centrist who supports abortion rights and opposed Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative. But he backed Prop. 209 to end state racial preferences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pacheco's the kind of fiscally conservative, crime-fighting, social moderate who just might appeal to voters statewide. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, he pleads.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Folks have said stuff like that to me,\" Pacheco says. \"But you know how this place is: Every {legislative} member gets that--120 legislators wake up in the morning and see the next governor. That's partly their own ambition and partly everybody slapping them on the back.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"No. 2, I'm not sure that's my future. I live by the motto, 'Man makes plans and God laughs.' \"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pacheco believes Latinos can be drawn to the Republican party because of common views about safer streets, family values, lower taxes, less regulation and better schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But if the GOP wants to use him as a party recruiter of Latinos, he's uncomfortable with that. \"I don't think it's my role to carry the banner,\" he says. \"That's up to the party. My best role is just to go about my business and folks may be encouraged by the fact I'm the Republican leader.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like most Latinos, Pacheco says, he opposed Prop. 187 because it targeted schoolchildren and was promoted in a harsh tone. There was some logic to eliminating public services for illegal immigrants, he explains, but \"I equate it to my days as a trial lawyer: Emotion moves people faster than logic. If I perceive I'm being attacked personally, I'm going to have difficulty relating to you in a rational and logical way.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Heading into the next legislative session, the deck's stacked against Pacheco and Republicans. They're down 48-32 in the Assembly and 25-15 in the Senate, with a Democratic governor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, he says, \"We need to be assertive. There's the possibility Democrats could be giddy with the elections and think we're irrelevant. But we won't be irrelevant because any bill {requiring a two-thirds vote} will need Republicans. I didn't come here to fight. I could have stayed in the DA's office and fought. But if Democrats don't reach across the aisle, we're probably going to fight more often than not.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Democrat he'll be fighting with the most is another Latino, Speaker Villaraigosa. And that's a healthy sign for political diversity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's a new era in California politics--more moderate and more Latino. As for Republican Latinos, the GOP can only hope \"they keep coming.\"</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/419493718.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Attacks show need for diversity</h2<p>SPECIAL SECTION. Education Today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The concept of diversity has taken on new meaning since Sept. 11.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Suddenly from a nation of atomized individuals we became a collective, in fear, mourning and awareness of having a common identity and perhaps a common fate as Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In that collective it suddenly seemed very important that we had many kinds of names and faces.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some of us began seeing faces we hadn't noticed before. Non- Muslims became aware of Muslims as people to be encountered in an emotional, almost intimate way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On college campuses students began flocking to classes on topics most hadn't much cared about before: Afghanistan, the Middle East, international relations, Islam, Arabic language.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Perhaps most important, Americans, in looking in each other's faces and hearing each other's prayers, sought a renewed faith that differences of color or religion or ethnic background don't have to lead to implacable enmity and mutual destruction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this context it is worth reconsidering the venerable arguments about whether furthering diversity on college campuses constitutes a compelling national interest to the extent that universities should consider race and ethnicity in their admissions policies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A series of conflicting court decisions in the last year have brought the debate over what is called the \"diversity rationale\" to a fever pitch, and the U.S. Supreme Court may have the final say. Different federal judges have ruled that race-conscious admissions policies are permissible to foster diversity for University of Michigan undergraduates, but not at the law school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Other jurists have decided that such policies are fitting at the University of Washington law school, but not for undergraduates at the University of Georgia.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Implementation of such policies is different at each school, and the varied techniques may have played some part in the decisions. But the arguments on both sides always come back to the issue of whether diversity is a compelling enough interest to warrant going beyond tests and numbers in the direction of race and ethnicity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The diversity rationale has taken the place of another accepted standard--remedying vestiges of past racial discrimination--because past bias is hard to pin down, especially outside the South. Diversity as a positive educational goal, beneficial to all students in an institution, makes a more compelling case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The issue is of immediate importance only in flagship public universities throughout the country, as other state schools generally admit the vast majority of applicants. Private schools, however, might be held to whatever standard is finally applied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Going to the right college, or to a top law or business or medical school, means a lot in this country. Not everything, fortunately, but still a lot.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's tempting to insist that merit, determined by the test scores and grades, should be the only admission standard. We are all equal before the numbers, which are blind to color, gender and ethnicity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But merit obviously takes many forms, and numbers themselves can be relative. Is a 1300 SAT score by a New Trier student from a wealthy family really more meritorious than an 1100 by a low-income teenager from the South Side?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Clearly there is some lower limit on capability: Students must be able to do the work. And some studies show comparatively high dropout rates for students admitted to selective schools through affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But there also is evidence that such students actually do better at top schools than their counterparts (for instance, black students with similar test scores) at less-selective schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The crucial question is whether, in a world in which pluralistic values suddenly seem so important, the top schools can afford to cut minority admissions. One landmark study says a race-blind policy could slice the number of black students at these schools to as little as a quarter of the current total.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor said in the aftermath of Sept. 11 that she has given the issue a lot of thought.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"How does one see that we're not all the same, that we haven't traveled the same path and that we have to be able to see the world from the other person's eyes? That for me is at the center of why I believe so firmly that higher education has to be diverse,\" she said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"We don't naturally come to see other sides; we need to learn how to do that, we need to have the social context and the learning context where we can get outside of ourselves.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the weeks after Sept. 11, students felt vulnerable and wanted to reach out to others without quite knowing how, she added. And of course there were ugly incidents, including a brawl in a campus bar after an attack on an Indian student.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"What I keep saying at events here is that it's terribly important in a crisis to see people as individuals and not as groups, not as a religion,\" she said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"For many of our students, college life is the first time they actually have a chance to live and work in a diverse environment.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Opponents of the diversity rationale say you can have stimulating, diverse ideas without a diverse student body. Not so. There is no substitute for that direct encounter with someone whose difference is a challenge to the heart and mind.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2445858352.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Breonna Taylor Deserved Justice</h2<p>No police officer will have to answer for her death. This never gets easier.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kentucky's attorney general, Daniel Cameron, announced Wednesday that one police officer would be charged, not in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, but with endangering her neighbors with reckless gunfire. \"If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice,\" Mr. Cameron said, in an apparent attempt to explain the lack of more serious charges relating to the 26-year-old's killing. \"Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Cameron's use of the term \"mob justice\" to characterize protests by African-Americans who want officers who kill Black people with seeming impunity held responsible for their actions is curious phrasing, particularly from an attorney general from a Southern state.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mob justice was literally used by Kentucky and other Southern states for decades to rule over Black people. Lynching and other racial terror tactics were deployed frequently, often with the help of the criminal justice system. Authorities were known to hand Black people to mobs who turned violence and spectacle into regional events. The news of an impending lynching would bring Southern white families to town squares on foot and by wagon. They arrived with picnic lunches and cameras to watch live examples of the devaluation of Black citizenship and the snuffing out of life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to Ben Tobin of the Louisville Courier-Journal, \"between 1877 and 1934, lynchings of at least 186 African Americans took place in KY.\" This was mob justice. This represented repeated failures of the criminal justice system. This was a willful shunning of the nation's basic principles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All Ms. Taylor's family wanted, and all many of the protesters wanted, is for the Constitution and the mechanism of justice to work for them the way it works for others. Mr. Cameron, who is Black, should know that to suggest that protesters are nothing but a mob dehumanizes the people calling for justice and respect. And it reminds African-Americans of the way we're so often unfairly portrayed as perpetrators of crime, and so rarely seen as victims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Police officers who kill citizens are rarely convicted. But in this tragic situation, in which the woman killed was not only unarmed but asleep in the moments before a police officer took her life, we hoped that for once, justice would be on our side. This is yet another disappointing reminder that it's not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These efforts take a cumulative toll. Young African-Americans consuming a regular diet of Black death are learning to not trust their government. It's painful to realize that kneeling for the national anthem can cost a football player like Colin Kaepernick his career, but a police officer firing a deadly shot into an innocent young woman's home late at night will face no consequences. Black people will try to make sense of this, try to rebuild whatever expectation of safety we can muster, and tap into coping mechanisms that are now so familiar. Preparing for moments like this feels like a futile job that can never really soften the actual experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In recent years various media outlets have invited people to share stories about when they first realized they were Black. Often, the realizations came from some negative experience with racial prejudice: The time a white childhood friend couldn't invite them to a sleepover, or when a favorite high school teacher told them affirmative action would get them into a great college. We've frequently read and heard about the talks Black parents have with their children, explaining how racism can make people misconstrue their behavior, and about how teens must learn the etiquette of negotiating racial animus. Don't talk back. Look down. Say yes ma'am and yes sir.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But what can prepare a person for the proper response to heavily armed cops in their home in the middle of the night? How could we have prepared Breonna Taylor? The answer is, we couldn't have. What could have prepared her family for the failure to hold the police officers in this case accountable? Nothing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have always known I was Black. I was raised in a segregated community, attended a racially segregated church, was bused across town to schools with more resources, watched \"Roots\" and \"Eyes on the Prize\" with my family and recited Margaret Walker poems in Black History Month programs. I was bathed in blackness from birth. I also knew fairly early on that not everyone viewed blackness through the same lens, and that I would be on the receiving end of racial hostility. I felt prepared for this eventuality. But when I was standing on High Street in front of Ohio State's campus and someone from a car full of white boys yelled a racial slur at me in broad daylight, with lots of people watching but not even acknowledging what happened, I learned there is never enough preparation. Not for the pugilistic ways that white supremacy can render you an afterthought of American democracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That experience has stayed with me for over 20 years. The realization that no police officer will face consequences for killing Breonna Taylor will stay with me, too.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's not that the failure to indict a police officer for killing Ms. Taylor was unpredictable. It's that the emotional and political exhaustion surrounding the news was predictable. This is what inspires the rage and despair that Mr. Cameron cruelly and ahistorically dismissed as \"mob justice.\" This is what forces Black people to push for this nation to be better stewards of its ideal, while recalibrating our expectations time and time again.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Melanye Price (@ProfMTP), a professor of political science at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, is the author, most recently, of \"The Race Whisperer: Barack Obama and the Political Uses of Race.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

{"id": "txt/399055159.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>How Jesse Helms Made a Difference</h2<p>If Ronald Reagan was the sunny and optimistic face of modern conservatism, the uncompromisingly defiant exemplar of it was Jesse Helms, who died yesterday at age 86.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While Reagan has undergone a revisionist makeover by many historians who now recognize his accomplishments, Helms is still the conservative liberals most love to hate. But while they still disdain his views, many liberal groups are now using their own forms of the rhetorical and campaign techniques that Helms honed to perfection.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Jesse Helms was an influential television commentator in North Carolina when he decided to leave the Democratic Party, winning a U.S. Senate seat as a Republican in 1972. He went on to win four more terms, with a reputation as the Senate's most principled warrior on behalf of social conservatism, anti-Communism, limits on union power, and an assertive foreign policy that rejected State Department caution. Like Reagan, many of his views appear to have been validated. Others, such as his blind spot on racial issues and mean-spirited comments against gays were troublesome, but even the stubborn Helms made moves to modify his image in those areas late in life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Two events early in his Senate career showcased Helms's unflinching nature and his political skills. In 1975, he engineered a visit to the U.S. by Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn over the objections of the State Department, which forbade its own employees from attending a major Solzhenitsyn speech in Washington. State also blocked a proposed visit to the White House, leading Helms to accuse President Gerald Ford of \"cowering timidly for fear of offending Communists.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That incident helped spur Reagan to challenge Ford for the GOP nomination the next year. Reagan lost the first five primaries, and he entered the North Carolina contest broke and under pressure to pull out. But Helms and his chief strategist Tom Ellis refused to give up. They employed Helms's huge, direct-mail list to build a grass-roots army of volunteers and raise money to air 30-minute speeches by Reagan across the state.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Emphasizing the Panama Canal \"giveaway\" and smaller government, Reagan won an upset victory and was able to battle Ford all the way to the GOP convention. He showed such strength at the convention that Ford invited him to deliver off-the-cuff remarks to the delegates. Reagan was so inspiring that some of Ford's own delegates exclaimed, \"We just nominated the wrong candidate.\" Reagan later acknowledged how Helms's intervention rescued his political career.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But that level of success eluded Helms in a Senate where he was almost always outvoted. Rather than seek compromise, he staked out firm positions that attracted publicity for his causes. He was often able to block appointments he considered too liberal and was the first to highlight United Nations corruption, an issue on which he was clearly ahead of his time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He also stumbled. His anticommunist fervor led him to back authoritarian regimes in Chile and Argentina far more than he should have. His 1983 opposition to a Martin Luther King holiday -- he railed against King's associations with communists -- was myopic and a throwback to a discredited past.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The issue of race will always cast a shadow on Helms's legacy. He could never understand why he was viewed by many as a bigot, having run one of the most integrated TV stations in the South and often hiring blacks on his staff. His criticisms of affirmative action and forced busing were on the mark. But as conservative scholar John Hood notes, \"he failed to marry every criticism of government overreaching with calls for the South's social and moral transformation and clear denunciations of racist business owners.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indeed, the mainstream media rarely put Helms's career in context the way they did, for example, with Sam Ervin, a Democrat who served with Helms in the Senate from North Carolina before retiring in 1975. Ervin was the leading legal strategist against Civil Rights legislation, and he largely crafted the Southern Manifesto against Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court case that ruled school segregation unconstitutional. But Ervin was the man who chaired the Watergate hearings that helped bring down Richard Nixon, and his views on civil rights were almost never mentioned. Both Helms and Ervin were courtly, principled conservatives. Only one became a cartoon media villain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Contrary to his reputation, Helms did change his mind. For his first decade in office he opposed aid to Israel and in 1982, after that nation invaded Lebanon, called for \"shutting down\" relations. But after learning more about Israel's security fears during a visit there in 1985, and receiving assurances that officials there could support some military sales to moderate Arab nations, he became Israel's stalwart ally. \"It was a complete switch,\" recalls Morris Amitay, former executive director of AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Helms also softened on both AIDS and Africa. He developed an unlikely friendship with the rock star Bono, who convinced Helms to back AIDS funding and alleviate poverty in Africa by channeling more foreign aid through private sources.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But that kind of detente was rare. Most liberals delighted in baiting Helms and he reciprocated: He crowed about how disappointed CBS anchor Dan Rather looked in announcing his upset victory on election night in 1990. But liberals did pay attention to Helms, and gradually adopted some of his methods.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was Helms who first sent his own foreign policy advisers overseas to second-guess the executive branch's foreign policy. Many liberals have no qualms in doing the same today. One liberal consultant told me he learned from Helms's ability to distill complicated ideas to a level that connected with ordinary people. His mastery of new media techniques and technology convinced many liberals they had to invest in the Internet and build up the passions of their base.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Jesse Helms was a major influence on American conservatism, but his career provides a blueprint for anyone who represents an embattled minority viewpoint. You can, with persistence and unflinching determination, change the political odds in your favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Fund is a columnist for WSJ.com.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/432763623.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Hernandez v. Brown</h2<p>Ian Haney Lopez, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, is the author of ''Racism on Trial: The Chicano Fight for Justice.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With commemorations from coast to coast to remind them, most Americans already know that this week was the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Unfortunately, what they don't realize is that the country missed an equally important anniversary two weeks ago, that of Hernandez v. Texas -- the perennially overshadowed antecedent to Brown that was decided on May 3, 1954.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That case merits commemoration not just because the Supreme Court used it to finally extend constitutional protection to Mexican-Americans, important though that is, especially now that Latinos are the largest minority group. It's worth celebrating because Hernandez got right something that Brown did not: the standard for when the Constitution should bar group-based discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hernandez involved jury discrimination, which the court had long prohibited. The question in Hernandez, unlike in Brown, was not whether the state's conduct was unconstitutional; it was whether the Constitution protected Mexican-Americans. But the dynamics of the case prevented the court from answering that question by reasoning that Mexican-Americans, like blacks, constituted a racial minority.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's because the political and social leaders of the Mexican-American community at that time argued for equality not on the ground that discrimination was wrong per se, but because they were white. Texas, in turn, harnessed this argument to its defense, pointing out that if Mexican-Americans were white, so too were the persons seated on Texas juries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because both sides insisted that Mexican-Americans were white, Hernandez v. Texas forced the court to confront directly a question it would sidestep in Brown: under precisely what circumstances did some groups deserve constitutional protection? Hernandez offered a concise answer: when groups suffer subordination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''Differences in race and color have defined easily identifiable groups which have at times required the aid of the courts in securing equal treatment under the laws,'' the court wrote. But, it said, ''other differences from the community norm may define other groups which need the same protection.'' Succor from state discrimination, the court reasoned, should apply to every group socially defined as different and, implicitly, as inferior. ''Whether such a group exists within a community is a question of fact,'' the court said, one that may be demonstrated ''by showing the attitude of the community.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How, then, did the Texas community where Hernandez arose regard Mexican-Americans? Here the court catalogued Jim Crow practices: business and community groups largely excluded Mexican-Americans; a local restaurant displayed a sign announcing ''No Mexicans Served''; children of Mexican descent were shunted into a segregated school and then forced out altogether after the fourth grade; on the county courthouse grounds there were two men's toilets, one unmarked and the other marked ''Colored Men'' and ''Hombres Aqui'' (''Men Here'').</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The same sort of caste system that oppressed blacks in Texas also harmed Mexican-Americans. But it was Jim Crow as group subordination, rather than as a set of ''racial'' distinctions, that called forth the Constitution's concern in Hernandez v. Texas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, Brown v. Board of Education also responded to group mistreatment. But the court did not state in sufficiently explicit terms that school segregation violated the Constitution because it constituted systematic oppression, rather than because it turned on race. This small lapse left open just enough space for the misreading of Brown that now dominates conservative thinking on antidiscrimination law -- including on the Supreme Court. Brown, the majority now contends, stands for the proposition that the Constitution opposes not noxious practices of oppression but instead only the state use of formal racial distinctions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The anti-caste commitment of Brown lies today distorted, and its efficacy as constitutional law largely eroded. Treating every official use of race as akin to racism, the Supreme Court erects virtually insurmountable constitutional hurdles against all race-conscious government action. No statement better captures this misguided equation of Jim Crow and affirmative action than Justice Clarence Thomas's assertion that there is ''a moral and constitutional equivalence between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the court protects from constitutional challenge situations in which racism operates powerfully but not explicitly. For example, even after conceding that Georgia sentenced to death blacks who killed whites 22 times more often than blacks who killed blacks, the court upheld Georgia's death penalty machinery. Under 14th Amendment law, any use of race encounters the same constitutional hostility; but systematic discrimination, if not expressly based on race, receives the Constitution's blessing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The current court reasons as if Brown held that it is race per se, rather than racism and maltreatment, that offends the Constitution. In this, Brown itself is partly to blame. Confident that the 14th Amendment protected blacks, Chief Justice Earl Warren in Brown did not expressly explain why this was so: not because they were a race, but because they were oppressed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Under the title ''What Brown v. Board of Education Should Have Said,'' Jack Balkin, a Yale law school professor, recently enlisted legal scholars to rewrite that decision in a manner that might have prevented the distortions that now mar constitutional antidiscrimination law. But the exercise is largely unnecessary. Chief Justice Warren already said what Brown should have. He did so two weeks earlier, in Hernandez v. Texas. After 50 years, the time has come for courts and scholars to install Hernandez where it belongs: at the center, with Brown, of a robust 14th Amendment law committed to ending racial subordination.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398441227.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Affirmative reaction</h2<p>Court cases percolate all over America, but California has staked out political leadership of the drive to take the spoils out of affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The efforts there are occurring on three fronts -- at the University of California, in the legislature and through the initiative process. None, however, is assured of success.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ward Connerly, a University of California regent who happens to be black and also a longtime friend of Gov. Pete Wilson, raised the issue of admissions quotas again last month, attracting considerable media attention. Mr. Connerly, who last year objected because some minority-group members apparently were \"admitted almost solely on the basis of race\" to the prestigious university's medical schools, this time widened his focus to the undergraduate enrollment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For the June regents meeting, he asked administrators to consider alternatives to race-based admissions and to review federal laws and regulations that may constrain the UC. Mr. Connerly's direction, however, is clear: He doesn't like masked forms of \"government redistribution that takes from one and gives to another.\" He wants, instead, to \"market\" the university to groups that are underrepresented in the student body and assist them in preparing for application. As far as race and sex are concerned, that'd be it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Connerly makes his living as a consultant to public agencies and other entities, especially those concerned with land use, which is what brought him and Mr. Wilson together when they both worked in the statehouse two decades ago. He says he has never used minority set-asides to get contracts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So far, Mr. Connerly's been a rather lonely voice on the regents. \"We need to put a little fiber in people who don't want to be perceived as racists or Uncle Toms,\" he says of his fellow board members, nearly all of them appointed by Republican governors. \"We're now at the point where the returns we're getting from this (preference policy) are little, but they come at a very high price.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That cost is the increasing bitterness of white and Asian-heritage students who find that merit isn't enough in what was long an objective process. On the other side, however, adamant defenders of quotas will spare nothing to defend their beachhead at the UC. In recent years, the legislature has passed mandates that the state universities admit in proportion with California's ethnic distribution. (They were vetoed.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Legislative politics on this issue may be changing, as bills to bar preferences in public-sector admissions, hiring and contracting now should get a fuller hearing. The main reason for this is the California Civil Rights Initiative, a constitutional amendment flatly outlawing quotas that looms for the 1996 ballot. The legislature, still controlled by Democrats, may wish to pass statutes that steal some of the initiative's thunder while mucking up its succinct clarity with lots of lawyer-like language. Still, the citizen measure's sponsors are willing to go as far in the Capitol as they can.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In all likelihood, they will have to proceed to collect 615,000 valid signatures for a ballot placement next year. While many are predicting a polarizing and victorious campaign that will change the agenda of both state and national races, the fact is that backers face a daunting task. They will need about $1 million to qualify, and then will be up against an opposition including businesses that rely on quotas for their income.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By contrast, supporters are cash poor. Major corporations will sit this one out, fearing a public-relations hit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The story of the failed California voucher campaign of 1993 is a reminder of how an underfunded proposal is susceptible to an expensive campaign of harassment and distortion. On the other hand, Proposition 187 this past fall, despite its faults, proved that an inherently popular, grass-roots drive (with gubernatorial support) can win against loud opposition. The Civil Rights Initiative has going for it, at least so far, the quiet support of many moderate Democrats who grasp what the racial wedge is now doing to their party and their society.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In sum, the California ferment stems from a bid to reclaim affirmative action's original standing: It is a way to boost those who need help competing on what is, at the point of competition, a level field. It's an attempt to pull the idea back from its current emphasis on institutional mandates and return the focus to where it belongs -- on individual achievement.</p>\n"}

So, consider the constitutionally dubious conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's three murderers for having committed \"hate crimes.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The criminal justice system has now correctly concluded that his murderers were racists whose racism manifested itself in their actions. This conclusion, however, does not justify complacency about deciding that because the killers' gross acts reflected grotesque thinking, the thinking merits its own punishment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The killers chased Arbery \u2014 a Black jogger in a White neighborhood \u2014 and killed him with a shotgun. For this violation of Georgia's law against murder, a state court sentenced them to life imprisonment. Then this week, they were convicted in a federal court of violating a federal law that punishes those who violate a person's civil rights \"because of\" their \"race, color,\" etc. For this they can again be sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But as Jacob Sullum, senior editor of Reason, notes: It is therefore \"equally true that the defendants were convicted 'because of' their benighted beliefs. Condemning them as bigots was the whole point of this exercise, since they had already been condemned (and punished) as murderers.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This misuse of judicial proceedings was, Sullum says, possible because of two regrettable Supreme Court conclusions: The killers' \"second, symbolic prosecution did not amount to double jeopardy, because the state and federal crimes, defined by two different 'sovereigns,' are not 'the same offense.'\" And prosecutions of hate crimes are deemed consistent with the First Amendment, even if they impose added punishment for speech that, however scabrous, is nevertheless constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, the government can conduct trials for the purpose of virtue signaling \u2014 to announce, however redundantly, that it condemns particular frames of mind. A bigot's shabby mental furniture is, however, not a crime. Were it, what other mentalities might government decide to stigmatize by imposing special punishments? Arbery's killers had expressed their racism in speech (texts, social media posts, remarks) that no jurisdiction can proscribe. But their federal punishment will be imposed precisely because their speech demonstrated their bigotry.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proving the intent behind a criminal act is crucial. And no principle should prohibit ever making punishment proportional to the motive for a criminal act. However, deciding that an actor's heinous behavior is made more heinous because they had a bad attitude is dangerous. It is one thing for the law to hold individuals responsible for controlling their minds, which presumably control their bodies. It is quite another thing for government to inventory an individual's mind for the purpose of declaring how admirable the government's mind is, and perhaps by doing so to improve the public's mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This impulse melds with what C.S. Lewis called the remedial theory of punishment, whereby government detains offenders until they are cured, as determined by government's \"official straighteners.\" Another totalitarian temptation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Only an engaged judiciary vigorously applying constitutional protections prevents the woke from greasing this nation's slide into something like Europe's increasingly minute supervision of speech \u2014 and of the mentalities speech reflects. The European Court of Human Rights says governments may \"sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred.\" By \"even prevent,\" the ECHR evidently extends permission for preemptive censorship and punishment. Based on what?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In today's America, \"hate speech\" has become an elastic concept stretched to encompass any expression of ideas \u2014 e.g., opposition to race-based affirmative action or saying marriage should be between a man and a woman \u2014 that offends any of the plethora of easily offended factions. So, various colleges and universities have proscribed speech that might \"annoy or otherwise inconvenience\" anyone, and certain \"attitudes,\" and \"verbal harm\" from injurious \"assumptions\" or \"implications.\" They have guaranteed \"freedom from indignity of any type\" and protection from \"patronizing remarks.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Congressional grandstanding includes the promiscuous multiplication of federal crimes, many of them duplicative of state crimes. From Congress's bottomless moral pork barrel comes proposals for niche hate crime legislation: The latest, the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, was signed into law May 20 last year.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Government is failing conspicuously at many basic things \u2014 budgeting, preserving the currency's value, maintaining infrastructure, educating children, etc. Surely government should economize its exertions by not conducting show trials for the purpose of highlighting \u2014 perhaps for the public's moral improvement \u2014 that it is offended by certain thinking that can precede certain behaviors that are already criminalized and forcefully punished.</p>\n"}

An authoritative voice warns ominously that the bad old days of political clout have returned to the police promotion process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All this because the city, in an effort to get more black and Hispanic sergeants and lieutenants, is going to base 30 percent of the next promotional draft on job performance, not just test scores.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then there's the moaning and wailing of the Chicago Fire Fighters Union, which in 32 months of contract negotiations resisted a similar method to get more black and Hispanic lieutenants, captains and battalion chiefs. Finally, union leaders agreed grudgingly to basing 10 percent of promotions on performance rather than test scores, but only when the city agreed to pay the salaries of the top three union officers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here's a union, 31 percent of whose members are black or Hispanic, holding out against Daley's efforts to promote an equitable number of blacks and Hispanics.

Here's a union that gives full voting rights to retired members, who are predominantly white, and barely gives the time of day to nearly a third of its active membership.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So it falls to the Daley administration to produce a police and fire service that reflects, if not mirrors, the racial and ethnic makeup of the entire city. And progress must be eked out in spite of the unions, not because of them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for black and Hispanic police and firefighters who complain the city is moving too slowly, it is they who need to gear up and get organized.

{"id": "txt/398469346.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>A GOP star becomes 'one of them'</h2<p>William Weld instantly became a shining star in the Republican firmament when he succeeded Michael Dukakis as governor of Massachusetts in 1990, proving that a Republican could indeed win in the most liberal of states. Since then, Gov. Weld has tried to become a beacon for those outside the party mainstream by combining fiscal conservatism (complete with a \"no new taxes\" pledge) with social libertarianism (he's to the left of Joycelyn Elders on abortion). Now Gov. Weld has taken his most ambitious steps toward marketing his vision of Republicanism nationally by backing the presidential campaign of California Gov. Pete Wilson.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But just as Gov. Weld tries to exert his influence beyond Massachusetts, he's losing his luster at home. Since winning reelection with more than 70% of the vote last fall, Gov. Weld has managed to alienate many of his core backers. In particular, many of the conservative Democrats who crossed party lines to support him -- the \"Weldocrats\" -- feel betrayed by a governor who reminds them more of Nelson Rockefeller than of Ronald Reagan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In December, Mr. Weld endured the most hostile public reaction of his career when he approved a thoroughly unpopular pay raise for state legislators. The Boston Herald filled page one with a derisive sketch of Mr. Weld as Santa, dropping presents down the State House chimney.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last month, Santa again sided with an unpopular special interest. State taxpayers are sick of the only-in-Massachusetts law which requires that off-duty cops be hired to oversee road work at twice the cost of regular flagmen. This mandate costs fiscally strapped cities and towns $100 million annually. But Mr. Weld ignored the mounting clamor for reform, saying, \"I'm with the cops on this one.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Barbara Anderson, a top antitax leader in the Bay State, has broken with Mr. Weld over such cave-ins. \"He's now become one of them,\" she says, \"sort of like the pod people.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indeed, the governor's credibility as a reformer has deteriorated to the point where the recent announcement of a new executive branch downsizing initiative was widely ridiculed as a publicity stunt. These days, Boston's radio talk shows are full of anti-Weld venom of the sort unheard since Mr. Dukakis left office. The governor's frequent out-of-town trips to raise funds for Mr. Wilson's campaign have become a local joke; one radio station even sent its morning team out in search of citizens who'd actually seen the governor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The ultimate insult to the Weldocrats came on June 17, when Mr. Weld delivered a ringing endorsement of the affirmative-action status quo to stunned parents at graduation ceremonies for Northeastern University, a commuter school favored by working-class whites. \"We don't discard [the taxation or defense-procurement systems] when we see an individual application we don't like . . . because we understand the systems are there for a necessary purpose,\" reasoned Mr. Weld. \"Same goes for affirmative action.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For one former Weld campaign worker the speech was the final straw. \"The political culture he vowed to change instead changed him,\" he moans. \"When it comes to Bill Weld, effective term limits probably would have been one term.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What happened? Mr. Weld fancies himself a new strain of politically marketable Republican, his conservatism on taxes and crime made palatable for socially progressive baby boomers by his liberalism on abortion, gay rights, and environmental affairs. For a while, Mr. Weld's approach worked. He won general plaudits for cutting 7,000 state jobs and pushing for privatization of state services and a death penalty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But with re-election safely in hand, the blue-blooded governor has revealed a palpable distaste for the indignities of populism and the impoliteness of the bully pulpit. He counts House Speaker Newt Gingrich as a friend, but has none of Mr. Gingrich's appetite for the grubby work of ideological leadership and party-building.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Weld won his party's nomination in 1990 despite opposition from its right-wing establishment, some of it quite nasty. Consequently, he ignored the party after taking office. Without leadership from atop, the GOP fared poorly in both the 1992 and 1994 legislative elections, dropping enough state Senate seats to lose the ability to sustain any Weld veto. One direct consequence was a successful Democratic override of Mr. Weld's 1993 veto of union-backed legislation bringing his privatization initiatives to a halt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Candidate Weld regaled talk-radio audiences with tough talk on crime and his self-description as \"a filthy supply-sider.\" But Gov. Weld has done little to push supply-side tax cuts. The lone significant trophy, a five-year phase-out of the tax on long-term capital gains, was won not as the result of a public campaign extolling supply-side principles, but as a direct swap for the much-reviled legislators' pay hike. Public outrage over that bit of insider-trading flushed Mr. Weld out for a round of awkward damage-control attempts on the talk shows, where he seemed quite stunned at the near-unanimous disdain of Weldocrats.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In other areas, Mr. Weld's inside game has been even less successful. For instance, his cursory lobbying efforts have not yet led to the passage of a death penalty bill despite 80% support from the public. Republicans, such as the seven GOP representatives who deserted Mr. Weld on the capital punishment vote, feel little pressure from him to maintain party discipline; the Democrats increasingly see no reason to hide their contempt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rather than rub elbows with dreary legislators and demanding constituents, Mr. Weld seems to prefer the counsel of the legal and business cronies he cultivated during his years as a downtown lawyer and U.S. Attorney.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A 1990 campaign vow to remove televisions from state prison cells was quickly discarded under criticism from Democratic law enforcement officials and Mr. Weld's downtown friends. Among a panoply of conservative criminal-justice reforms promised by the candidate, only those with strong support within the Democratic establishment -- such as a long-overdue truth-in-sentencing law -- have materialized.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Weld won't dip into his political capital for a death penalty or serious tort reform, but he will risk Weldocrat goodwill by commuting the life-without-parole sentence of murderer Joseph Yandle, a Vietnam veteran whose supposedly impressive rehabilitation was sympathetically profiled on \"60 Minutes\" and has been a liberal cause celebre. Few Weldocrats need much prodding to recall Mr. Dukakis's furlough of vicious murderer-rapist Willie Horton. The question is: Does Mr. Weld remember?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the Weldocrats find the governor increasingly oblivious to their agenda, liberal elites find him a receptive audience. Mr. Weld claims his lunge to the left on affirmative action was prompted by a visit from Flash Wiley, an African-American businessman and longtime Democratic activist. \"They're old friends,\" said Mr. Weld of Mr. Wiley and his wife. \"When people like them say that when you're a minority contractor, you have to be twice as good, you've got to listen.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And what of the white Weldocrat contractors, shunted by the state's politically correct affirmative-action policies to the back of the line for public contracts? \"I've listened to the claims and assertions for six months about this terrible resentment of white males, and I'm not buying it,\" Mr. Weld told the Boston Globe. \"These are phony assertions. The bottom line is that blacks are twice as unemployed as whites. You have a pretty crushing rationale [for affirmative action] . . . and all the arguments against it you should disregard.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Weldocrats, like their counterparts nationally, are a brittle bunch. As both Bill Clinton and Ross Perot have discovered, their faith in the reformer of the moment is easily shattered. Mislead them on a crucial issue, as George Bush's lips did, and they begin to look elsewhere for hope. Mr. Weld offered the promise that the government would acknowledge their values and address their agony. Instead, his abandonment of them offers a warning to voters elsewhere about the integrity of new-age fusion Republicanism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Keller is a political analyst for WLVI-TV, Channel 56, in Boston.</p>\n"}

Pete Wilson left the governor's office on a high note after morphing into an education reformer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For some time, education has been the winning issue for California politicians. Candidates who ignored it--like Dan Lungren last year--were themselves ignored by voters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But now at least one pollster believes that the issue has peaked and soon will hit the skids as the voters' top concern. \"Health care is charging to the top,\" asserts Steve Kinney of Hermosa Beach, a GOP operative and pollster for 30 years. However, \"infrastructure is the fastest growing issue,\" he adds, and probably will be No. 1 by the 2002 election.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's assuming the economy keeps booming. If not, Kinney foresees voters fretting more about taxes, crime and jobs--as they did earlier in the decade.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kinney's theory about education as a voter motivator is that the politicians--especially Davis--will talk themselves out of a good issue, like animals overgrazing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the Legislature passes the governor's modest reform proposals, the feds kick in more education money and all the pols beat their chests about how they're fixing the schools, voters will believe the problem is being handled, Kinney predicts. Contributing to this complacency will be the voters' memory of having passed a record $9.2-billion school bond issue last November.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Once it's perceived that a problem has been talked about enough and is being solved,\" Kinney says, \"people focus on a new issue.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As evidence, Kinney points to illegal immigration and affirmative action, hot issues that cooled after passage of Propositions 187 and 209. Crime also lost political punch after voters passed the three-strikes initiative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kinney bases his analyses on the voters' intensity of concern. He doesn't just ask people which issues they consider the most important, as pollsters usually do. He asks how important a specific issue is to them \"personally--on a scale of one to 10.\" Then he counts only the \"10s.\" The others can be swayed too easily to another view, he contends.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kinney's polling at the end of 1998 showed education still at No. 1, but health care climbing; 80% called education a \"10,\" compared to 67% for health care. Crime was 35% and taxes 28%.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Education will slip to fourth or fifth by midyear,\" he predicts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Such public passivity is hard to imagine, however, given the latest bad news--screamed in headlines all over the state--that California ranks next to last nationally in fourth-grade reading skills.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Davis' pollster, Paul Maslin, agrees with Kinney about the trend, but not the timing. \"Over a five-year period, he's right,\" Maslin says, \"But I'm not sure he's right over the next two years. I really believe we're a long way from this {education} thing playing out.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Maslin does buy the thesis that health care and infrastructure--highways, potholes, water--will escalate as political issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"As the baby boomers get older, health care will become a lot more personal and worrisome,\" he notes. \"And the state's population is growing again. Well, guess what? We're going to have to figure out a way to build not only more schools, but more water pipes, more roads. . . . Is this state broken or not?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the new governor hasn't been focusing on much except promoting his school bills, mostly at campaign-style road shows.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Davis did announce in his State of the State address that he would create a \"Commission on Building for the 21st Century,\" under Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, to develop an infrastructure master plan. The panel was given a May 1 deadline to report back. But two months later, Davis still has not appointed the commission members.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The two Democratic legislative leaders seem more on the cutting edge of future issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles is sponsoring legislation to expand health care coverage for the working poor. There are 7 million uninsured Californians, he notes, and 40% live in L.A. County. \"Health care should be a right, not a privilege,\" asserts the potential mayoral candidate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco is pushing a $16-billion bond package to modernize the state's transportation system. Besides easing congestion, the liberal lawmaker says his proposal would boost California's economy. \"And if you don't have a growing economy that produces enough revenue to take care of working people and the poor,\" he adds, \"I have real emotional problems.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Davis should get out front and lead on these emerging issues, show he can handle more than one problem at a time.

{"id": "txt/398299761.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Blacks and Whites on Common Ground</h2<p>Twenty-eight years after the Civil Rights Act, racial polarization continues to frustrate consensus on some of the most important issues facing our nation. But recent survey findings may foster mutual understanding by debunking one of the most pernicious myths underlying racial division: that blacks and whites have fundamentally different views and aspirations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This myth has fueled demagogues on both sides of the racial divide, especially in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots. But poll results just released by the left-leaning Joint Center for Political Studies reveal that most blacks aspire like other Americans to safe streets, good schools and home ownership.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of equal import, the survey demonstrates that mainstream black Americans are far more conservative than most of the politicians and organizations that purport to speak for them. This philosophical gulf perhaps was most pronounced near the end of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, when national groups like the NAACP stridently opposed the Supreme Court nominee while blacks in general approved by a three-to-one ratio (along with some local NAACP chapters).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Joint Center study found that more blacks label themselves conservative (33%) than either liberal (28%) or moderate (31%). Young blacks 18 to 34 years old are more conservative, with 38% describing themselves as such.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But conservative blacks have not yet found a hospitable political home. A minuscule 5% of those surveyed are Republicans. The GOP's failure to attract like-minded blacks offers vivid testimony to years of hostility or neglect by Republicans toward matters of concern to black Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Poll findings on specific issues highlight common ground between whites and blacks. Despite opposition by establishment civil rights groups to capital punishment as racially discriminatory, the survey found most blacks favor the death penalty. This finding reflects serious concern about crime. More than half the blacks surveyed live within a few blocks of places they're afraid to walk in at night, and nearly half live in neighborhoods where young men carry guns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Education is the number one election issue for black Americans, the survey found, and 75% support a \"back-to-basics\" direction. In sharp contrast to politicians and establishment civil rights leaders, an amazing 88% support a \"voucher\" system that would allow parents to choose the schools their children attend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like many other Americans, most blacks are skeptical about current welfare policies. Some 57% believe government should not increase aid when single mothers have more children, and 75% think such a policy change would encourage single women to have fewer children. The poll found 91% of blacks support opportunities for low-income people to become homeowners by buying their public housing, a centerpiece of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp's \"empowerment\" agenda.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Joint Center poll echoes an earlier survey by Linda Lichter, which found a gulf over major issues between leaders of black organizations and randomly selected blacks. The survey found 77% of black leaders believed affirmative action should be the most important factor in hiring and education decisions; indeed, National Urban League President John Jacob called this \"the one constant that must be shared by anyone who presumes to hold a leadership position in the black community.\" But the survey found most blacks would flunk this ideological litmus test. Some 77% believe ability rather than race should be the determining factor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Likewise, the Lichter survey found 68% of black leaders favoring forced busing for integration, while 53% of mainstream blacks opposed busing. Two-thirds of black leaders opposed the death penalty for murder, compared with 55% of all blacks who favored it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These findings contain powerful messages for both sides of the policy debate. They explain why liberal groups like the NAACP have lost thousands of members in recent years, particularly among younger blacks. By focusing on social engineering schemes such as racial quotas and set-asides that have little relevance to the real problems facing many blacks, the civil rights leadership elite is growing increasingly out of touch with its constituency.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this regard, the leadership elite's problems are twofold. Racial preferences don't much aid a black underclass beset with ravaging crime, economic stagnation and inadequate schools. Likewise, the growing number of blacks who have joined the economic mainstream may have more in common with other middle class Americans than with those whose agenda remains rooted in the battles of the 1960s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For conservatives, opportunities are apparent. But instead of partisan efforts, they should concentrate on specific issues in which common cause exists with mainstream blacks. Groups such as the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise and the Institute for Justice have built potent coalitions with low-income people on such empowerment issues as school choice, tenant management of public housing, and challenges to regulatory barriers to entry-level entrepreneurial opportunities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If only by default, Bill Clinton likely will win the majority of black votes this November, and he mouthed the rhetoric of empowerment at the Democratic National Convention. But to the extent he caves into special interest groups -- he promised teachers unions he'd oppose school choice that includes private schools -- it could create openings for George Bush.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Bush has fumbled on the race issue, capitulating on a divisive civil rights bill that means little to most blacks while failing to forcefully articulate a positive alternative. Mr. Bush needs to take his case directly to black Americans, presenting a clear agenda to create tangible opportunities for upward mobility.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus far he has not done so. Bush proposals on urban enterprise zones, tenant management, school choice and tax relief are pitched separately and dispassionately, rather than as a comprehensive package the Democrats can't match. The administration some time ago banished the \"E\" word -- empowerment -- from its official lexicon to keep Jack Kemp's star from shining too brightly. So long as it lacks a credible vision and messenger, the GOP richly deserves cynicism from blacks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Regardless of its political or policy implications, the survey's most significant impact is to undermine the stereotype that all blacks think alike -- a stereotype perpetuated by establishment civil rights groups who punish those who dissent from establishment orthodoxy. Federal Appeals Court Judge Leon Higginbotham, for instance, recently scolded Justice Thomas in print for supposedly betraying his race by committing various perceived philosophical heresies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet it was the Thomas nomination itself that disproved this patronizing stereotype once and for all. For Justice Thomas personifies the American Dream of achievement based on merit and hard work. His rise from poverty and segregation marked a vindication of the ideas of equality and opportunity -- ideals to which blacks and whites alike are committed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Martin Luther King Jr. was perhaps the last civil rights leader to understand that. Instead of emphasizing differences among people the way contemporary civil rights leaders often do, he drew constantly upon the principles and aspirations that unite us as Americans, black and white, rich and poor. Indeed, the remaining task of the civil rights struggle is not to redistribute opportunities through a divisive and counterproductive racial spoils system, but to empower those who have been denied opportunities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is on the basis of these traditional American ideas that the problems facing the most disadvantaged members of our society can be surmounted -- and the sometimes seemingly insurmountable chasm between blacks and whites can be bridged.    ---    Mr. Bolick is litigation director at the Institute for Justice in Washington and author of \"Unfinished Business: A Civil Rights Strategy for America's Third Century\" (Pacific Research Institute, 1990).</p>\n"}

One year after California passed a referendum banning the use of race and ethnicity in public college admissions, the number of blacks, Hispanics and American Indians admitted to the University of California's two top campuses has dropped precipitously, leading to concern about the resegregation of higher education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But while the news from California is dismaying, a different, more encouraging story is being written in Texas, a state with political leaders who see diversity as a rich resource that benefits everyone, not only people of color.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last year, a Federal court outlawed consideration of race in higher-education admissions in Texas. At the time, the state had been using high school grades and Scholastic Assessment Test scores along with affirmative action criteria to decide admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the ruling, a panel of professors and community activists joined a group of Hispanic and black lawmakers to persuade the State Legislature to adopt what has come to be called the 10 percent plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This eliminated the use of S.A.T. scores for Texas students in the top 10 percent of their high school class and automatically admitted them to the two most selective public schools, the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A & M University.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At first, some critics objected that S.A.T. scores were indispensable measures of future success. But, as the advisory group of professors and activists pointed out, the best way to predict how a student will do in college is by measuring classroom performance in high school. This was borne out when achievement tests administered to the thousands of minority students admitted through the program showed that only a handful needed remedial education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So far the Texas plan has produced many winners. As of March of this year, 7 percent more black and 21 percent more Mexican-American applicants were eligible for enrollment under this system than under the old affirmative action guidelines. And access to public education has increased for white high school graduates in rural parts of Texas -- students who also tend not to do well on the S.A.T. and so had been refused admission to the most competitive public colleges under the old system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No wonder a number of moderate white legislators joined the coalition in supporting the plan. As State Representative Irma Rangel pointed out, the 10 percent plan treats all groups equally, giving them ''the respect they deserve.'' Similarly, when Gov. George Bush, a Republican, signed the bill, he declared, ''We want all our students in Texas to have a fair shot at achieving their dreams, and this legislation gives them that fair shot.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Texas officials recognize that there is more to be done beyond rethinking college admissions policy. They have also formulated new ideas for improving primary schools. Schools and districts are now required to report test scores, attendance and dropout rates by race, ethnicity and economic standing. Each school is then rated according to the performance of the various ethnic and economic groups. This means more attention is paid to every student, and the entire class benefits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a result, black, Hispanic and economically disadvantaged students are closing the achievement gap. On a national math test given in 1996, Texas fourth graders in various categories -- white, black and poor students -- all ranked first in the country. By contrast, California, where politicians have demonized issues of race, education and immigration, saw its fourth graders, including white students, finish near the bottom, ahead of those in only two other states.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Texas's innovative approaches, and its less polarized environment, are helping to shift an increasingly narrow debate over affirmative action into a wider public discussion on education. This also sends the message that access and diversity are not the enemy of excellence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Drawing (Michael Bartalos)</p>\n"}

Those on the right want to impose state-level bans on teaching critical race theory in public schools. Some also want to remove particular books from libraries and curriculums. On the left, people want to teach about America's history of racism and contemporary systemic racism but from only one perspective, with little if any room for debate. They deny CRT is being taught. I don't believe these are really the only options. Schools can and should teach about race and racism while upholding this nation's liberal values of free inquiry.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I know firsthand that American public schools are suffering from highly ideological instruction. I recently received an email from Maryland's Montgomery County Public Schools, where I have two children enrolled in 11th grade, updating parents on an \"Antiracist Audit\" the school system is undertaking. The report describes a new proposed social-studies curriculum, which \"strengthens students' sense of racial, ethnic, and tribal identities, helps students understand and resist systems of oppression, and empowers students to see themselves as change agents.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don't know if this technically constitutes CRT, and I don't care. What I do know is that this sort of teaching is highly prescriptive. It doesn't sound open in the least to alternative interpretation or debate. It doesn't invite inquiry or encourage critical thinking. It imparts opinion\u2014that the American system currently oppresses specific people in specific ways\u2014as fact. While there is certainly racism in America, how much of it, where it exists and doesn't exist, and what it explains and doesn't explain about the lives of black Americans and other people of color aren't settled questions and should be open to discussion and debate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I wish I could say I was shocked by the audit report's announcement. But the sort of opinion-laden pedagogy it proposed adding to the social-studies curriculum is already a big part of my kids' education. My 16-year-old son has complained bitterly about the discussion of racism at his high school. It's not that he doesn't want to discuss race or racism\u2014he does\u2014but that he doesn't want to be told precisely what to think about every social issue. So saturated has the discussion become about race in school, he told me, that his physics class devoted time to it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His English teacher recently asked him point-blank what he thinks the black American experience is in America today. \"I wanted to say that I think black people are as different from each other as white people are, but I could never say that in class,\" he told me. Instead, he kept silent. Kids are expected to parrot back only one answer: To be black in America is to suffer continuous discrimination and indignation. There is nothing wrong with holding this view, but it clearly isn't shared by everyone in the black community.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In my son's weekly current-events class, which discusses contemporary social issues, something he normally loves to do, every single issue\u2014from sexuality to crime to immigration\u2014is discussed through \"a racial equity lens,\" with no room for alternative interpretations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At least in college he should get some reprieve. He's ruled out going to a small liberal-arts school, so he won't be stuck in a hermetically sealed ideological bubble forever.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My son's experience is far from unique. There is a reason significant numbers of Virginians who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 went on in 2021 to vote in a Republican governor who pledged to push back on CRT instruction. They saw the assignments their children brought home and overheard the Zoom classroom discussions and were rightly horrified.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the new governor, in response to these encroachments on American liberal values, signed an executive order aimed at ending the use of \"divisive concepts\" in Virginia schools. While some of the examples the order uses to define these concepts are truly violative of existing civil-rights law, it is not always so narrowly tailored. It also seeks to stop curriculum or other education-related policy from including the idea that \"members of one race, ethnicity, sex or faith cannot and should not attempt to treat others as individuals without respect to race, sex or faith.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That example is so vaguely worded that it could conceivably be interpreted as a prohibition against teaching various sides of the affirmative-action debate or even about Supreme Court decisions on racial preferences, which would normally be part of a social-studies curriculum. It could certainly make teachers more reluctant to hold discussions on such matters. The executive order's ban is also \"not limited\" to the specific examples it raises and could theoretically deter other important classroom conversations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I want my high-school-age children to learn about the history of this country, including the \"1619\" version. I want them to understand America's legacy of race and racism, chattel slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and red lining. I want them to know that there is still racism in this nation today and about the troubling disparities in various institutions, especially the criminal-justice system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But students like my son should also be exposed to more than one opinion on why there are still racial disparities in America. There's no shortage of rigorous scholarship on the matter. Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson has written several books about the complex role of both systemic and cultural factors in inner-city communities. Columbia linguist John McWhorter, while acknowledging the continuing role of systemic racism, similarly sees other variables at work, including family structure. Brown University economist Glenn Loury has questioned many of the left's pieties on systemic oppression.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Teaching multiple perspectives and the \"1619\" and \"1776\" versions of American history would be the best way to encourage open inquiry. Students could read Ibram X. Kendi's bestseller \"How to Be an Antiracist\" alongside one of the many articles or books by writers like Messrs. Loury, McWhorter and Patterson. Kids would hear theories about \"systems of oppression,\" but they would also hear about the role that class and cultural differences play in disparity. In short, they would receive multiple narratives and explanations about why America is the way it is today and decide for themselves what to think and do about it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I want my kids to get a good education. That means exposing them to ideas that some on the right want banned and other ideas that some on the left actively demonize. That's a true American education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Bernstein is founder of the Jewish Institute for Liberal Values.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Teach '1619' and '1776' U.S. History</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By David Bernstein</p>\n"}

But right now Bradley should not distract attention from Al Gore, whose difficulties multiply. And Bradley's recent foray into the politics of ideas did not make sensible people impatient for his next foray.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gore knows that serving vice presidents who have wanted their parties' nominations have succeeded recently (Nixon in 1960, Humphrey in 1968, Bush in 1988). However, Bush in 1988 was the first incumbent vice president since Van Buren in 1836 to win the presidency. Bush won partly because a contented electorate wanted the closest thing to a third Reagan term. Not many voters next year are going to be thinking, \"Gosh, it would be really neat to prolong the Clinton years!\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Democrats worry about polls that show George W. Bush, about whom voters know little, handily beating Gore in places like Michigan. This in the record 97th month of peacetime economic expansion. And Gore keeps saying strange things. Never mind his I-was-a- hardscrabble-farmer and his I-invented-the-Internet riffs. Consider two recent beauties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pressed by some environmentalists to support aggressive measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars and coal-burning power plants, Gore responded that he's on their side, but challenged them: \"Name a senator who would support me.\" Does it occur to him that there might be something wrong with an agenda opposed by 100 senators?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Recently Gore, speaking of his book \"Earth in the Balance,\" told Time magazine: \"There's not a statement in that book that I don't endorse. Not one. The evidence has firmed up the positions I sketched there.\" Oh? What fresh evidence confirms that ours is a \"dysfunctional civilization\"? Or that automobiles pose \"a mortal threat to the security of every nation that is more deadly than that of any military enemy we are ever again likely to confront\"? Should we then be bombing Detroit instead of Serbia?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The certitude that Gore radiates carries an undercurrent of moral preening -- the suggestion that people who come to different conclusions are morally as well as intellectually flawed. On the evidence of Bradley's recent speech on race, he can match Gore stride for stride in the sanctimony sweepstakes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bradley's speech at Cooper Union in Manhattan was long on earnestness. We all should \"look deeper into the soul of America\" and pursue \"racial healing\" which is thwarted by \"white indifference and black suspicion\" and \"the deadwood of superstition, fear and fantasy.\" Many white Americans \"harbor absurd stereotypes about all people of color.\" We need \"candid talk.\" And so on.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is familiar. On July 10, 1991, in a remarkably unpleasant \"open letter\" to President Bush, Bradley accused Bush of hypocrisy and of \"shamelessly\" engaging in \"race-baiting.\" On July 16, 1991, Bradley implicitly praised himself for \"speaking candidly\" and for the \"moral courage\" to avoid \"easy evasions\" about race by faulting others for not speaking as he does. His \"candid talk\" included falsely accusing Ronald Reagan of saying that \"all female black Americans are welfare queens.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He even left the impression that the surge of murders among young blacks after 1984 was the result of Republican presidents, not crack cocaine. On April 30, 1992, after the Los Angeles riots following the initial acquittal of the police in the Rodney King case, Bradley again described America as \"a society that does not talk honestly about race.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bradley's belief that Americans are not sufficiently and properly preoccupied with race may resonate among Democratic activists. Many of them endorse identity politics, the theory that individuals are decisively shaped and irrevocably defined not by reasoned choices but by accidents of birth and socialization -- by membership in a racial, ethnic or sexual group.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, it is arguable that identity politics, and obsessing about race, is a plague. Bradley wants to \"overcome our divisions\" and \"get to a time when, in Toni Morrison's words, `race exists, but it doesn't matter.' \" But his self-advertised candor does not extend to even considering the possibility that reaching such a time is made more difficult by some things Democrats cherish -- affirmative action, categorical representation (the theory that the interests of a group can only be understood and represented by members of that group) and the rest of the racial spoils system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bradley cannot hope -- who can? -- to beat Gore in the sanctimony sweepstakes. So he should avoid implying that America's failure to measure up to his standard of racial honesty results not from honest differences of opinions among decent people, but from the moral inadequacies of those who do not share his opinions.</p>\n"}

Funded by the Joyce Foundation, Chicago-based Boeing Co. and The Chicago Community Trust, the program, called IMPACT, ended in December after 13 of the city's 25 largest institutions agreed to consider nominees from outside \"the usual suspects\" -- not from their immediate social network, said Peter Kuntz, the executive director of the Arts & Business Council.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Many of the city's civic boards relied on a very small number of minority leaders who were well known by the establishment -- Valerie Jarrett, Desiree Rogers, Tina Tchen,\" said Adele Simmons, the former president of the MacArthur Foundation. \"When they went to Washington (to serve in the Obama administration), they left a lot of vacancies.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kuntz said that these large institutions frequently reported, \"We just don't know how to find these people.\" Searching for \"a whole new group hiding in plain sight,\" Kuntz says, takes time.

But Justice O'Connor may have stopped them in their tracks in under five minutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To say that Justice O'Connor is the most powerful woman in America is a court-watching cliche, and one even she is tired of hearing. When another judge suggested as much at a judicial conference, she said, ''You've been reading too many newspapers.'' But Justice O'Connor has often been the Rehnquist court's swing vote, a solid member of the five-justice conservative majority who nonetheless has broken away at critical moments. Since the court's four liberal members are likely to vote to uphold affirmative action, the white plaintiffs probably need Justice O'Connor to ''get to five,'' as they say on the court. Based on her questions at oral argument -- an imperfect indicator, certainly -- and on her history, it seems she may end up being affirmative action's unlikely savior.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justice O'Connor was raised on an Arizona ranch during the Depression, driving tractors and working with cattle. She graduated third in her class at Stanford Law School, but the only law firm job she could get was as a legal secretary. She later found work as a lawyer, and became active in Republican Party politics, including Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential race. After just two years on the Arizona Court of Appeals, she was plucked from obscurity in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, who had courted women's votes with a promise to name a woman to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the 22 years since, Justice O'Connor has been no one's idea of a liberal. She has written a number of decisions that stand out as not merely conservative, but callous. In 1988, she rejected the claim of a North Dakota child, who lived 16 miles from her school, that she had a right to ride a school bus without paying a fee that her family could not afford. Justice O'Connor has also been largely unsympathetic to African-Americans in discrimination and voting rights cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feminist scholars have long scrutinized her legal thinking, looking for a ''different voice,'' but she has not made it easy. She has sympathized with female plaintiffs, notably a hard-driving woman denied a partnership at Price Waterhouse. But she has turned a deaf ear to others, including a group of blue-collar Ford plant workers challenging a sex-discrimination ruling. For children, she has shown both a soft spot (for student athletes), and a cold heart (for juveniles facing deportation). Some scholars point to cases like these and make the not very flattering argument that Justice O'Connor sympathizes mainly with white, middle-class, up-by-the-bootstraps women -- in other words, people like herself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What has earned Justice O'Connor a reputation as a swing vote is her reluctance to sign on to sweeping pronouncements. She is more inclined than her fellow conservatives to look at the specific facts of a case, worry about a ruling's effect on real people, and pull back before upsetting a major precedent. She disappointed abortion opponents early on when she scaled back abortion rights but refused to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is, of course, no way of being certain how last week's cases will come out. But there is much in Justice O'Connor's two decades on the court to suggest she will, in the end, side with the university. The argument that the Constitution requires absolute colorblindness clearly leaves her cold.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Current university policy relies on Bakke, the landmark 1978 decision allowing race to be considered in admissions. Justice O'Connor may be as unwilling to reverse this well-known case as she was to overturn Roe. The colorblind regime the plaintiffs want would also drive many minorities off elite campuses. Justice O'Connor, who asked at argument what impact California's anti-affirmative action referendum has had on law schools there, is likely to worry about this real-world impact.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then there is Justice O'Connor's inclination to look for herself in the litigants who appear before her. On the surface, Justice O'Connor may seem like the white plaintiffs in these cases. But she owes her place on the court not only to her immense talent and drive, but also to a governmental act -- in her case, by President Reagan -- that can only be called affirmative action. In the end, Justice O'Connor may take a close look at the hard-working, bright University of Michigan applicants who get a few extra points on their applications because they are minorities -- and see herself.</p>\n"}

The publisher called it ''a huge black eye.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How could this happen at the most rigorously edited newspaper in the world? We had plenty of warning: his 50-plus corrections in less than four years as a reporter, his evasion of questions about his whereabouts, complaints from colleagues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Apparently this 27-year-old was given too many second chances by editors eager for this ambitious black journalist to succeed. As he moved to more responsible assignments, some editors failed to pass along assessments of his past shortcomings while others felt the need to protect the confidentiality of his troubles. Result: the con artist gamed a system that celebrates diversity and opportunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Times's executive editor, Howell Raines, is determined to get right with readers by letting the ''terrible mistake'' be examined in excruciating detail. In addition to this opposite of cover-up, he assigned another newsroom group to come up with ways to prevent another failure of communication among our editors, the most expert of communicators.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What's the reaction in Washington, where -- we now know -- the fraudulent reporter came down to stain The Times's coverage of last year's attacks by snipers?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Liberals down here, who only last week had been gleeful at the revelation of conservative Bill Bennett's high-rolling gambling habit, are rendered glum by this embarrassment of the newspaper whose editorial policy they favor. But now my right-wing friends are suddenly up to their hips in their own Schadenfreude. (That's the German word for ''the guilty pleasure one secretly takes in another's suffering.'')</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First comes the culture war. Some of my ideological soulmates say: See? There goes the prestigious New York Times, world paragon of accuracy, newspaper of record, winner of far more Pulitzer prizes than anybody -- suckered for years by one cunning kid. About time those snobby Eastern elitists, twisting the news to fit their prejudices, got their comeuppance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then to the affirmative-action angle: See what happens, they taunt, when you treat a minority employee with kid gloves, promoting him when he deserves to be fired? Oh, we know your editors insist that ''diversity'' had nothing to do with it. But remember what Senator Dale Bumpers said about our impeachment of Clinton: ''When you hear somebody say, 'This is not about sex' -- it's about sex.'' This is about diversity backfiring.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here's my reply to their Kulturkampf: For exactly 30 years, I have been supported handsomely for disagreeing with The Times's editorial page, which is dovish on defense, leftist on economics and (with the exception of civil liberties) resolutely wrongheaded. Never have I been silenced, and conservative thinkers have an ever-fairer shake on the Op-Ed page.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for news coverage being influenced by editorial policy, I evoke the name of my predecessor: that's a Krock. On occasion, a leftist slant on a story slips through the backfield, but with conservatives boring from within and fulminating from without, the news side soon straightens itself out. What is ''fit to print'' is the truth as straight as we can tell it, which is why Times people are so furious at this galling breach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now about the supposed cost of diversity: A newspaper is free to come down on the side of giving black journalists a break if its owners and editors so choose. What's more, this media world would also benefit from more Hispanics and Asians coming up faster.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To the 375 Times reporters who make up the greatest assemblage of talent and enterprise in the field of gathering and writing the news, I submit this hard line:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Self-examination is healthy but self-absorption is not; self-correction is a winner but self-flagellation is a sure loser. Let us slap a metaphoric cold steak over our huge black eye and learn from this dismaying example -- so that other journalists in the nation and around the world can continue to learn from ours.</p>\n"}

There's consensus the U.S. has a long way to go on race.</h2<p>\"He just cut him down and cut him out.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That was the response from South Los Angeles barbershop owner Lawrence Tolliver moments after the NBA commissioner told Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to leave the building, and not just for a day or two, but for life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The commissioner got right to the point, and I am very, very pleased,\" said Tolliver, who hopes Sterling's ban forces him to sell the team to someone who's not an embarrassment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a remarkably blunt televised news conference Tuesday morning, Sterling was repudiated and kicked to the curb for being hateful and stupid enough to have gotten caught establishing himself as a Hall of Fame bigot.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>NBA chief Adam Silver said Sterling admitted that it was his voice on an audiotape scolding a female friend for Instagramming pictures of herself with black folks. He also told her not to bring any of those people to his games.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Meaning NBA games, in which 8 in 10 players are African American.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Daffy? Sick? Tawdry?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Welcome to Donald Sterling's world. It's all the loopier because the female in question is of mixed race and half a century younger than the doddering octogenarian, who is said to have set his friend up with a home near the Beverly Center and luxury cars.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let this be a reminder to one and all: Never get tangled up with anyone 50 years younger because it can only end badly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At Tolliver's clip parlor Monday, the day before Sterling was sentenced to eternal shame, the clientele was having a typically passionate, boisterous conversation on race, as Rosa Parks and Jackie Robinson looked on from their posters on the wall. It's been 67 years since Robinson broke the color line in major league baseball, 59 years since Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus, and just a few days since Sterling turned back the clock.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sterling's remarks, fresh on the heels of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that suggests we're ready to move beyond affirmative action, followed those by Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy on the good old days of cotton picking.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"He said we'd be better off as slaves,\" Tolliver said about Bundy. And then Sterling came along.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tolliver was particularly appalled by the part of the recording in which the man said to be Sterling talked about his players. \"He said, 'I buy their food, I buy their cars, I buy their houses. Like he's a slave owner,\" said Tolliver, who said he believes the players are nothing but tools to boost Sterling's already staggering fortune.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Neither Tolliver nor his customers were shocked by the revelations on the tape. They're well aware that the billionaire property owner once paid millions to settle a housing discrimination case, and he was sued unsuccessfully by onetime Clippers General Manager Elgin Baylor, who said Sterling ran the Clipper operation like it was a plantation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What in the world, Tolliver demanded, had the NAACP been thinking with its plans to honor Sterling after he made a donation to the organization? The group changed its mind when the latest Sterling scandal broke, but Tolliver says Sterling's true colors were already known, and he suspects the owner's charitable donations are investments in image control rather than expressions of true compassion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The barbershop consensus was unanimous on two points:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, that the country has made much progress on race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second, that there's a long way to go, because Sterling is anything but a lone man on a tiny island.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I've been hearing it all my life,\" said Warren Allen, a dentist and Vietnam vet. He said people frequently let loose around him -- with the N-word and more -- because he's light-skinned and they don't know he's African American.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Race-baiting is alive and well, said Bishop Curtis Gadson of Amazing Grace Outreach Ministries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"We have people on television and talk radio scaring the hell out of people,\" Gadson said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The bishop grew up in the South and recalls segregated bathrooms and drinking fountains. He moved to L.A. 50 years ago and knew immediately that it was a better place. But even now, he said, he sees white people eye him suspiciously depending on the time and place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"A whole lot of it has changed, but a whole lot of it went underground, and when Obama became president it all came back out,\" said Ron Simmons, a church elder. \"They couldn't help themselves.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For him, Sterling's remarks deserved full condemnation. He was taken back to 1970, when he was bused from a black high school to an all-white school in Inglewood. The very first day, he recalled, demonstrators greeted their arrival, and one man waved a sign bearing racial epithets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can't have a good barbershop conversation without a dissenting view, and in this case Drew Palmer took the challenge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sterling's purported remarks were deplorable, said Palmer, an engineer and youth mentor. But he says he's more incensed by the casual use of the N-word in street talk and rap lyrics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Why a firestorm over Sterling, he asked, and silence on the objectification of women and glorification of gangs in popular culture? Is it just about capitalism, same as it is for Sterling? And why compassion for millionaire ballplayers who aren't necessarily the best role models, but so little consideration of the working poor who couldn't afford to see a Clipper game even if Sterling allowed them into the building?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Palmer won some points, but no one in the room was about to give Donald Sterling a pass. Simmons, like Tolliver, saw a parallel with the winner of this year's best-picture Oscar.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"It's like '12 Years a Slave,'\" he said. \"Just call it '12 Years a Clipper.'\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>steve.lopez@latimes.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: PHOTO: SOUTH L.A.

Others may see this moment as an isolated event rather than the result of the hard work of Black female candidates, political strategists and voters who have participated in the building of the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Both would be a mistake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Harris is the embodiment of the growing political power of Black women to make demands within the Democratic Party \u2014 and the political sophistication to ensure that those demands are met.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In many recent elections, Black women voters have turned out at higher rates than any other demographic. More than 90 percent of Black women have cast their ballot for the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections. In 2008 and 2012 they had the highest turnout rate among all racial, ethnic and gender groups. No other major demographic is as loyal to either party as Black people. And Black women have become increasingly organized and focused on making that support meaningful for themselves and their community.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That kind of turnout and loyalty doesn\u2019t just happen. Largely without any major investment from the Democratic Party, Black women have worked through grass-roots organizations to register new voters and motivate them to cast ballots. The work of groups like the New Georgia Project to transform the electoral landscape of the South has resulted in hundreds of thousands of new voters. In Alabama, Black women and the Black Voters Matter Fund played pivotal roles in the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017. Across the country, Black congresswomen like Lucy McBath of Georgia, Lauren Underwood of Illinois and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts have run for office and won historic victories.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Black women have also formed organizations to support and encourage more Black women to run for office and maximize their political power. Glynda Carr\u2019s Higher Heights for America, Aimee Allison\u2019s She The People and Leah Daughtry\u2019s Power Rising are examples of organizations that convene discussions with African-American women, empower those who want to run for office and insist that candidates answer questions that are important to Black women. During the Democratic primaries, nearly every candidate showed up to discuss his or her views about race and gender at a forum held by She The People in April. They understood that their road to the White House is paved not just by Black women\u2019s votes but also by their labor as volunteers, community influencers and, increasingly, important donors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, this moment is decades in the making. A century ago this month, women demanded and earned the right to vote through the passage of the 19th Amendment. In that effort, African-American women were often asked to march behind white women and participate in segregated rallies. Most Black women didn\u2019t get access to the ballot until the Voting Rights Act was passed 45 years later. African-American women understood the power of the vote to choose candidates who would enact policies that either helped or hindered their quest for equal rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And despite the intersectional impact of racism and sexism on Black women, they are the nation\u2019s most reliable champions for universal rights for all groups. They are keenly aware that all forms of oppression disproportionately affect Black women; consequently, Black women\u2019s movements have always been inclusive even when that inclusion was not reciprocated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So the selection of Kamala Harris as Joe Biden\u2019s vice-presidential running mate is bigger than an individual choice. It is not just about this one Black woman and her success. The selection is a win for Black women politicians who have higher political ambitions, Black women operatives who want to have more say in how campaigns are run, and Black women voters who want to see themselves among the many candidates the party fields every election.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kamala Harris stands on the shoulders of giants in the Democratic Party who broke down barriers \u2014 the congresswomen Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan and political operatives like Donna Brazile and Minyon Moore. Millions of Black women and their political labor have made this historic day possible. Ms. Harris\u2019s selection represents a major step forward in Black women\u2019s political ascendance and not a single victory.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Melanye Price (@ProfMTP), a professor of political science at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Race Whisperer: Barack Obama and the Political Uses of Race.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

{"id": "txt/398321574.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>On Brown v. Board of Education, Call Him Thurgood Thomas</h2<p>The NAACP board is scheduled to decide today whether to join the interest groups that oppose a black Supreme Court nominee. Benjamin Hooks has said his group would have preferred another Thurgood Marshall. The NAACP should know that when it comes to the Supreme Court's most important civil-rights case, Clarence Thomas is another Thurgood Marshall.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With all the smoke cooked up by Judge Thomas's critics, no one seems to have noticed that he takes precisely the same broad view of the constitutional promise of equality that Mr. Marshall as the lawyer arguing Brown v. Board of Education tried -- unsuccessfully -- to persuade the Supreme Court to adopt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The 1954 case was a great victory for the civil-rights movement and especially for the NAACP where Mr. Marshall worked. The justices finally declared that separate but equal facilities were unconstitutional. A filibuster in the Senate perpetuated Jim Crow segregation, so it was appropriate that the court struck down these racist laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The problem is that Brown is a classic example of a correct result reached by lousy reasoning. The opinion by Chief Justice Earl Warren was based almost entirely on dubious sociological data on how much better black students supposedly learn when they study in the same classrooms as whites. A famous footnote cites behavior studies in publications such as the International Journal of Opinion and Attitude Research. It's now clear that this case was the beginning of an era of judicial activism that substituted shadows, penumbras and judicial social engineering for adherence to constitutional text and original intent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are nearly identical arguments about what the Brown opinion should have said in Mr. Marshall's legal briefs in the case and Judge Thomas's recent speeches and law-review articles. They agreed that the court should have based its decision on legal and constitutional sources, not sociologists. They both referred to the Declaration of Independence's self-evident truth that \"all men are created equal,\" which finally applied to blacks after the Civil War through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Marshall's brief and Judge Thomas's writings both cited Justice Harlan's dissent from the 1896 case that established the doctrine of separate but equal, Plessy v. Ferguson. Justice Harlan would instead have given the Fourteenth Amendment its commonsense reading, which is that it was intended to replace slavery with equality by forbidding the government from treating people differently by race. The amendment promised blacks all the privileges and immunities of citizenship and equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Judge Thomas wrote that if the opinion in Brown had adopted this broader view of the Fourteenth Amendment, separate but equal could have been invalidated without citing \"Kenneth Clark's controversial doll studies, which could just as easily have been used in support of segregation as against it.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The court missed the forest for the trees. \"The Brown focus on environment overlooks the real problem with segregation, its origin in slavery, which was at fundamental odds with the founding principles. Had Brown done so, it would have been forced to talk about slavery, which it never mentions,\" Judge Thomas wrote. He said that a better understanding of the \"first principles of equality and liberty\" would \"lead us above petty squabbling over `quotas,' `affirmative action' and race-conscious remedies of social ills.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once on the Supreme Court, Mr. Marshall supported quotas, but he made some of the same points about a colorblind Constitution in his brief in Brown. \"The roots of our American egalitarian ideal extend deep into the history of the Western world,\" the brief said. \"Philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced an intellectual climate in which the equality of man was a central concept. Their beliefs rested upon the basic proposition that all man are endowed with certain natural rights.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Marshall's reference to natural rights is important because Judge Thomas's critics accuse him of weirdness for using similar terms. For different reasons, it's important reassurance for both liberals and conservatives to understand why Judge Thomas wrote about natural rights. The reason was his search as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for a more enduring guarantee of equality than the fleeting legal standards in Brown.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Liberals should know that Judge Thomas is not on a goose chase for penumbras or emanations from the Constitution into which he can insert his conservative policy preferences-as Justice Marshall too often did to enact his liberal views. Conservatives should know that he invokes natural rights in the service of original-intent jurisprudence. His law review article, \"Toward a `Plain Reading' of the Constitution -- The Declaration of Independence in Constitutional Interpretation,\" stressed that terms must be read according to their original meaning. Individual liberty is constitutionally protected, but group rights are not; discrimination must be punished, but not by mandating quotas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The NAACP's Mr. Hooks recently noted this distinction. Judge Thomas is \"not without some good points,\" he said, adding that \"if a black or a woman has been individually discriminated against or mistreated he'll go to the ends of the earth to correct it.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now it turns out there's not much difference between Justice Marshall and Judge Thomas on the broadest issues of civil rights. It will be fascinating to see if the NAACP has the courage to abandon its usual liberal allies who hope to do to Judge Thomas what they did to Robert Bork.</p>\n"}

{"id": "txt/418520188.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>MAKING JOB TRAINING MORE ACCESSIBLE IS AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</h2<p>Increasingly the accessibility of job training programs for black working women appears to be one way to boost the likelihood of raising their income levels.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A recent study we conducted titled \"Job Training Experiences of Black and Women, 1970-1991\" found that the percentages of black and white women involved in some form of training doubled over the two decades. A greater proportion of white women than black women, however, participated in managerial and professional training.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Throughout most of the 1970s, black women who participated in job training programs tended to be disproportionately represented in clerical and semiskilled programs. They were consequently underrepresented in managerial and professional training programs. Our study results revealed, however, that participation in job training programs among black women eroded throughout the 1980s. As this cohort aged, black women participated less than white women in training programs. Despite this decline, however, we found no differences by type of training among participants in the 1980s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In short, our results pointed to good and bad news regarding women's participation in job training programs throughout a significant portion of their paid working histories. On one hand, job training segregation characteristic of the 1970s evaporated in the 1980s, as black women and white women were equally as likely to participate in clerical and semiskilled programs as they were in managerial and professional programs. On the other hand, equality of access to job training programs between white women and black women characteristic in the 1970s was undermined during the 1980s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, we also found that as these women matured, the intensity of the job training experience resulted in higher wages regardless of the duration of the program and independently of a participant's educational level and work history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We believe that these results can serve to inform the current debate regarding affirmative action. To the extent that job training increases income, thwarted access to such programs along racial lines remains problematic. Many business leaders have implemented affirmative action programs designed to increase diversity and to ensure that historical wrongs are addressed along lines of both race and gender. Our results suggest that human resource personnel still need to find ways to increase the accessibility of job training programs to black working women.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We are not suggesting that access be denied to some at the expense of others. Rather, our view is one of expanding the job training pie, so to speak. That is, to the extent businesses want to attract qualified and diverse personnel, the provision of on-the-job training represents an investment in human capital with tangible rewards to their employees. That such investments also increase the bottom line is not in doubt. Employers can again ensure equal access to job training programs as was the case in the 1970s, and they can do so in light of the more equitable distributive gains between unskilled-semiskilled and managerial-professional training programs made in the 1980s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In regard to individual workers, our results suggest that on-the-job training is a worthwhile pursuit. Increasingly, technology makes today's skills outdated tomorrow. Lifelong learning is an ideal whose time has come. Skill acquisition can no longer be seen as fixed. Instead, individual workers will need to seek out ways to upgrade their skills, thereby demonstrating added value beyond that of accumulated wisdom that often accompanies accumulated experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the future, greater economic rewards are likely to go to those whose competencies change to fit the organizational profile of a valued worker. Women will be very much a part of this workplace. They need to seek both on-the-job and off-the-job training opportunities that are necessary for advancement. Black women in particular must take proactive efforts to ensure access programs commensurate with their individual aspirations and abilities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We also have a responsibility to serve as role models and coaches to the next generation of women preparing to enter the workforce. Women also must share their experiences with younger women through mentoring programs. Advocating that high school girls take extra mathematical, computer science and science courses will help to prepare them for the workplace of tomorrow. Encouraging young women to pursue college degrees and to take seriously the commitment to continuing education may help to diminish the job segregation that is still too commonplace.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Businesses should see on-the-job training as investments in human capital that are mutually advantageous for themselves and their workers. Of particular importance is continuous learning for mid-career employees, who may be far removed from academic life per se. Rather than creating an environment that disposes of dependable, competent workers whose specific skills may be needed less as time goes on, employers can capitalize on known quantities by providing access to job training designed to meet the changing requirements of the job. In so doing, employers should judge performance in terms of competencies and avoid channeling women into stereotypic roles or roles narrowly associated with past work histories.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lower access to training and over representation in clerical programs for black women may have channeled them into jobs not commensurate with their abilities. Black women remain the most underrepresented in managerial positions.

{"id": "txt/408354994.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The University of Michigan Case</h2<p>JENNIFER GRATZ'S lawsuit challenging the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy is a win-win proposition for opponents of affirmative-action programs and a significant headache for their defenders. If Ms. Gratz prevails in the lower courts, the university could be forced to dismantle its program, joining public universities in California and Texas that have adopted race-blind admissions policies and then seen minority enrollments plummet. On the other hand, if Ms. Gratz loses, foes of affirmative action will have the opportunity to challenge the race-conscious admissions processes before the Supreme Court at a time when the high court is notably unfriendly to affirmative action generally.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Gratz, who is represented pro bono by the conservative Center for Individual Rights, claims she was discriminated against when she was wait-listed and later turned down by Michigan two years ago because she is white. On its face, she appears to have a strong case. University admissions guidelines seem to instruct admissions officers to handle minority applications differently from those of white applicants, laying out a dual set of standards that could raise a constitutional problem under the Supreme Court's 1978 case University of California Regents v. Bakke. In Bakke, the court allowed race to be a factor in admissions but said it could not preclude any candidate from receiving full consideration. That is precisely what Ms. Gratz alleges happened to her, because the guidelines suggest that comparably qualified minority candidates generally should be admitted. These are disturbing guidelines, and it is significant that the university has since changed its admissions system to one that would be easier to defend under Bakke.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the same time, it would be premature to pass judgment on a complex admissions system before all the evidence is in. It is difficult to demonstrate that any one student was rejected because of race as opposed to the myriad other factors that influence admissions at a large university, and the University of Michigan gives preferential treatment to students on bases other than race. Students from certain counties in Michigan get preferential treatment, for example, as do students whose parents are Michigan alumni. It is not logical to suggest that race can be a factor in admissions but can never play a decisive role in an individual admissions decision. Even a program that meets the Bakke test, in other words, is going to produce certain white victims -- like, perhaps, Ms. Gratz -- so the mere fact that such victims exist cannot necessarily mean that the program is constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The larger question, of course, is whether Bakke even remains the law of the land. Normally, the courts wait for the Supreme Court to renounce one of its own rulings before declaring the ruling dead. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit paid the high court no such deference when it ruled last year that the University of Texas could not use race as a factor in law school admissions. This was, in our judgment, a bad decision that jumped the gun on an important constitutional question. But it is also possible that the decision in Hopwood v. Texas correctly anticipated the direction that the Supreme Court, which declined to review the case, eventually will go on affirmative action in education. It is not obvious that this will be the case, however. While the court has narrowed the acceptable uses of affirmative action in recent years, the public university is a unique environment -- constitutionally as well as culturally. Allowing a university to foster diversity by factoring race into admissions decisions under certain narrow circumstances still seems to be a constitutional approach.</p>\n"}

''What's important here is the end, diversity. Affirmative action is just one means to that end.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Carnesale is the new Chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles, a great public university in a diverse city. He moved here in July from Harvard, where he was dean of the Kennedy School and then provost. He arrived at a turning point for affirmative action in California.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A new policy of the Regents of the University of California, effective this year at the graduate school level, forbids giving preference in admissions on the basis of race or ethnicity. Proposition 209, which has just gone into effect, makes that a rule for all state institutions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a result of the Regents' policy, the number of Hispanic and black students at the U.C.L.A. Law School has dropped sharply. Last year 104 blacks were admitted, this year 21. Of the 21, only 8 enrolled. (At Boalt Hall, the University of California Law School at Berkeley, none of the black students admitted this year actually came.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To Al Carnesale, figures like those -- and what they indicate may happen in undergraduate admissions -- represent a profound challenge. He outlined three reasons he believes diversity is essential to U.C.L.A. fulfilling its responsibilities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''First,'' he said, ''we have to provide the best possible education for our students. And I have no doubt that education is markedly advanced by diversity -- because students learn from each other. Teaching foreign policy at Harvard, I saw it at work. The differences in perspectives were so informative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''Second, it is our responsibility to prepare leaders for all segments of our society. We are a public university. And the way to do that is to provide high-quality education for potential leaders in all groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''Third, one of the things that sets the United States apart is access to social and economic mobility. And the key to that is education. Go around the table at a meeting of business leaders, and half the stories you hear will have violins playing in the background.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If Mr. Carnesale feels strongly about that, it is because his own story has plenty of violins in the background. He was brought up in a Bronx tenement near Yankee Stadium, the son of a taxi driver, and then lived the American dream: Bronx High School of Science, nuclear engineer, adviser to Presidents on arms control.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''What can we do to maintain diversity now?'' he asked. ''We can encourage minority students whose records make them eligible to apply, and then encourage those admitted to enroll. We have to make sure people know they're welcome. In fact, the message is that they're wanted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''In the medium term, we have to get more minorities eligible. It means we have to be much more engaged in the high schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''In the long run, there has to be something like equal opportunity for all kids to get a good education in this country. Better-off people will always have an advantage, but equal opportunity should be a goal, an aspiration.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The passage of Proposition 209 may make people think that California now requires the university to admit students solely on the basis of academic scores. That is not so. In fact, the rules require that at least 25 percent of each class admitted reflect qualities apart from school records and test results.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''We use affirmative action all the time,'' Mr. Carnesale said. ''It is not by looking at academic merits alone that we have a football team with a 9-2 record, going to a bowl.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''In going over applications for admission you notice that applicants come from different countries, or this one plays the cello, or that one is a published poet or has overcome great personal obstacles in her life. We may notice all those things -- but not race or ethnicity or gender.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The fact is that, in California and everywhere, values apart from test scores do figure in university admissions policies -- and should. A society that has prospered in diversity cannot want monochrome higher education.</p>\n"}

Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In their new book, \"America in Black and White,\" Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>\n"}

Northern Virginia today offers a snapshot of how affirmative action, intended as a benevolent effort to prevent discrimination, has hardened into an ugly war on achievement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The latest fuss was kicked off before Christmas when Asra Nomani, an India-born mom and reporter, wrote a piece for the Manhattan Institute's City Journal detailing how her son's Virginia high school never informed him he'd been recognized by the National Merit Scholarship Program.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Other students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology -- known as \"TJ\" and regularly ranked America's No. 1 high school -- said they had the same experience. So Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares launched a civil-rights investigation on Jan. 4. Days later, principals at two more Fairfax County high schools, Westfield and Langley, admitted they too had failed to inform student award winners.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Miyares then expanded his investigation to all Fairfax County. No sooner had he done so than neighboring Loudoun County reported that three of its high schools had delayed notifying its students -- though officials insisted it wasn't intentional. On Friday, four more Fairfax high schools fessed up, followed by another on Monday.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The National Merit Scholarship Program is a competition of 1.5 million students, based on their scores on the Preliminary Standard Achievement Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test. \"Commended Students\" rank in the top 3%, while \"Semifinalists\" test in the top 1%.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's an achievement that can make a difference on a college or scholarship application. But the kids who weren't told they were National Merit winners, or were told too late, couldn't include it on their applications.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given that the program leaves notifications up to the individual schools, it's possible that all these failures were bureaucratic snafus. But the context offers a less generous reading. Public education in Fairfax County has become the front line for an equity agenda that has hardened into a war on achievers, who are disproportionately Asian-American.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a federal judge pointed out in 2022 in a case contesting TJ's new admissions policy, the Fairfax County School Board eliminated the merit-based entrance exam to make room for African-American and Hispanic students by reducing the number of Asian-Americans. In that sense it \"worked.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The class admitted before the change was 73.05% Asian-American, 3.29% Hispanic and 1.23% African-American. After the change, these figures went to 54.36%, 11.27% and 7.09%, respectively. The share of white students grew from 17.70% to 22.36%.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Meantime, in October district officials signed a $455,000 contract for strategic planning with consultant Mutiu Fagbayi of Performance Fact Inc. A PowerPoint presentation he'd already delivered at a September 2022 Fairfax County School Board retreat defines equity as \"equal outcomesfor every student,without exception.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Or consider Shawnna Yashar, another TJ mom, whose son wasn't told he was a commended student until after the deadline for his early admissions application. Ms. Yashar says that when she complained to TJ's director of student services, Brandon Kosatka, he told her that the school wants \"to recognize students for who they are as individuals, not focus on their achievements,\" and that it delayed informing winners to spare the feelings of those who didn't qualify.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's hard not to notice that those who paid the price for this approach were overwhelmingly Asian-American, judging by the names on the National Merit Semifinalists' list published by Fairfax County. Asian-Americans at TJ accounted for 101 of the 132 winners, or 77%. At Langley it was 10 of 15 (66%), and for Westfield it was four of five (80%).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Asian-Americans make up only 18.97% of the student population of the Fairfax County public schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What makes Asian-American achievement so resented by our equity warriors is that it exposes as false the narrative about an irredeemably racist America where minorities can't succeed. This progressive disdain for Asian-Americans is amplified by a resentment of moms and dads who believe they should have a say in their kids' educations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In Virginia, parents watched teachers unions agitate to keep classrooms closed during Covid. They learned the National School Boards Association asked the Biden administration to regard angry parents who showed up to public meetings demanding accountability as domestic terrorists. And they heard a schools superintendent in Loudoun County lying to them about a brutal sexual assault of a 15-year-girl in a school bathroom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now these same officials want parents, especially Asian-American parents, to believe that not informing their children that they won a prestigious academic competition was an innocent oversight. We'll see what the attorney general finds. But nothing these school officials have done has earned them a presumption of trust.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Write to mcgurn@wsj.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By William McGurn</p>\n"}

These policies will downgrade academic qualifications (grades and test scores) and will include factors such as the students' athletic or artistic ability or struggle against poverty. The supporters of these changes say they will not use the new rules to promote raced-based admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The real goal of the new guidelines is the elimination of the concepts of fairness and objectivity from the admissions process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is no accident that most colleges use the SAT and high school grades as the main criteria for admissions. These have been shown for decades to be the best predictors of scholastic performance. The SAT has the added advantage over grades in that everyone takes the same test and the test is scored the same way for everyone. The SAT is objective. It is blind to race, gender, age, politics, religion, national origin and sexual orientation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is precisely why the regents oppose it. They want the admissions process to be subjective. This means that hidden agendas can be brought into the admissions process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Does anyone believe that the new guidelines will not be politicized? UC Berkeley is one of the most left-wing schools in the country. Ability aside, who is more likely to get admitted there under the new \"flexible\" guidelines--the high school radical who claims that the attack on the World Trade Center was our fault or the conservative student who supports our right to self-defense?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Does anyone believe, despite explicit disclaimers to the contrary, that race will not be brought back as a factor in admissions?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In May the regents voted to drop a 6-year-old ban on affirmative action. Because state law prohibits affirmative action in public hiring and admissions, the regents clearly were sending a message by their vote.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The new criteria will serve to protect the university system against discrimination charges by academically qualified students of the wrong race. Previously, students who were discriminated against because of race could show that they should have been admitted because their test scores and grades were better than those who were admitted. If they took the case to court, they usually won. Now the university can say, \"We used a holistic procedure based on numerous factors that vary from student to student, and we decided that student X had a special combination of qualities that we wanted and student Y did not.\" Such subjective guidelines offer a rejected student no chance of winning in a court of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The regents claim that the new guidelines will allow the admission of people with athletic ability. Whom are they trying to fool? For better or for worse, good athletes have been given preference in admissions to colleges and universities for decades.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And how does a struggle against poverty, as admirable as that is, qualify one for college admission?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>UC President Richard C. Atkinson says that high school students can gain admittance if they work hard and take tough courses. But how can he promise such a thing if the new guidelines specifically de-emphasize academics? Under the new procedures, it is impossible for a student to know what to do to prepare for college. The new \"flexible\" criteria can be anything the admissions office wants. The ones to suffer the most will be precisely the intelligent, hard- working, high-achieving students who most deserve admission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The real motive for the new admissions criteria is egalitarianism. The regents cannot accept the fact that some people are more academically qualified than others so their solution is to undermine the concept of academic competence. If they succeed, both students and universities will be the worse for it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Edwin A.

{"id": "txt/398530550.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Quota person</h2<p>The more we look at President Clinton's nomination of Alexis Herman to be Labor Secretary the more we wonder what the White House could have been thinking. Amid a campaign-contributions maelstrom, they name a person -- the director of the White House Office of Public Liaison -- who is almost certainly at or near the eye of the storm (yes, we know, she was oblivious to it all, never came in contact, etc.). Now comes evidence of the rankest sort of quota-mongering by the person nominated to head one of the nation's most work-force-sensitive offices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The White House tells us that the chart below was part of a larger memo created for and \"in consultation with\" a working group headed by Ms. Herman during her White House tenure. The memo is titled \"Proposal to Enhance Administration Outreach to the African-American Community in 1996.\" Its existence was first reported by two weeklies, the Forward and Human Events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, it is obviously appropriate for the White House to reach out to the African-American community, and aggressively, in a Presidential campaign. What is striking about this chart is the programmatic mind-set it displays. Indeed, the chart is of a piece with the very same sort of document that in August laid out specific quota assignments for delegates to the Democratic convention -- \"adopt and implement affirmative action programs with specific goals and timetables for African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Americans and women\" (Review & Outlook, \"The Quota Convention,\" 8/26/96).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One exculpatory response to all this might be that the Democrats' internal political arrangements are their own business. We agree. The more compelling image to emerge from these practices, however, is that of a party in thrall to its constituent factions' demands, no matter what moderate rhetoric is put out for broader public consumption. Indeed, it was widely reported that Mr. Clinton was under enormous post-election pressure in naming his Cabinet from \"women\" and \"labor\" and \"minorities.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And yet once Ms. Herman is Secretary Herman we're supposed to believe that all this Democratic reality goes away, that the operative theory is \"mend it, don't end it,\" and that in its formal submissions to the Labor Department Texaco won't have to produce a chart just like the one Alexis Herman generated for the Clinton-Gore campaign.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As cases like Texaco's show, the 1990s are turning out to be the decade in which our national controversy over race moves beyond the academy to reside in the corporation. Along with the EEOC, the Labor Department is at center stage. Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regularly polices most Fortune 500 companies on their affirmative action practices; through the federal contract connection, Labor has the power to regulate more than half of the economy. Precisely for these reasons, the Labor Secretary's job should go to someone with great judgment and sensitivity, two traits not obviously in evidence in this nominee.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n"}

We all know that, despite too many setbacks, black Americans are plowing ahead. But, to some degree for reasons that may be part psychological and part tactical, blacks have hesitated to point it out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Michael T. Nettles points it out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, says the University of Michigan professor of education, an estimated 89,000 African Americans will be getting baccalaureate degrees this year, continuing a trend that saw an increase of more than 50 percent in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. \"Since 1985, when we were just 8.8 percent of all undergraduates, we've been increasing our presence to the point where we are now over 11 percent,\" he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moreover, he noted, the increases have come in virtually every higher-education sector: in the most highly selective private institutions (up by 57 percent in the 20-year period), in predominately white public universities (up 48 percent), in historically black schools (up 14 percent) and in every region of the country -- with the South leading the pack.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nettles, who is executive director of the Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute, which prepared the report for the United Negro College Fund, said he's not trying to be unduly rosy-eyed -- merely realistic about the trends his research disclosed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The report just puts a much-needed positive light on what African Americans have accomplished,\" he said in a telephone interview from Ann Arbor. \"We've still got work to do, no question about it. We're not where we should be in enrollment (blacks are just over 11 percent of the nation's college enrollees but about 14.5 percent of the college-age cohort), in graduation rates (45 percent after five years vs. 57 percent for whites) or in faculty (less than 5 percent of the nation's faculty). In addition, while we're graduating 89,000 baccalaureates, we have only about 1,600 PhDs -- out of 44,000 in the country -- and that's where you get faculty.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nettles is concerned, too, that black freshmen lag their white counterparts by nearly a full letter grade in grade-point average. \"That needs to be improved,\" he says.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And so does the status of young black males.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to Nettles, 63 percent of all African American undergraduates are women, while the rates for other groups are much nearer equal: about 53 percent women for whites, slightly more than 50 percent male for Asian Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The story for African American men who make it to college is not a negative story,\" Nettles insists. \"About 37 percent of the entering African American freshmen are males -- and about 37 percent of those earning baccalaureates are male.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The male-female disparity in college-going rates, though, continues a long-term trend that Nettles can't quite explain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For instance, last year's United Negro College Fund report disclosed that the number of black women earning bachelor's degrees had increased by some 55 percent since the mid-1970s, but by only 20 percent for black men.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"We think a part of the explanation may have to do with greater other-than-college opportunities for black men,\" he said. \"The jobs available for boys after high school look better than the jobs available to girls.\" He mentioned military service (black men are 19 percent of new enlistees) and construction work.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I suspect something else is going on. I look at public high schools -- particularly in the urban centers -- and see an already noticeable male-female gap. Indeed, you can see the beginnings of the trend in junior high classrooms. I think we're losing the boys long before it comes time for college applications.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still I have to agree with Nettles's positive spin -- and for two reasons. The first is that the enrollment and graduation trends furnish a solid base on which to build future progress. The second, which applies not just to college but to every aspect in black life, is that if you don't know where your successes are, you don't know where to make the next push.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1014285656.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>A Little Bit Indian</h2<p>\"I still have a picture on my mantel and it is a picture my mother had before that -- a picture of my grandfather. And my Aunt Bea has walked by that picture at least a thousand times [and] remarked that he -- her father, my papaw -- had high cheekbones like all of the Indians do. ... Being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- Elizabeth Warren, Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts, trying to explain why she identified herself as a \"minority\" law professor in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>IT happens in a lot of American families. My maternal great-grandfather was born on a Maine island in the 1880s, in the days when Penobscot Indians still rode birch-bark canoes from their inland reservation to the coast for their annual clambake. I always had the definite idea that he had Indian blood himself -- maybe Penobscot, maybe Abenaki, maybe another New England tribe. In the photographs I have of him, he certainly looks the part, with a profile suited for an Indian Head penny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My great-grandfather left an autobiography behind, though (that's how I know about the canoes and the clambake), and I went back to it recently and couldn't find even a hint of an Indian connection: just a typical old New England genealogy, mostly English families with some Irish woven in. This would have been immensely disappointing to my 10-year-old self, since I can remember telling friends in American history class, with an air of authority, that I was almost certainly one sixteenth Native American, or at the very least one thirty-second.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It seems that Elizabeth Warren may turn out to be similarly disappointed, after the New England Genealogical Society acknowledged last week that there's no firm evidence of her great-great-grandmother being Cherokee.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That supposed ancestral tie was what inspired the professor-turned-Senate candidate to identify as an ethnic minority in law school directories early in her career. More important, it was what inspired The Harvard Crimson to refer to Warren as Harvard Law School's \"one tenured minority woman\" and The Fordham Law Review to cite her as Harvard Law's \"first woman of color\" during the mid-1990s debates over faculty diversity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now that same claim -- and her clumsy, \"my grandfather had high cheekbones\" attempts to defend it -- has become perhaps the biggest obstacle in her quest to reclaim Ted Kennedy's Senate seat for liberalism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The whole story has a tragicomic, Nathaniel Hawthorne meets \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" feel. It's easy to imagine Warren originally checking a box more on a whim than out of any deep determination to self-identify as Cherokee. (She didn't use the minority-applicant program when applying to Rutgers, where she attended law school, and she identified as \"white\" during an early teaching job at the University of Texas.) Then it's easy to imagine her embarrassment when the diversity wars of the 1990s made that whimsical choice something from which she couldn't dissociate herself without intense public awkwardness. Those wars faded, she no longer listed herself as a Native American, she thought the whole thing was behind her ... until she went into politics, where no secret stays buried.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The appropriate response to such a tale is probably sympathy rather than scorn. What does deserve scorn, though, is the academic culture in which an extremely distant connection to a Cherokee ancestor ends up being touted by a law school as proof of its commitment to diversity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A diverse faculty and campus can be a laudable goal. But the point is to build academic communities that actually contain a wide variety of experiences and perspectives, not to wax self-congratulatory because you've met a set of ethnic quotas. The story of Elizabeth Warren, \"woman of color,\" represents a reductio ad absurdum of the latter tendency, which has been all too prevalent in elite universities -- giving us affirmative-action programs that benefit West Indian immigrants more than the descendants of slaves, and faculties that include a wider range of skin tones than of political and religious views.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The irony is that Warren herself probably did make Harvard more diverse, since she grew up the daughter of a janitor in Oklahoma -- not a typical background, to put it mildly, for Ivy League students and faculty today. But under the academy's cramped definitions, it was her grandfather's Cherokee cheekbones, not her blue-collar roots, that led to her citation as a supposed trailblazer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That isn't a serious approach to academic diversity, and in an emerging majority-minority America (already visible in the latest Census birth statistics) where almost everyone will be 1/8 something-or-other, it will be an increasingly untenable one as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For many colleges and universities, then, this contretemps represents a timely gift: a chance to think anew about these issues, before the pursuit of a cosmetic diversity leaves them looking as ridiculous as poor Elizabeth Warren does today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398602003.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Politics &amp; People: The Race Initiative: Tough but Worth the Effort</h2<p>President Clinton's initiative on race is off to a rocky start.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>John Hope Franklin, who heads the National Advisory Committee on Race, is an eminent historian but a poor politician in a post that requires political skills. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater's political skills abandoned him recently when he participated in a racial dialogue that pointedly excluded whites.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The president's town meeting in Akron last week was fumbling and lacking focus. Mr. Clinton was snappish with one of the few prominent dissident voices and overstated the case when he declared that Colin Powell got to his exalted rank in the Army because of affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But this still is a very worthwhile effort. America has fumbled, and worse, on race for 250 years. Thus it's hardly surprising that a reasonably ambitious effort for addressing this festering American malady would encounter early trouble.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moreover, this is a departure for President Clinton, who too often has focused on the small-bore, politically easy agenda items that his former political strategist, the infamous Dick Morris, so cheaply champions. But race is not small bore or easy. There's not only a risk that this won't succeed, but given the history, the odds are that it won't.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sometimes it's easy to forget that a little over 30 years ago, there were precious few blacks in the executive suites, newsrooms or political corridors; it was commonplace for African-Americans to be excluded from public accommodations and even the vote, and that throughout much of the South, drinking fountains were marked \"colored\" or \"white.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet for all the extraordinary progress over these past three decades, race remains an excruciating American dilemma. That's why the multifaceted Clinton initiative is as commendable as it is complex.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Michael K. Frisby reported in this newspaper last week that the White House is bringing the advisory committee on race back firmly under its control. New proposals, with a focus on youth, are being hatched in time for the January State of the Union address.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And there is far more sensitivity to the rap that this has been a one-sided dialogue excluding many conservatives or critics of controversial ideas like affirmative action. Next Wednesday, the advisory committee will meet with prominent conservative Bill Bennett. Two days later, President Clinton will meet with Jack Kemp and, probably, Ward Connerly, who led California's successful antiaffirmative action ballot initiative last year.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like it or not, the specter of affirmative action hangs over this discussion. Americans are sharply divided over granting selective preferences to minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If affirmative action is seen as quotas or rigid preferences, particularly in school admissions or hiring and promotion, Americans are overwhelmingly opposed. If it is seen as opening up, assuring and even fostering equal opportunities, the public is solidly for it. The problem is that affirmative action has been all of the above.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In two of the most publicized votes, Californians by 54% to 46% voted down affirmative action on the state level a year ago. By the same margin, voters in Houston last month voted to continue that city's affirmative action program. In both cases, the opposing side argued the decision was stacked or the wording of the referendum was flawed; in fact, both votes are very indicative of where America is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This was evident in the highly publicized incident at the president's town meeting in Akron, Ohio, last week. He asked author and affirmative action critic Abigail Thernstrom if she wanted to end the type of affirmative action programs that promoted Colin Powell in the Army. This issue and exchange has been seized upon by both sides with considerably more heat than light.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In fact, according to Clifford Alexander, who was Secretary of the Army when Gen. Powell became a general, the promotion board came back with a paucity of minority candidates. He simply sent them back to see if other candidates could be found; Colin Powell was in the next group. \"This was not an affirmative action program,\" Mr. Alexander says.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But it's absurd to suggest that the army -- or almost any other institution that has successfully integrated in recent years -- has followed the laissez-faire approach that abandons all remnants of affirmative action, which is now espoused by many conservatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One good example is the U.S. Military Academy. West Point now sets a \"class composition goal\" of 7% to 9% African-American cadets every year. The last two incoming classes have been about 7.5% black. These goals are achieved by sending promising young African-Americans to the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School for a year to get them up to West Point standards. Overall, 14% of West Point's cadets attended this military prep school, but 37% of its African-Americans did. That is affirmative action, recognizing that there isn't a level playing field.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The bill Republicans are pushing in Congress would outlaw nonbinding affirmative action goals, which would do away with much of what the Army and West Point are now achieving. That's why even some conservative African-Americans, like Rep. J.C. Watts (R., Okla.), urge caution before dismantling existing programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No one has navigated this tightrope better than Gen. Powell. In his autobiography, he wrote that \"preferential\" treatment \"demeans\" achievement, but where discrimination has existed \"it is only fair to provide temporary means\" to catch up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This week in an interview, Mr. Powell says the issue has nothing do with him but rather with where we are as a society and what works. \"Some of my friends take only the first part of what I wrote and conclude, `see, he's against preferences.' But that was very difficult to write and I nuanced it very carefully. We had a preference system for over 200 years that did not include black people.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What is essential now, he says, \"is to get away from the inflammatory stuff that shuts down dialogue. Let's stop saying that everyone on one side is a racist. Let's stop saying that all preferences are bad when we live in a system of preferences. We go to court over preferences if someone is black but not if they get a preference because their parents went to that school.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If President Clinton's initiative can help tame such inflammatory rhetoric, that alone will be a useful exercise.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/408345293.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Affirmative Action: We Know Better</h2<p>I hear the arguments over affirmative action -- highlighted this week by the Supreme Court's refusal to review California's Proposition 209 and by the Senate Judiciary Committee's dogfight over Bill Lann Lee's nomination for the top civil rights job in the Justice Department -- and I think: They know better.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No. We know better. But listen to us. One side pretends to believe that racial discrimination, no matter how rampant and flagrant it used to be, is now ended. Oh, maybe there's a bigot or two in the woodpile, but discrimination as a matter for governmental concern is a thing of the past.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other side pretends to believe that only racists who oppose minority progress could be against affirmative action. Discrimination a thing of the past indeed! A black man in America still hasn't got a chance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Each side knows (but feels no urge to acknowledge) that there is at least some justice to the other's position. The blatant segregation and discrimination are largely over. Law now forbids such racism, and -- I really do believe -- public opinion won't countenance it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But racial fairness (in some instances, in some arenas) still eludes us. Corporate management and directorships, legal and accountancy partnerships, and even concern for the plight of our children clearly are not distributed on the sole basis of deservedness. Race matters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The truth is complicated and inconsistent and hard to figure out. Instead of undertaking the effort to figure it out, we draw the lines as starkly as we can and force the public to choose one incomplete reality (ours, we hope) and reject the other side's partial truth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It happens not just in our race relations but throughout our politics. It even happens in our courts, as when the clever Barry Scheck deliberately cut out any middle-gray consideration in the trial of Louise Woodward, the British au pair. Force the jury to choose between the cold-blooded murder of an innocent child and innocence (or at least reasonable doubt), he thought, and surely there won't be a conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His now-famous miscalculation (he was in court this week trying to reinstate the grays) might serve as a lesson to us all.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And it might show us the wisdom of changing the terms of the debate. Much of what I'm saying, I admit, is based on my belief that most Americans want to be fair and want our important institutions to reflect that fairness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don't believe there are significant, politically influential segments of the society that are happy over the fact that African American admissions at Boalt Hall, the University of California-Berkeley's law school, are down 80 percent as a direct result of Proposition 209's ban on racial preference, or that the first-year class has but a single black member. I don't believe there are large pockets of secret jubilation that a similar trend is in evidence at the University of Texas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the other hand, though, I doubt that many affirmative action supporters -- including the beleaguered Bill Lee -- want to parcel out society's goodies on the basis of racial entitlement. Many of us may defend, but few of us are thrilled by, voting districts drawn purely on the basis of race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We want (is this hopelessly naive?) the same thing: a society in which gifts and grit and character matter more than pigmentation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So what are we fighting about? Mainly, I think, about how to produce such a society. Some of us believe that the best way to achieve a colorblind future is to practice colorblindness now. And some of us believe that colorblindness after centuries of racism will merely lock in white advantage -- that we need to level the playing field before insisting on a single set of rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I remember when black quarterbacks were a rarity in the National Football League -- when the most talented collegiate passers were, if they were black, switched to defensive back or running back or some such. Then a couple of coaches broke the mold -- affirmative action? -- and then a couple more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Do the six starting quarterbacks (out of 30 NFL teams) constitute parity? Wrong question. What is true is that there is, at last, reason for young black athletes to believe they can go as far, at any position, as their talent takes them. As Gene Washington, a black front office executive with the league, told a reporter:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"What's most interesting to me is that I don't notice it. That's a good sign.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's a very good sign.</p>\n"}

Maybe that's why, in this race of all-but-certain presidential nominees, I find myself distracted by Alan Keyes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Or rather by the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes. I'm not suggesting that Keyes is likely to repeat in New Hampshire his startling showing in the Iowa caucuses--a third-place finish with 14 percent of the vote--much less that he'll still be battling George W. Bush for the Republican nomination as the party convention draws nearer. The subplot I've been following treats a much simpler question: Are white voters truly capable of looking beyond a black candidate's race?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Black Americans seem certain that the answer is \"no,\" while white voters--on much the same evidence--believe it has long since been answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Didn't we help elect David Dinkins mayor of New York City and Doug Wilder governor of Virginia? whites will say. And blacks will reply: Yes, but in substantial measure out of racial guilt--which means that it was, at bottom, a race-tinged vote. Similarly with elected officials from Massachusetts's Ed Brooke to Oklahoma's J. C. Watts, and with that most-popular of noncandidates, Colin Powell. I remember remarking, with utter seriousness, that the white-led bandwagon for Powell was a way for white people to prove to themselves they had gotten over their fixation on race. Now Alan Keyes has me wondering if I've gotten over mine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A televised interview with a handful of Iowans after the Keyes surprise makes my point. The reporter was talking to these white conservatives--members of what we call the \"religious right\"--and a couple of them were explaining how they compared Keyes and Gary Bauer and found Keyes's views more to their liking. One of the respondents mentioned that she'd like to see Keyes on the ticket of the eventual nominee.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What struck me about that brief exchange was that it seemed genuinely to have nothing to do with race, only issues. And I was reminded by something in my long-repressed memory:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Strom Thurmond, as Old South and conservative as they come, standing up at those 1991 Judiciary Committee hearings for Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. I don't imagine Thurmond was motivated by racial angst. Indeed, the Senate's 1,000-year-old man seemed indifferent to the fact that Thomas's white wife, Virginia, was a daily fixture at those hearings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He may have supported Thomas for reasons I would reject, but on this issue, at least, Strom Thurmond seemed, like that woman in Iowa, to have surmounted race in favor of political philosophy. I have to think it's a good thing--and too little recognized by those of us who insist we want to be judged by characteristics other than the color of our skins.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But look how these conservatives get beyond race--by supporting African Americans whose views are anathema to the rank and file of black voters. Doesn't that demonstrate their disregard for what black people in general think? Doesn't it suggest that the only way they can forget our race is by supporting black folk who have forgotten it too?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But what would we expect?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That these dyed-in-the-wool conservatives--who oppose a woman's right to choose abortion, who think affirmative action is Satan's own tool and who never saw a new government initiative they didn't hate-- should get out the vote for Jesse Jackson Sr.?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don't mean to suggest that all conservatives have retired their suspicions of racial minorities, or that racism and a certain brand of conservatism have been disentangled. I'm suggesting only that those of us who refuse to believe that white people can be conservative without being against black people may have some disentangling of our own to do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And a modest bit of celebration. For if conservatives--the people we have always viewed as our dedicated enemies--are willing to move beyond our race to consider our character and our philosophy, why there may be hope for white liberals, too.</p>\n"}

Never mind that a majority of Texans like being American citizens; these freedom-fighters aren't big on the fine print of democracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Over three decades, the HRA bombs bars in Austin and Houston, killing about 500 civilians, including (accidents will happen) scores of Mexican immigrants. Its members murder state and federal judges, and any fellow Latinos caught \"collaborating\" with Texas state troopers, including caterers and garbage men. They assassinate over 300 policemen. When Washington activates the National Guard to keep the peace, 700 American servicemen wind up in boxes. And while most decent, hard-working Latinos in Texas don't support the HRA, they also don't mind all the affirmative action coming their way since the ruckus started.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Airport novels must constantly raise the stakes, so we can't have the HRA constraining itself to Texas. Equipped by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, the HRA bombs Wall Street, causing billions of dollars in damage. In fact, the World Trade Center bombing of 1992 could easily be the work of these militants. They mortar-bomb the White House, and make unnervingly near-successful assassination attempts on both Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Is the American public enraged? Quite the opposite: It's bored. Another bombing in El Paso? Big deal. Texas seems far away, and a thorn in the side. Maybe it would be a relief to shed the place, which doesn't even generate much oil revenue anymore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here the plot may take a turn toward the far-fetched: The sitting U.S. president -- let's call him Bartlet -- initiates a \"peace process.\" Laborious negotiations ensue involving the federal government, the Texas chapters of the Democratic and Republican parties, a political front for the HRA, and Mexico. (As to why the U.S. would negotiate with a foreign country over a state in the union, just suspend your disbelief.) Charitably, the HRA offers to refrains from blowing up bars or assassinating presidents. At last they hammer out a deal, to international celebration. No more carnage!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But that's not the end of the story, because \"peace\" doesn't come cheap. Texas is still a star in Old Glory, but the American flag is put out of view in public places lest it alienate Hispanics. A complex bureaucratic apparatus now links Austin and Mexico City to coordinate social policy. President Bartlet doesn't dare sneeze in Texas without asking the Mexican president's permission, and all statements in relation to the Lone Star state are issued jointly with the Mexican government.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It gets weirder: Every HRA sniper and bomber that the FBI apprehended gets to go home, though many have just started life sentences. Picture a swarthier Timothy McVeigh -- who in our page-turner walks off death row a free man, met by a cheering crowd and a pitcher of margarita. The Texas state police force, which did so much to keep the HRA from killing even more people than it did, is drastically downsized and renamed. Made to feel ashamed, droves of experienced anti-terrorist officers retire early. A powerful police ombudsman is imported from Mexico, as is an \"oversight commissioner\" from France. Americans can no longer be trusted to run their own police.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most painfully, HRA leaders are ushered into Texas state government, and a self-confessed HRA commander is awarded the post of commissioner of education. The Texas governor says he can tolerate working with murderers on only one condition: The HRA must destroy at least some of its 100-ton illegal arsenal, which it has kept for a rainy day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, does Mr. Bartlet get tough? No, the president of the U.S. grovels. With no promises from the HRA on disarmament (its representatives have proposed how they might theoretically disarm, but not when), he promises to withdraw the National Guard from Texas and to dismantle its outposts. He announces an amnesty for HRA men on the lam, giving about 60 desperadoes a clean record. He promises the secessionist leadership that convicted felons can infiltrate the Texas police force, and serve on its supervisory board.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All this happens even though a new dissident group is bombing D.C. again. (The \"Real\" HRA comprises disaffected HRA members who still think -- and you can see why, with such an accommodating federal government -- that they can win Texas by force.) Mr. Bartlet dangles the possibility of disbanding the FBI's Domestic Counter-Terrorism Program, which HRA people despise because it's been so effective at catching them red-handed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You seem skeptical. Let killers out of jail, having served only one or two years? Not in the U.S. of A! Convicted murderers in the police, supervising police operations? As if! Decisions on the National Guard and FBI made solely on the basis of demands by a bunch of unelected terrorists? A ridiculous book! It'll never sell.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your mistake. It has sold -- foreign rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair uses the fact that mainland Britons (and Americans) are bored and confused by Northern Ireland. Awkward formulations like \"putting arms beyond use\" -- in deference to terrorists' delicate sensibilities -- and lofty calls for peace disguise the fact that he is selling out his law-abiding countrymen for the sake of short-term expedience. The details of the latest shenanigans -- London's suspension of Belfast's assembly and its resumption 24 hours later, the equally theatrical submission and retraction of a vague IRA \"offer\" to disarm -- are unimportant, though their bureaucratic and rhetorical complexity, for both parties, is usefully obfuscating.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I cling to the conviction that no U.S. president would make major decisions about American security in accordance with the wishes of people like McVeigh. It's unimaginable that Americans would tolerate a commander-in-chief who installed unrepentant terrorists in executive positions of a state government, invited convicted murderers to join and oversee a virtually dismantled state police force, and released wholesale into the community felons after risibly short sentences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Oklahoma City aside, Americans have been lucky with respect to domestic terrorism. As it becomes easier technologically for small groups to cause mass casualties, that luck may not hold. If we ever are subjected to such a movement within our borders, we are likely to look to places like Northern Ireland for solutions, only to discover that the British government has prostrated itself before killers, lavishing a terrorist movement with every political gratuity it can think of -- throwing pearls before swine. Ulster sets a disturbing precedent.

{"id": "txt/2417314051.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Op-Ed: Why California needs affirmative action more than ever</h2<p>In November, a new generation of California voters will have the opportunity to restore affirmative action in the state. Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 will be on the ballot, giving voters the chance to repeal Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education in 1996, nearly a quarter of a century ago.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Supporters of affirmative action hail ACA 5 as a way to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic and gender inequalities, while opponents decry it as a form of categorical discrimination that privileges race and gender over merit. One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating affirmative action will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This view is wrong \u2014 the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on affirmative action. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how affirmative action in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep affirmative action in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard\u2019s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard\u2019s tenured professors are white \u2014 80%.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and most recently \u201ckung flu.\u201d Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support affirmative action: 65% favored or strongly favored affirmative action, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support affirmative action than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of affirmative action, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It\u2019s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-affirmative action laws like Proposition 209 never \u201cleveled the playing field,\u201d but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support affirmative action.

{"id": "txt/1774364135.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Affirmative action for conservatives?</h2<p>Even though we are conservative professors, we've argued publicly that conservative attacks on universities are too often overheated and counterproductive. Nonetheless, liberals shouldn't pretend that academia is untouched by political prejudices. Conservatives do face some bias and are wildly underrepresented in the social sciences; enough, perhaps, to warrant new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to a recent study, only 6.6% of professors in the social sciences self-identify as Republicans (compared with 24.2% in business, 23.3% in engineering, and 22.9% in the health sciences). In sociology, Marxists outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1. Conservative professors are, then, less well represented in the social sciences than women and people of color.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This imbalance is partly attributable to the fact that conservative students steer clear of the social sciences well before they consider graduate programs. One study found that students' politics is among the very best predictors of their undergraduate major choice, with conservatives tending to select the natural sciences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's possible that these conservative undergraduates simply prefer the natural sciences -- some evidence, for example, suggests that they are slightly more focused on financial success than are liberals. But it's also germane that conservatives feel uncomfortable in classes that touch on politics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A climate survey conducted by the University of Colorado found that Republican students were more than three times as likely as their Democratic peers to feel intimidated when sharing their political ideas in class. Another study found that students active in campus conservative groups avoid coursework in the social sciences -- an especially striking discovery given these students' self-evidently strong interest in social and political issues. A third study found that conservatives report less satisfaction with their coursework in the social sciences than do liberal students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We've also found that right-leaning PhD students seem to avoid the most politicized subfields in the social sciences. One young political scientist, for example, told us that she would have preferred to study the Middle East, but opted for a safer subfield instead: \"I didn't do the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which was the thing I wanted to do.\" As one professor of the ancient world -- a safe subfield in history -- explained more generally: \"If you're a conservative, there [are] such huge no-go zones.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The one exception -- that proves the rule -- is economics. Economics has a long history of openness to thinkers on both sides of the political divide and is the one social science field that actually looks like America; it has roughly equal proportions of professors who identify as Republicans, independents and Democrats.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Academic sorting is especially troubling given that the university is one of the only institutions that could model civil discourse for young people in our polarized age, an example that is hard to provide with so few conservatives about. Additionally, a growing number of social scientists are recognizing that political homogeneity makes it hard for humanistic disciplines to converge on the best approximation of the truth; homogenous fields not only generate a narrower range of research interests and interpretations, they are also plagued by confirmation bias -- our tendency to accept findings and theories that fit our assumptions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One liberal argument for affirmative action is sympathetic to these very points. In his 1978 opinion on Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. noted that truth is discovered \"out of a multitude of tongues.\" (He was quoting an earlier decision on another topic.) If Justice Powell is right -- if the primary purpose of affirmative action is to increase the variety of tongues -- then we should increase conservative ones too.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some might reasonably object that the real purpose of affirmative action is to remedy historical discrimination. Universities, however, have long emphasized the virtues of diversity over remedial justice. In fact, liberals embraced the diversity rationale in the 1970s partly because it allowed them to extend affirmative action to new groups -- especially women -- with far weaker historical grievances than African Americans. Today, universities are so committed to diversity -- not remedial justice -- that they are now practicing affirmative action for men so that their campuses don't become even more dominated by female students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Diversity is now the new religion of the university -- and it's one they could practice much better. We don't endorse preferences in graduate admissions and hiring. At a bare minimum, however, universities should stop barring conservative speakers from their campuses. In just the past year, for example, Williams College disinvited two conservative speakers from its \"uncomfortable learning\" series.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In hiring committees, liberal faculty might also question their natural preference for like-minded colleagues. (Progressive professors often say that they prefer to hire liberals, all else being equal.) Before they start sorting through resumes, departments might consider advertising positions in fields that are more popular among conservatives, such as military history, political history, the American founding, sociology of religion and natural law. Scholars in such fields would bring some balance to a curriculum increasingly dominated by race and gender. Finally, universities could grant visiting appointments in conservative thought, an experiment already underway at the University of Colorado.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even these modest reforms should help conservative feel much more welcome in all of academia, not just in some of its quarters. When that happens, the university will also deepen its public legitimacy -- an increasingly rare and fragile good in our polarized age. But that fine achievement depends critically on liberals. As conservative professors, we have defended the progressive university against its polemical right-wing critics. Now we are asking the university to better practice what it preaches.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Jon A. Shields is associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. Joshua M.

{"id": "txt/2832640273.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Self-government is worth defending</h2<p>On this Independence Day, we should reaffirm the twin pillars of democracy: Voters (not the mob) pick their leaders, and elected leaders (not unelected judges) make policy decisions for which they are held accountable. Just as we need to preserve the sanctity of elections (by prosecuting coup instigators), democracy defenders need to address judicial radicals' gross distortion of our system, resulting in the current Supreme Court's subversion of democracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unhinged from judicial standards, the court now roves through the policy landscape, overturning decades of law and reordering Americans' lives and institutions. It upends women's health, revamps college admissions, snatches student aid from millions and redefines public accommodations (allowing egregious discrimination). In aggrandizing power, the court illegitimately dominates policymaking, undermining democracy to an extent we have not seen in nearly 100 years. (Ronald Brownstein pointed out that similar constitutional collisions in the 1850s and 1930s took a civil war or threat of court-packing to resolve.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Something must change if we want to preserve rule by the people's elected leaders responsible to voters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, it is essential to identify the problem. As morally and politically offensive as Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action, LGBTQ+ discrimination and student debt forgiveness might be to millions of Americans, merely criticizing the court's result is misguided and unproductive. The task is to expose the court's disintegration as a legitimate judicial body and note its emergence as a supreme right-wing policymaker. When the court operates on an ends-justify-the-means basis, shreds legal doctrine and dishonestly presents the facts, critics should not play whack-a-mole, decrying each individual rejection of widespread American values. In doing so, the court negates self-government.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One telltale sign that the justices have become partisan politicians: their refusal to adopt mandatory ethics rules, which destroys the essence of judicial impartiality that is the root of their legitimacy. When judges cease to eliminate conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, they appear indistinguishable from politicians wined and dined in rarefied settings by lobbyists. The stench of financial corruption, coupled with justices' intemperate rants in partisan settings and in op-eds, convinces Americans that the justices are partisan players out to score points for their own side.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moreover, the court strays out of its constitutional lane when it refuses to follow consistent rules of construction and honestly address cases' facts. When, for example, the majority casts aside stare decisis (as in the affirmative action case) without admitting it or refuses to apply the test for departing from precedent (as in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization), it is simply muscling its way to desired outcomes because it has the votes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Worse, cases are now manufactured to create policy. The majority has made complete hash out of standing and concepts such as \"case and controversy\" to reach decisions it had no business deciding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the student loan debt relief case, the court created standing out of whole cloth. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, \"The requirement that the proper party \u2014 the party actually affected \u2014 challenge an action ensures that courts do not overstep their proper bounds. \u2026 Without that requirement, courts become 'forums for the ventilation of public grievances' \u2014 for settlement of ideological and political disputes.\" Here the court deliberately ignored that the aggrieved party was not a litigant. Likewise, in the case of a web designer worried about selling her services to a gay couple (who appear to be fabricated), the court defied every principle of standing. When the court goes beyond actual cases and controversies to answer hypotheticals, it goes beyond its constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And, worst of all, the newfangled \"major questions doctrine\" allows the court to subjectively decide when the issue is of \"major political salience\" (whatever the court says it is); if so, the court demands the application at issue be specifically authorized by statute (a standard lawmakers somehow never meet in this court's eyes). It has become a crutch whenever the court seeks to invalidate a program it doesn't like. In the student debt relief case, the court reached the desired result by ignoring the word \"waive\" in the statute authorizing loan forgiveness to reach the finding that Congress hadn't delegated power to, well, waive student debt. \"[T]he Court once again substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch \u2014 and the hundreds of millions of people they represent \u2014 in making this Nation's most important, as well as most contested, policy decisions,\" Kagan wrote.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The mumbo-jumbo \"major questions doctrine\" is not the stuff of judging. No wonder the chief justice got touchy when Kagan pointed out that the court \"is supposed to stick to its business \u2014 to decide only cases and controversies and to stay away from making this Nation's policy about subjects like student-loan relief.\" What the Slaughter-House Cases and substantive due process were to the New Deal-era right-wing court, the \"major questions doctrine\" is to the current court: a smokescreen for enforcing a right-wing agenda (or vetoing a progressive one).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In departing from the authentic judicial review, the right-wing majority unsurprisingly produces results perfectly aligned with the right's agenda on hot-button topics. (By the law of averages, its \"analysis\" should occasionally favor the other side.) When foretelling a case's outcome or following the majority's \"reasoning\" requires a crib sheet on GOP political aims, something is wrong.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And voters have figured out what's going on. According to an ABC News-Ipsos poll, 53 percent \"believe that the nation's highest court rules mainly on the basis of their partisan political view rather than on the basis of the law (33%), while 14% say they don't know.\" Before the Dobbs opinion, a separate January 2022 poll showed that \"38% of Americans believed that the justices rule mainly on the basis of law, versus 43% who believed that the court rules on the basis of their political views.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The transformation of the court into a partisan player contradicts the central premise of democracy. We should reject the obtuse and naive argument that this court isn't so bad because it didn't entirely obliterate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and declined to impose the outrageous independent state legislature doctrine. Now is no time for self-delusion. Ending the right-wing majority's intolerable war on self-government will require that the other two branches and the voters cut the court down to size. A single election or a single reform might not suffice. Cogent law review articles, informed public debate and exquisite dissents revealing that the right-wing judicial emperors have no clothes can assist reformers. Term limits, jurisdiction stripping, court expansion and ethics reform should be on the table. Simply put, if we want democracy to survive, each election must be a referendum on the court's legitimacy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On this Independence Day, which celebrates rebellion against a monarch lacking consent of the governed, it behooves us to dedicate ourselves to robust and authentic democracy \u2014 government of the people, by the people, for the people \u2014 not by arrogant right-wing justices.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2154417607.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Racial Preferences Aren't Only an American Problem; Discriminatory programs tend to benefit the well-off instead of the poor. And they never seem to end.</h2<p>The Paris protesters are getting all the attention, but France isn't the only country where angry masses are taking to the streets to be heard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Journal reported Monday that an estimated 55,000 people gathered in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur last weekend to defend race-based policies that give preferential treatment to the majority Muslim Malay population. Defenders argue that ending racial preferences would \"dilute decades of affirmative action policies introduced to help Malays catch up with the generally wealthier ethnic Chinese,\" who comprise less than a quarter of the population.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Affirmative action in Malaysia began in the 1950s, after the British colonial administrators, who had welcomed laborers from China, departed. Since 1971, Malays have enjoyed preferential treatment over their Chinese compatriots in everything from schooling and housing to government jobs and access to capital. The government's express goal was \"racial balance,\" and to that end Malay entrepreneurs were given preference in obtaining credit, licenses and government contracts. Developers offer Malays discounts on new homes, and shopping centers have even banned ethnic-Chinese-owned businesses to limit competition with Malay proprietors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These policies were supposed to sunset in 1991, but the country's leaders have repeatedly extended them in exchange for political support. \"Schemes favouring Malays were once deemed essential to improve the lot of Malaysia's least wealthy racial group,\" explains the Economist magazine, but \"these days they are widely thought to help mostly the well-off within that group, while failing the poor and aggravating ethnic tensions.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To anyone who has followed the affirmative-action debate in the U.S., a lot of this probably sounds familiar. Like their Malay counterparts, American proponents of racial double standards say they are necessary to help the underprivileged, even though the beneficiaries tend to be people who were already well-off to begin with. Liberal politicians defend color-conscious policies to win votes, and courts assure us the policies will not exist in perpetuity. \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,\" wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in a 2003 Supreme Court decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As it has in Malaysia, affirmative action continues to stoke racial and ethnic tensions in the U.S., especially in education. Harvard is being sued for discrimination against Asian applicants. The plaintiffs say Asians are held to higher standards than other applicants to limit their numbers on campus. Harvard insists that more Asians aren't admitted because they aren't as multidimensional as their non-Asian peers, an argument eerily similar to the one Ivy League schools once used to discriminate against Jews.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has angered the parents of white and Asian students by pushing for racial quotas at the city's top public high schools. Some 80% of black and Hispanic students in New York City's traditional public schools perform below grade level in reading and math. Is it really any wonder that black and Hispanic students are underrepresented at elite schools that use an admission test? Unfortunately, the mayor and his supporters would rather scrap the test than focus on doing a better job of preparing kids to take it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While the debate domestically often centers on the legality of affirmative action and whether it's permitted under our constitution, a more practical concern is whether these policies actually work as intended--here in America or in other countries where they've been implemented. Malaysia's racial preferences have been in place for more than 50 years, and the Malays still haven't caught up to the ethnic Chinese, who outperform them in school and in the workforce. The gap has narrowed over the past half-century, but it remains significant, and attributing Malay progress to affirmative action is dubious. For one thing, Malays in neighboring Singapore, which has no affirmative action and where they are a minority, are better off economically than the Malays in Malaysia, who receive favorable treatment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Similarly, affirmative-action programs in the U.S. are regularly given undeserved credit for expanding the size of the black middle class. The reality is that the most dramatic declines in black poverty preceded affirmative-action programs, which began in earnest in the 1970s. Black incomes doubled in the 1960s--before affirmative action. And blacks were entering middle-class professions at a much faster clip in the decades preceding affirmative action than they did in the decades following its implementation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the University of California system ended race-based admissions in 1996, more blacks enrolled and a higher percentage of them not only graduated but obtained degrees in the more challenging fields of engineering and science. Policies intended to help sometimes do the opposite, whether they are implemented in the U.S. or halfway around the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By Jason L. Riley</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/420033919.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Incendiary hate</h2<p>Being a Chicagoan whose ethnicity has been slurred repeatedly over Chicago Fire Department radio frequencies is bad enough. Being a Chicagoan whose tax dollars helped purchase the microphones, transmitters and speakers via which these hateful, hurtful words have been broadcast, being a Chicagoan whose taxes evidently pay the wages of bigots, that's injury added to the insult.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once again, Chicago has been rocked by charges that some of its firefighters aren't comfortable serving many of the people who live here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The five racist radio transmissions of recent weeks have generated more shock than surprise. The transmissions didn't occur in a void. They follow more than three decades of tension within the department since its ranks were belatedly integrated in 1968.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most of that tension over the years has stayed within the city's firehouses. On rare occasion, citizens have been able to peer inside, or to listen from afar. What they've seen and heard isn't always ennobling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1997, a videotape surfaced depicting a 1990 firehouse retirement party at which firefighters were drinking, exposing themselves and uttering racial slurs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the firefighters who attended the party, James McNally, now is president of Chicago Fire Fighters Union Local 2. On another occasion, he appeared in black face to protest promotions motivated by affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is not to say most Chicago firefighters condone racism. But firefighters--provocateurs and innocents alike--do need to appreciate how grave these five radio incidents are, as is the delivery of a death threat to a battalion chief who heads the African American Fire Fighters League of Chicago.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are times, particularly when the offenders are young or ignorant, when ugly behavior can be forgiven if not forgotten, when its perpetrators can be redeemed if not encouraged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is not one of those times. This behavior, in this department, in this city, is intolerable. There is no wellspring of goodwill upon which an offending firefighter can call, no margin for middling penance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Simply put, these disgusting, dehumanizing incidents follow too much history. Fire Commissioner James Joyce declared last week that \"offenses like these will be fireable offenses.\" Translation: Joyce has committed himself to judging each case individually, but he has put every one of his employees on notice that the range of penalties unquestionably includes dismissal. Mayor Richard Daley concurred, stating that a still unidentified person--thought to be a firefighter--who voiced racial slurs broadcast March 1 should admit his action and face the \"ultimate consequences.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That is the correct response. When these kinds of calculated affronts to city and department policy occur, when reasonable citizens are left to wonder about the integrity of the firefighters they employ, jobs should--must--be on the line.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But whether Joyce can fulfill his own prophecy is another matter. The department terminated seven firefighters who appeared in the 1990 videotape. They challenged the dismissals before an arbitrator and eventually won back their jobs--with pension and seniority rights, the department says, although without four years of back pay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Merely identifying whoever has been spewing filth on fire department frequencies isn't easy. One veteran firefighter who voiced racist slander, and a supervisor who didn't react properly, have been suspended over the first of the five incidents. It's likely the subsequent transmissions originated on fire department radios, but in this era of clever hackers and electronic gadgetry, the department isn't yet certain that no outsider is involved. Joyce, though, hasn't sounded like a boss who expects to learn that his own employees are innocent. Last week he denounced an \"underground Web site\" that offered firefighters tips on how to obscure their identities when transmitting over department frequencies. \"That's what we're up against,\" he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He's also up against an unmeasured amount of denial over society's gradual progress on race. Many of today's Chicago firefighters did come of age in a department culture that to varying degrees rewarded three attributes: skill, courage and clout. Affirmative action, though, is about a fourth, and to some foreign, attribute: fairness. It's understandable, if not admirable, that adding fairness to the mix caused resentment among those who feel that the long-overdue accelerated promotion of minorities--a cause Joyce has advanced--is unfair to some whites who don't get those promotions. What's not understandable is for any Chicago firefighter to permit that or any other frustration to be voiced in the most vicious bigotry imaginable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Firefighters who don't share that bigotry are now in the best position to lead the department out of its difficult past. One important step is to help nail the perpetrators of the radio incidents. Public racism tends to be a team sport. It's likely someone inside or outside the department knows who originated these broadcasts. Stepping forward with that knowledge may require even more courage than racing into a burning house.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But restoring the department's integrity, like rescuing fire victims, is a critical public service. And that cause, public service, should be key to how this sorry drama concludes. Any firefighter who merely wants to fight fire is free to resign and join the U.S. Forest Service. Any firefighter who wants to serve the public--in all its varied hues, in its wide range of good and bad behaviors, in its terrible moments when disaster strikes and panic ensues--is welcome to stay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In short, if a firefighter finds himself risking his own life to save the lives of Chicagoans he finds unworthy of his respect, he should find another job. Fire Commissioner Joyce is right to pursue those few who've let that lack of respect get the best of them. The hope here is that he will root them out, adjudicate their cases under the due process to which they're entitled--and subject them to the ultimate consequences Mayor Daley properly threatened last week.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398288078.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Tales from an Oppressed Class</h2<p>How many white men have been affected by affirmative action -- and how have they reacted? Few experts in the press or academe wanted to probe this most politically incorrect topic until Louisiana's David Duke seized the issue and became a political force.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>General population polls conducted by Gordon Black Associates in 1984 and by the National Opinion Research Center in 1990 suggest that 1-in-10 white men has been injured by affirmative action. This figure alone adds up to millions. Circumstantial evidence suggests even larger numbers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Preferential policies were instituted during an intensely competitive era when huge cohorts of baby boomers crowded job markets increasingly constrained by international competition, lean-and-mean downsizing movements, and tax revolts. Thus, affirmative action often occurred in zero-sum contexts; someone was quota-ed in at another's expense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My research indicates that reverse discrimination's bite has varied by age, geography, occupation, and private or public sector. Most vulnerable have been public-sector white men under the age of 45 with people-oriented skills. Their phone calls flood radio talk-show programs on this topic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many more white men may not have been fully aware that they were being injured by behind-the-scenes tactics such as \"race-norming\" of employment tests by public testing agencies, and many private ones. (The EEOC only recently stopped pressuring corporations to use such procedures.) Nor have they been told of the drive to tie managers' bonuses to affirmative action hiring and promotion records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I became curious about the impact of affirmative action while working in the increasingly quota-crazy higher education systems of California -- where policies moved far beyond the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke dictum that race could be considered as one of several factors in selection processes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>During the 1980s, a state mandate for the community college system (AB1725) ordered a 30% minority-faculty hiring \"goal\" until the year 2005 -- when faculty must mirror the ethnic diversity of the entire state; the University of California began advertising \"targets of diversity\" faculty positions and substantially boosted minority-female representation in administrative staff positions to 72%; and the California State University system implemented set-aside faculty positions, set-aside grant and fellowship programs for graduate students -- while the politically correct faculty union lobbied (successfully) for higher pay for \"underrepresented\" junior faculty. And \"parity goals\" for the entire state work force were monitored in annual reports by the State Personnel Board.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As my quiet interest in affirmative action leaked out -- a professionally dangerous development -- students, colleagues, friends and relative strangers began to report encounters with reverse discrimination. In 1984-85, two graduate assistants and I supplemented this rising tide of informal data -- and scattered press reports -- with 32 in-depth interviews with California-based, mostly middle-class white men who reported that preferential policies prevented them from obtaining jobs or disrupted or ended extant careers. Some findings:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- A community college instructor repeatedly lost tenure-track appointments to less qualified minorities after he moved to California from Michigan. \"At first, you think it's you,\" he said. \"You blame yourself.\" (He finally obtained an appointment at another college.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- A mid-management bank administrator -- and an ardent liberal -- began to have second thoughts as he watched women he'd hired the year before move by him on the affirmative-action fast-track. (Rapid increases in female mid-management employees in his bank and at others lent credence to his account.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- Public-sector workers reported that affirmative action barriers eventually became obvious and quietly acknowledged by most employees. After 13 years of being bypassed by minorities or women, one upper-middle-management California state official reported being offered a promotion -- with some public fanfare -- only to have the appointment rescinded because, as an agency head told him, \"Let's face it, you're not the right color.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most of these men avoided open complaints or protests out of fear they wouldn't be believed or would be labeled racist. (No one said he feared being thought sexist.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Six resigned from the organizations that discriminated against them. Three circumvented reverse discrimination problems through various organizational means. Three filed suits, none of which was successful. No government agency offered redress. (EEOC guidelines effectively insulate employers from reverse discrimination complaints if the employer has taken \"reasonable\" voluntary affirmative action to remedy \"deficiencies\" in minority representation.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The majority of our subjects simply acquiesced in their treatment with varying degrees of bewilderment, resignation or anger. Most subjects voiced temporary, if not long-term, frustration and cynicism about social institutions. \"A lot of us were sold a bill of goods,\" complained a California state middle-management worker. \"We were told if you went to college you could write your own ticket. But . . . affirmative action has lowered standards to the point where education counts against you.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No subject expressed hostility toward minorities per se, but many felt alienated from a society that refused to acknowledge whites' victimization. A teacher, transferred to a distant school in a racial balancing plan, commented: \"My friends couldn't handle this. They experienced cognitive dissonance. They didn't want to be seen as racists.\" Another teacher noted: \"I found out what it was like to be a victim. Nobody likes a victim.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Research sponsored and then suppressed by the Democratic Party in 1985 and 1987 suggests a possible class split in white reactions to affirmative action. Political analyst Stanley Greenberg's \"Report on Democratic Defections\" by blue-collar white \"Reagan Democrats\" in Michigan found fury over quotas for blacks and immigrants. (This anger, Mr. Greenberg concluded, undercut Democratic campaign themes of \"fairness\" and \"justice.\") These data, in combination with the record of lawsuits filed by blue-collar groups (overtly or covertly aided by unions), indicate a more militant, angry working-class response. This is perhaps because of more intense zero-sum problems wrought by a shrinking blue-collar jobs market.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Until Pete Wilson, Jesse Helms and David Duke began to attack quotas in statewide election campaigns last year, a curious bipartisan paralysis thwarted any open political response to rank-and-file whites.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Radicals and liberals have neutralized whites' complaints with swift, categorical denials, such as \"white males can't be victims.\" Indeed, much liberal and multicultural theory today embodies a colorized version of Marx's class struggle. White men (regardless of individual backgrounds) are regarded as a privileged modern-day \"bourgeoisie,\" while women and people of color (again, regardless of individual or subgroup circumstances) are the oppressed \"proletariat.\" Any mention of a white working class -- once prominently represented in labor histories -- is simply met with more rationalizations or with awkward silence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Conservatives have been inclined to dismiss white men's complaints of reverse discrimination because of conservatism's rugged individualistic and free-market underpinnings. White men injured by affirmative action are likely to be told to \"take it like a man\" and get on with their lives. Conservatives are also likely to harbor the assumption that an injured white man can simply quit the offending organization and get another job or start his own business. And there's been more than a hint of class bias. Conservatives are not overly fond of historically Democratic, unionized, white, blue-collar and public-sector workers. Some right-of-center writers have sneered at \"firefighters\" (presumably racist brethren of Archie Bunker) who complain of reverse discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The stereotype of \"racist\" working-class white men has made most journalists, academics and politicians fearful of acquiring a \"racist\" label themselves if they even raise the white-male problem. Thus, most of the recent debate over affirmative action has focused on the safer topics of costs to employers and the stigmatization of officially favored groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unwanted, inadvertent findings about whites and affirmative action have been buried. Just as the Greenberg studies were suppressed in the mid-1980s, a 1990 study by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, designed to provide impetus for the 1991 civil rights bill, was bottled up. News leaks indicated the study uncovered substantial white anger toward affirmative action preferences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One study not buried was the recent, well-publicized Urban Institute study in which matched black/white pairs of job seekers were sent out to test discrimination in hiring. In 67% of the outcomes, neither applicant was offered a job; in 13%, both the black and white applicants were offered the job; in 15% of the cases, only the white applicant was offered the job, while in 5% of the cases the black received the offer-indicating only minimal levels of reverse discrimination. However, the institute study ignored the public sector entirely, as well as people-oriented, liberal-arts types of jobs. Would the institute be willing to dispatch black/white teams to apply for openings in California state agencies? In universities?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Affirmative action's impact upon white males must also be viewed as a legitimate topic of discussion if we are to understand how these policies have both functioned and malfunctioned. An earlier, fair hearing of whites' complaints might have led to the recognition that, in practice, affirmative action has become what George Will has aptly termed a racial spoils system with all attendant corruptions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lingering white racism is to be condemned. But it is unjust and inaccurate to automatically attribute whites' criticisms of flawed policies to racism. Further suppression will only obscure troubling realities and lead to emotional exploitation of an important topic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Lynch is visiting associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California, and author of \"Invisible Victims: White Males and the Crisis of Affirmative Action\" (Praeger Paperbacks, 1991).</p>\n"}

There are 36 possible pairs of justices, and in the term just concluded something interesting happened.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The top three spots were all taken by pairs of women. However you matched them up, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan voted together at least 93 percent of the time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The alignments are a product of ideology, not biology. \"They are the three most liberal justices on the court, and it makes sense that they would often be in agreement,\" said Pamela Harris, an adviser to the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown's law school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The voting pattern highlighted the rightward drift of the fourth member of the court's liberal wing, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who broke from his usual allies in a series of important privacy cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In past years, it was often the conservative justices who voted together the most: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., say, or Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. This year, the right was more fractured. (The statistics come from Scotusblog, and the trends hold whether you look at all cases or just divided ones.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The three female justices also dominated Supreme Court arguments in the last term. Justice Ginsburg asked the first question 37 percent of the time. Justice Sotomayor asked the most questions, averaging more than 21 in each hourlong argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justice Kagan, a former dean of Harvard Law School and a former United States solicitor general, by many accounts asked the best questions of any of the justices. They were crisp and conversational and probed the heart of the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The spotlight often captured Justice Sotomayor this term, as her best-selling memoir gave rise to a book tour that drew adoring crowds. She was profiled on \"60 Minutes,\" talked with Oprah Winfrey and Jon Stewart, and visited \"Sesame Street\" and \"The View.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lawyers who appear before her say she is a source of inspiration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I think she has come into her own and is establishing herself as a formidable and independent presence,\" said Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter in Washington who has argued 33 cases before the court and served as a law clerk to Justice Ginsburg. \"Like the other two women, she's very comfortable up there, and that's a great thing for a woman like me to see.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Asked by e-mail for an assessment of Justice Sotomayor, a normally sober political scientist did not stint on her exclamation points.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"People love her!\" wrote Lee Epstein, who teaches at the University of Southern California. \"She made a lot of money!\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justice Sotomayor's financial disclosure forms show that she has received more than $3 million for the book.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justice Ginsburg's form for last year also contained an interesting disclosure. In November, she accepted an \"award recipient gift bag\" worth $2,500 -- a swag bag, in the lingo -- when she received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In their day jobs, the votes of the three justices are neither wholly predictable nor wholly united, said Lisa T. McElroy, a law professor at Drexel University.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"It's important to note that the agreement was not on 'women's' or 'social justice' issues,\" she said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The female justices were divided in two of the term's biggest cases, Professor McElroy added. Justice Sotomayor wanted to provide an answer to whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, while the other two women said the court was powerless to decide the question in the context of a challenge to California's ban on the practice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor also split on affirmative action, with Justice Ginsburg filing the lone dissent in a case that sent a challenge to the University of Texas's affirmative action plan back to the lower courts for a second look under a more demanding standard. (Justice Kagan, who worked on the case as solicitor general, recused herself.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at University of California, Irvine, \"they are the three most liberal justices on the court, and so it is not surprising given their ideological similarity that they vote together the most.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justice Breyer, the next most liberal justice, voted with conservative justices in a decision allowing the police to take DNA samples from arrestees and in dissents from rulings limiting the use of police dogs to sniff for drugs outside homes and warrantless blood testing of people stopped for drunken driving.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In all three cases, he and Justice Scalia traded places, with Justice Scalia joining the three women in pressing for broad Fourth Amendment protections.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I ought to be the pinup of the criminal defense bar,\" Justice Scalia told an audience at the University of Wyoming in October. He had been hunting in Wyoming, with Justice Kagan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justice Scalia described their trip in an interview in February with Nina Totenberg at George Washington University.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"It was, unfortunately, not successful,\" he said. \"We got antelope tags, which are expensive for out of state, and mule deer tags. Didn't get a single shot at an antelope or a mule deer. So she ended up killing a white-tailed doe, which she could have done in my driveway.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"She dropped that doe with one shot,\" he said of Justice Kagan's exercise of her Second Amendment rights. \"Boom. Just like that.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justice Scalia is also close to Justice Ginsburg, but there are limits to their friendship. \"I can't imagine Ruth hunting,\" he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From Left, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan.

{"id": "txt/2635873593.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Judge Jackson Could Change the Court</h2<p>In 1992, months after Justice Thurgood Marshall retired from the Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor published an appreciative essay in the Stanford Law Review titled \"The Influence of a Raconteur.\"She described sitting at the justices' conference table with the older man, a hero of the civil rights movement and the first Black justice, listening to the stories he told from his action-filled life. The experiences he recounted were \"a source of amazement and inspiration,\" she wrote, not only for what they revealed about him \"but also because of what they instill in, and ask, of us.\" She said she found herself \"hoping to hear, just once more, another story that would, by and by, perhaps change the way I see the world.\"I was touched by the essay when I first read it, but also puzzled. If I had been asked to name justices who were immune to Thurgood Marshall's influence, Justice O'Connor, who had been on the court for 11 years and had served with him for 10 years, would have been on the list. She opposed affirmative action, and her states'-rights orientation made her antagonistic to federal court review of state criminal justice issues. I was taken aback by her first line in a 1991 majority opinion that rejected an appeal from an inmate on Virginia's death row. \"This is a case about federalism,\" she declared. Justice Marshall dissented.And yet. By the time of her own retirement in 2006, Justice O'Connor was in a very different place. She wrote the majority opinion that preserved affirmative action in university admissions. She modulated her views on federalism. It would be ridiculous to ascribe Justice O'Connor's migration in late middle age solely to the influence of Justice Marshall, who died in 1993. But it would be equally ridiculous to discount his influence entirely. Why not take her at her word? She must have sensed something in 1992, a pull in a different direction.Could President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, assuming her confirmation, inspire any of her new colleagues to see the world in a different way?There doesn't seem to be a Sandra Day O'Connor lurking within today's carefully constructed conservative supermajority, and the heroic trajectory of Thurgood Marshall's life is not Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's story. It's fair to say that she has more in common with the justice she has been named to replace. Like Stephen Breyer, she was a star student at an excellent public high school. Her father, like his, worked as a lawyer for a big-city school board (Miami in her case, San Francisco in his). Success at Harvard Law School propelled them both to a Supreme Court clerkship (in fact, she clerked for him). Justice Breyer is often referred to as the father of the federal sentencing guidelines and served on the original United States Sentencing Commission, where she later served as vice chair.In drawing these parallels, I have deliberately not emphasized race. Yes, her nomination fulfills the president's campaign promise to appoint a Black woman, the first to sit on the Supreme Court. While that's cause for celebration, it shouldn't obscure the other kinds of diversity she would bring to the court.Diversity has many dimensions, perspective among them. That she would be the first former public defender to sit on the court has received wide notice, less so the fact that as a public school graduate she would be a rarity among the justices. Justice Breyer's departure will leave only two, Elena Kagan, who attended the highly selective Hunter College High School in Manhattan, hardly a typical public school, and Samuel Alito, who went to Steinert High School in Hamilton Township, N.J., near Trenton, his hometown. Every other member of the court is a graduate of a Catholic high school, a striking but little-observed fact at a time when cases concerning public and religious schools and the relationship between the two are prominent on the court's docket.Justice Breyer's wife, Joanna, is a clinical psychologist who during her active career specialized in working with children being treated for cancer at the Lahey Clinic in Boston. Does having a medical professional in the family account for Justice Breyer's emphasis on facts and evidence in his opinions on medical subjects? With medical questions hardly about to disappear from the court's docket, it's worth noting that Judge Jackson's husband, Patrick, is a surgeon. (Justice Sonia Sotomayor's brother, Juan, is a doctor with an allergy practice in upstate New York.) Some conservative justices seem to assume that doctors don't act in the interest of their patients, whether performing abortions or administering vaccines. Maybe Judge Jackson will be able to persuade them otherwise.Or maybe not, but my point is that we cheat ourselves out of a full appreciation of what a person brings to the court if race is our only focus. On the day of Judge Jackson's nomination, Curt Levey, president of the right-wing interest group Committee for Justice, put out a statement that was as preposterous as it was predictable. \"Jackson should be asked about her views on race,\" the statement said, adding that \"at a time when a major affirmative action case is on the Supreme Court's docket and our nation is debating whether equality or equity should be the governing anti-discrimination standard, we hope that senators will ask Judge Jackson about her views on equity, racial preferences, disparate impact and the like.\"Maybe it's only white nominees who are not expected to answer questions about pending cases. Maybe I missed other news releases from the Committee for Justice, but I don't remember Mr. Levey asking senators to drill down on the views on racial issues held by President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court nominees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Don't white Supreme Court nominees also have a race?Thurgood Marshall, born into segregation in 1908, was already a Supreme Court justice when Ketanji Brown was born 62 years later. She will walk through the doors that he opened. But her life story is not without power. She thrived at an integrated high school -- most public schools in the United States remain racially segregated -- where she was class president and a star debater, despite the lowered expectations that white administrators had for her.Her parents attended historically Black colleges, building a solid middle-class life for their children's future. Her teenage dream was to be a judge. By 2012, when the country had a president determined to diversify the federal courts, Judge Jackson had walked through every open door and was ready for Barack Obama.It's a quintessentially American success story. Thinking about what her role on the court might be, is it fanciful to suppose that some of her colleagues, age mates who checked the same boxes on their way to the top, might look at Ketanji Brown Jackson and see themselves? Perhaps in the very familiarity of her path to the Supreme Court -- a story that to others might look extraordinary -- might lie its ability to inspire, or at least to prompt conservatives who are sure of what they think to think again. No, I don't expect her to change the court. But she may well change the conversation, and that's a start.The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

{"id": "txt/434126284.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Meet The New Elite, Not Like The Old</h2<p>-- They are the children of 1969 -- the year that America's most prestigious universities began aggressively recruiting blacks and Latinos to their nearly all-white campuses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No longer would Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Columbia be the domain of the privileged. Instead, in response to the national soul-searching prompted by the civil rights movement, America's premier colleges would try to become more representative of the population as a whole.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Forty years later, America is being led, to a striking extent, by a new elite, a cohort of the best and the brightest whose advancement was formed, at least in part, by affirmative action policies. From Barack and Michelle Obama (Columbia, Princeton, Harvard) to Eric Holder (Columbia) to Sonia Sotomayor (Princeton, Yale) to Valerie Jarrett (Michigan, Stanford),  the country  is now seeing, in full flower, the fruition of this wooing of  minorities to institutions that for much of the nation's history have groomed America's leaders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And yet the consequences of that change remain unresolved, as became  clear on Friday, when Mr. Obama grappled a second time with the arrest of the Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his own home.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The incident, the president said, offered the potential to soothe  longstanding distrust between minorities and police officers. But it also laid bare another reality, that the children of 1969, even those who now occupy niches at the top of society, regard their status as complicated, ambiguous and vulnerable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Whether I were black or white, I think that me commenting on this and hopefully contributing to constructive -- as opposed to negative -- understandings about the issue, is part of my portfolio,\" Mr. Obama said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was a reminder that Mr. Obama, in addition to being the most powerful American, is also the fulfillment of the ideals embraced by Ivy League minority recruiters in 1969. Mr. Gates entered Yale that year, as one of 96 black freshmen. Today that number seems small. But there had been only six black students just three years before.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Gates belonged to the first affirmative action wave at top universities -- a wave that continued into the 1970s and the 1980s. I was one of its beneficiaries. A black 17-year-old from Monrovia, Liberia, I was one of some 200 black freshmen at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1983.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My first roommate was a white student from Seagrove, N.C., whose SAT scores and grade-point average were higher than mine. Privately, I consoled myself that I had qualifications that she didn't: I could name the capital of every country in Africa; countries she had never heard of. I knew where the Zambezi River emptied into the Indian Ocean. None of that had been on the SAT.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But every now and then I feared I was faking it, that my white classmates had something I didn't. There were things they seemed to know instinctively, that I had to look up. I remember  getting laughed at during a game of Pictionary when I couldn't come up with the word for a giant bird landing on a lawn with a baby in its mouth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My feelings of inadequacy were not unusual, said David L. Evans, the Saturn/Apollo electrical engineer hired by Harvard in 1969 to help lead its affirmative action program. When Mr. Evans visited public high schools in Arkansas in search of promising black students, he was met with skepticism. \"Even people who didn't have any mean-spiritedness would say to the students, 'You going to be up there with the Kennedys?' \" he recalled. \" 'How do you think you can make it there?' \"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There was  anxiety, too, among  the originators of race-based affirmative action programs. \"The idealistic version of why these universities embraced racial affirmative action is that they said, 'Hey, we're in the business of training elites, it would be better for America if there were a diverse elite,' \" said Nicholas Lemann,  dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and  author of \"The Big Test,\" a history of the SAT and the rise of America's meritocracy. To its architects, the minority recruitment was the next phase for universities that for years had paved the way for whites, particularly the offspring of upper-class alumni, Mr. Lemann said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The cynical version of why they did this is they said, 'We can't control this country, it's becoming too diverse, we need to socialize the brighter minorities and make them more like us.' \"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In many ways, being molded into people \"more like us\" gave the children of 1969 an advantage denied most of their white counterparts. They learned to navigate within a second world. They also absorbed some of its ideas and values. And they paved the way for the next generation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"We had to go through this phase of larger integration for Barack Obama to be possible,\" Mr. Gates said in an interview a few days  after his arrest. \"It would have been impossible for Barack Obama to go from a historic black school to become president, at this time. The whole point is that a broad swath of America had to be able to identify with him.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It also enabled Mr. Obama to run \"the most race-blind campaign\" of any black presidential candidate, said Gwen Ifill, the PBS news reporter whose book \"The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama\" examines the rise of African-Americans in politics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Perhaps. But the children of 1969 dwell in a complex world. They retain  an ethnic identity that includes its own complement of cultural, historical and psychological issues and considerations. This emerged at Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearings. And it emerged again last week, when Mr. Obama joked in the White House East Room that if he ran afoul of the police, \"I'd get shot.\" In saying this, he seemed to draw on the fears of black men across the United States, including those within the new power elite.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What Mr. Obama seemed to be demonstrating was what Mr. Lemann of Columbia calls a \"double consciousness\" that allows the children of 1969 to flow more easily between the world which their skin color bequeathed them and the world which their college degree opened up for them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's the same double consciousness I acquired at U.N.C., though I didn't think about it that way as a student. Sure, my white friends were learning a little more about black (and African) culture from me. But I was absorbing much more from them, since they surrounded me in such great number. At the time it seemed I had the advantage;   I would leave college having gotten much more from my interactions with my white friends than they could possibly have gotten from me. And the principal thing I learned was how to make them feel at ease around me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Except, of course, on those occasions when one can't. Life outside the university doesn't duplicate the conditions of university life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I can't wear my Harvard gown everywhere I go,\" Professor Gates said. \"We -- all of us in the crossover generation -- have multiple identities, and being black trumps all of those other identities.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On Friday Mr. Obama said he hoped Mr. Gates's incident might become a \"teachable moment.\" It is a daunting task for the children of 1969: finding out whether the double consciousness they honed in the Ivy League can actually get this country to listen -- and react -- to race in a different way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>HELENE COOPER           Helene Cooper, a White House correspondent for The Times, is the author of \"The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Princeton: Sonia Sotomayor.

Politicians who roam the halls of the nearby state Capitol went ballistic. \"This is not the kind of academic riffraff that our taxpayers should be supporting,\" argued an African-American state senator from Dallas. A Hispanic colleague of his wrote University of Texas Chancellor William Cunningham to argue that Graglia's remarks \"amount to cultural character assassination\" and should not \"be protected by academic freedom.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reactionary students who also value political correctness more than open debate called for Graglia's dismissal. And knees wobbling, even the law school faculty disassociated itself from their colleague's remarks. Some genuflected in the direction of free speech, to be sure, but the emphasis was on disagreeing with Graglia without actually pinpointing why.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And therein lies an important point: Today, Americans who are supposed to be the stewards of our political and academic traditions are still debating whether there should be free speech, rather than accepting that right as a given and using it as a tool for seriously addressing the major public policy questions of the day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In truth, Graglia's concern about the underachievement of minorities at \"selective institutions\" was not unfounded. Hispanics and blacks are not doing as well as mainstream students, a point made long ago by Hoover Institution senior fellow Thomas Sowell, who is black. Likewise, scholars have noted that certain Asian-American groups appear to have a culture that does produce high academic achievement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Graglia has a right to oppose affirmative action, which was the real object of his opinions. But where he erred was in leaving room for the interpretation that minority underachievement is inescapable because minorities are by definition underachievers. Leaving aside the issue of tautologies, isn't it likely that disparate socioeconomic circumstances might be a relevant factor? Doesn't the disproportionate convergence of race and poverty have a bearing on minority achievement in America today? Isn't chronic low-skill immigration in states such as Texas to be considered as a factor?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Graglia may wish to recall American history. During the third great wave of immigration to the United States earlier in this century, low-skill immigrants from places like rural Italy came in for an enormous amount of prejudice and discrimination because it was assumed that being poor and uneducated they could not improve themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Over time, however, a number of factors came together to catapult millions of Italian-Americans into the mainstream. They became mayors, governors, Cabinet members and federal judges. Is it just possible that Graglia might soften his views toward Hispanics against such a backdrop? Is it possible that he might consider that racism and other factors have played a disproportionate role in keeping blacks down?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was having lunch in Santa Monica, Calif., the other day after a panel discussion on immigration, race and education, when I heard an articulate person at my table say that bigots needed to be shown up for what they are, or else they may be taken seriously. There is some truth in that, but it also seems to me that people who can't identify a bigot on their own or who are prone to allege bigotry where none exists are nearly as dangerous as the bigot. That is precisely why the country is more in need of education through dialogue rather than exhortation, peroration or condemnation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of all people, President Clinton needs to be reminded that such a dialogue must take in a variety of points of view. But on issues of race, don't look for nuance from Clinton. \"Those kinds of remarks don't go down well with the president, period,\" said White House press secretary Mike McCurry in condemning Graglia's opinions out of hand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yes, Graglia hurt a lot of people's feelings in how he said what he said. In ignoring America's past and overlooking the redemptive promise this country has held out to groups that have triumphed over time after having started at the bottom, the truth about impoverished minorities and their potential has eluded him. Even so, he deserves tolerance from a society willing to engage in a complicated discussion where hurt feelings are inevitable.</p>\n"}

The great secret is out: Liberals dominate campuses. Coming soon: \"Moon Implicated in Tides, Studies Find.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One study of 1,000 professors finds that Democrats outnumber Republicans at least seven to one in the humanities and social sciences. That imbalance, more than double what it was three decades ago, is intensifying because younger professors are more uniformly liberal than the older cohort that is retiring.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another study, of voter registration records, including those of professors in engineering and the hard sciences, found nine Democrats for every Republican at Berkeley and Stanford. Among younger professors, there were 183 Democrats, six Republicans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But we essentially knew this even before the American Enterprise magazine reported in 2002 on examinations of voting records in various college communities. Some findings about professors registered with the two major parties or with liberal or conservative minor parties:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cornell: 166 liberals, 6 conservatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stanford: 151 liberals, 17 conservatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Colorado: 116 liberals, 5 conservatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>UCLA: 141 liberals, 9 conservatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics reports that in 2004, of the top five institutions in terms of employee per capita contributions to presidential candidates, the third, fourth and fifth were Time Warner, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft. The top two were the University of California system and Harvard, both of which gave about 19 times more money to John Kerry than to George W. Bush.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at Berkeley, denies that academic institutions are biased against conservatives. The disparity in hiring, he explains, occurs because conservatives are not as interested as liberals in academic careers. Why does he think liberals are like that? \"Unlike conservatives, they believe in working for the public good and social justice.\" That clears that up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A filtering process, from graduate school admissions through tenure decisions, tends to exclude conservatives from what Mark Bauerlein calls academia's \"sheltered habitat.\" In a dazzling essay in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Bauerlein, professor of English at Emory University and director of research and analysis at the National Endowment for the Arts, notes that the \"first protocol\" of academic society is the \"common assumption\" -- that, at professional gatherings, all the strangers in the room are liberals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is a reasonable assumption, given that in order to enter the profession, your work must be deemed, by the criteria of the prevailing culture, \"relevant.\" Bauerlein says that various academic fields now have regnant premises that embed political orientations in their very definitions of scholarship:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Schools of education, for instance, take constructivist theories of learning as definitive, excluding realists (in matters of knowledge) on principle, while the quasi-Marxist outlook of cultural studies rules out those who espouse capitalism. If you disapprove of affirmative action, forget pursuing a degree in African-American studies. If you think that the nuclear family proves the best unit of social well-being, stay away from women's studies.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This gives rise to what Bauerlein calls the \"false consensus effect,\" which occurs when, because of institutional provincialism, \"people think that the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population.\" There also is what Cass Sunstein, professor of political science and jurisprudence at the University of Chicago, calls \"the law of group polarization.\" Bauerlein explains: \"When like-minded people deliberate as an organized group, the general opinion shifts toward extreme versions of their common beliefs.\" They become tone-deaf to the way they sound to others outside their closed circle of belief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When John Kennedy brought to Washington such academics as Arthur Schlesinger Jr., John Kenneth Galbraith, McGeorge and William Bundy and Walt Rostow, it was said that the Charles River was flowing into the Potomac. Actually, Richard Nixon's administration had an even more distinguished academic cast -- Henry Kissinger, Pat Moynihan, Arthur Burns, James Schlesinger and others.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Academics such as the next secretary of state still decorate Washington, but academia is less listened to than it was. It has marginalized itself, partly by political shrillness and silliness that have something to do with the parochialism produced by what George Orwell called \"smelly little orthodoxies.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many campuses are intellectual versions of one-party nations -- except such nations usually have the merit, such as it is, of candor about their ideological monopolies. In contrast, American campuses have more insistently proclaimed their commitment to diversity as they have become more intellectually monochrome.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They do indeed cultivate diversity -- in race, skin color, ethnicity, sexual preference. In everything but thought.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>georgewill@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/421118533.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>PERSPECTIVE ON MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.; A Visionary With More Than a Dream; Today's fuzzy icon had many practical ideas for improving the lot of blacks, some now taken for granted.</h2<p>The four words, \"I have a dream,\" seared into the nation's consciousness by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. almost 34 years ago, have been both a blessing and a curse. To many, they are a beacon still calling to the country. To others, they have indelibly tagged King as a hopeless utopian with lofty visions of ending war, racism and poverty, but with no concrete program to achieve these aims. No wonder the man we celebrate today has practically been turned into a harmless, badly outdated icon.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But he isn't. In a work largely ignored when it was published 30 years ago and all but unknown today, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?,\" King turned from dreamer to problem solver. But before we look at those ideas, there are two huge caveats.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, recasting the words of a historic figure to fit present situations must be avoided. This type of dangerous ideological revisionism was shamefully evident in the contentious debate over Proposition 209 in California. Both sides exploited and deliberately distorted the few stray remarks that King uttered on what is known today as affirmative action, a concept just beginning to take shape in the 1960s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The second caveat is that King can't be fitted into a neat ideological box. There is enough paradox and ambivalence in King's positions for liberals and conservatives to praise and damn. At various times, he railed against and embraced black militants. He applauded violent anti-colonial and national liberation movements and championed nonviolent change. Paradox and ambivalence also marked his private life. As a man of God, his moral lashing of America was wildly at odds with his questionable sexual conduct. Not surprisingly, King's solutions to many of the big-ticket racial and class problems that plagued America were a mix of idealism and pragmatism, which people faulted for lacking a clear direction. King can't be blamed for that. Three decades after his death, America is still no closer to solving these problems.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The black family crisis. King branded the black family \"fragile, deprived and often psychopathic.\" While he could have been criticized for giving weight to negative myths and stereotypes about black families, King was correct in targeting father absenteeism in the black home as a major ill. He made the standard liberal call for more government-funded job, education and skills training programs. But he also recognized the importance of values like training, discipline, hard work and the reduction of family violence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Educational neglect. King did not believe that more funds, smaller classrooms and better textbooks alone would solve the crisis of the classroom. He called on teachers and administrators to rededicate themselves to the ideal of quality education, and for parents to get more involved in their children's education. King's proposal for \"educational parks,\" a kind of multifaceted complex for teaching basic skills as well as advanced studies, anticipated the idea of magnet schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Political apathy. Exercising the right to vote and electing blacks were not enough for King. He challenged black officeholders to be \"independent and assertive\" in fighting for legislation to improve the plight of the black poor and for black organizations to build political alliances with labor and other ethnic groups based on the needs and interests they have in common.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Corporate racism. The campaign against discrimination in hiring and promotions that followed the Texaco scandal closely followed a four-step plan outlined by King. It included more jobs and promotions, selected buying campaigns, boycotts and organized protests, negotiations and the monitoring of any agreement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Economic empowerment. King often quipped that it was futile to integrate a lunch counter if blacks couldn't afford to buy a meal. He demanded huge increases in federal funding for job and skills training programs. But he also recognized that government couldn't or shouldn't be expected to do it all. He called for \"black dollar days\" in which blacks purchased goods and services from black businesses and deposited their savings in black-owned banks. In turn, King expected black entrepreneurs to recycle those dollars into education, recreation and social programs for the black poor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Crime and violence. King understood that the destructive cycle of drugs, crime and violence destabilized black communities. While his first priority was, as always, more government-funded job and education programs, he also stressed family values, personal responsibility and discipline. He urged black professionals to give more of their time and money to employment, educational and recreational programs aimed at \"saving\" at-risk black youth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Welfare. King agreed that reliance on welfare could breed dependency and discourage personal initiative. He proposed that the government provide direct tax subsidies and tax incentives to corporations to hire and train unskilled workers. This idea was a forerunner of today's federally backed enterprise and empowerment zones. He also called for the creation of \"second chance universities\" to train welfare recipients and the unemployed to compete in the technological job market.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By today's standards, King's agenda may seem piecemeal and patchwork. Almost all of his ideas have been either implemented, tried and discarded or discredited. But so what? King didn't just dream of a new world, he died fighting for it. And in an era when politicians and community leaders believe that grabbing a photo-op or popping a sound-bite is leadership, King's vision and program still looks and sounds better than anything they offer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTO: EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of \"Beyond O.J.: Race, Sex and Class in America.\" E-mail: ehutchi344@aol.com</p>\n"}

The growing number of jobs lost to this crafty creature that seems to be nowhere and everywhere at once is startling enough to make us question our assumptions about how to plan a future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If the goal was once to ensure a college education for everyone, the more prudent policy now might be to help people develop skills related to outdoor work and other physically demanding jobs. Chatbots can write, but they can't change a lightbulb. They can't plumb a house. They can't heal the sick with a human touch or grow vegetables or perform countless other jobs that fill humanity's most crucial needs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For the confused, \"GPT\" stands for \"generative pre-trained transformer,\" which refers to how ChatGPT processes, requests and formulates responses. ChatGPT is trained via reinforcement and reward models that rank the best responses. Something like that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While the reasoning behind the high court's 6-3 decision on affirmative action is best left to lawyers - speaking of replaceable professions - the implications of the explosive expansion of AI into new arenas should be obvious to anyone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>During a visit with my son, I brought up the subject of AI, and he quickly begged for a subject change. \"I don't want to talk about it,\" he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Why not?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Because it upsets me.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he has reason to be worried. A writer with a law degree, he depends on regular clients to earn a living. He's fine for now, thanks to his unique niche, but other writers similarly situated have lost their entire client lists overnight.

Is anyone not transitioning these days?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fein has returned to school to become an HVAC technician. Another displaced writer, this one in San Francisco, has started a job as a dog walker.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Amid the disruption, irony remains fully employed. Is technology, in replacing humans, also making us more human? More time spent outdoors is surely healthier than sitting at a desk for hours a day. If more people turn to skilled labor, might we finally be able to find dependable help on household troubles beyond our ken?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A forthcoming \"wearable AI assistant\" from a company called Humane is meant to revolutionize both technology and humanity. Imran Chaudhri, Humane's co-founder and chairman, describes his pocket-size invention as intentionally humanizing, because it eliminates the need for devices - smart phones, watches, even computers - that act as barriers to human interaction. Chaudhri's device performs the functions of all the above and more, using the palm of the hand as a display screen so your face is free to express emotions, make eye contact and, not least, see where you're going.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Such developments are both frightening and exhilarating. The possibilities for liberation and creativity are limited only by the imagination. But the threat to life as we know it - and especially to white-collar (or work-at-home-hoodie) jobs - is potentially catastrophic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the bright side, AI isn't always so smart. Or, rather, it's smart in a Vulcan way. All brain, no emotion, makes for a lousy human. Writers can be replaced if all you need is a user manual, but AI doesn't have the emotional depth or experiential memory to write beautifully, using just the right word or nuance. An algorithm might come up with the likeliest word used by most people most of the time, but a good writer knows better ones. Voice and style are as individual as a fingerprint.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At least one of Fein's clients has realized that his content was better than AI's and has returned. Others decided that the quality sacrifice was worth the cost savings. Humans, after all, need steady salaries and health benefits, vacations, sick days and family leave. AI needs nothing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We can't at this point see exactly how AI might evolve. We know instinctively that the good often is shadowed by the bad. How many ways will we regret our eager embrace of machine over man? Of such is science fiction written, though I suspect AI would be a lousy author. Great literature comes to us from people who have dug deep into their psyches, experiences, sorrows, triumphs, fears, losses and aspirations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I do wonder about all the folks who no longer will be admitted to colleges and universities because they don't meet certain data-driven standards and, therefore, won't have the opportunity to study humankind's greatest achievements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The immediate losers will be the students of color who might have benefited from affirmative action. But in the longer run, the real loser might well be academia. Young men already have abandoned college in huge numbers, leaving women to dominate in many fields that AI loves. Add Black and Brown young people to decreasing enrollments and who's left? And who will teach? AI, I'm afraid.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court says affirmative action belongs to another generation and is no longer needed. It would be nice to think so, but my hunch is that many Americans would agree with Suzanne Szostak, co-innkeeper of Mine + Farm, my favorite getaway here in Sonoma County. Commenting on the ruling, she said, \"I just wish the Supreme Court was an AI chatbot right now.\"</p>\n"}

The Piscataway case was a difficult one with unusual facts. The teachers, hired the same day, had equal seniority and comparable qualifications.

{"id": "txt/422176235.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Who's the hypocrite?; It's not fair to use affirmative action against Clarence Thomas.</h2<p>With the release of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' memoir, \"My Grandfather's Son,\" all of the old smears directed against him since his confirmation hearings 16 years ago are once again being trotted out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That he's \"incompetent.\" That he's \"not qualified.\" That the only reason he was appointed is because he's black. In other words, that he's a product of affirmative action or, more precisely, an \"affirmative action hire.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last week, for instance, liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote: \"I believe in affirmative action, but I have to acknowledge there are arguments against it. One of the more cogent is the presence of Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Robinson's comment echoes many previous attacks. In 2000, for example, Newsweek columnist Anna Quindlen -- another liberal who has written in support of affirmative action -- declared that Thomas' \"judicial resume was mediocre; he was chosen because he was conservative and black, an affirmative action hire by an administration that eschewed affirmative action.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many liberal Democrats aren't willing to say out loud what Robinson and Quindlen wrote so clearly. After all, they're conditioned to defend racial preferences, which they insist do not promote \"incompetent\" or \"unqualified\" people. But that doesn't mean they don't think it. Even The American Prospect magazine, a liberal journal that sees its mission as \"beating back the right wing,\" ran an article two years ago calling Thomas the \"most visible affirmative action hire in all the land, a token black nominee whose lack of qualifications was so painfully outed during his confirmation hearings.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How can you support a policy of racial preferences and then attack one of its supposed beneficiaries as undeserving? This, ultimately, is the intrinsic hypocrisy of the Thomas bashers. They allege that he's not competent and that the only reason he became a Supreme Court justice was because he's black. And in so doing, they level the exact same arguments against Thomas that they castigate conservatives for making about affirmative action itself. But let's face facts: A program that gives people with a certain skin color an advantage will invariably reward some who would otherwise not qualify.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This blatant intellectual inconsistency does not stop Thomas' liberal critics from accusing him of hypocrisy -- namely, for being the \"most visible affirmative action hire in all the land\" while simultaneously standing as its most prominent black opponent. By opposing racial preferences, liberals say, Thomas -- who was accepted into Yale Law School via an affirmative action program -- is denying others the very same benefits he received.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But as Thomas reveals in \"My Grandfather's Son,\" his opposition to racial preferences is based on personal conscience and a genuine concern for its effects on black Americans, not selfish disregard for his racial brethren born out of self-loathing, as affirmative action advocates would have it. He writes that he keeps his Yale diploma tucked away in his basement with a 15-cent cigar sticker affixed to its frame. Why? In a \"60 Minutes\" interview, Thomas said \"that degree meant one thing for whites and another thing for blacks. . . . It was discounted.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is one of the tragic legacies of racial preferences -- that the achievements of black people in the professional world will always be suspect, and not just to blacks who benefit from such preferences. In the minds even of liberals, blacks will always be thought of as \"affirmative action hires\" no matter how bright or qualified they are.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It may be difficult for well-intentioned white liberals to understand the personal insecurity that affirmative action causes, and as a white person, I can only take someone like Thomas at his word when he writes about the shame he feels because of racial preferences. But as a gay man, I can certainly empathize, as I imagine I would feel exactly the same way if sexual orientation became a \"plus factor\" in a law school or employment application process. Factoring in a person's immutable traits demeans them and robs them of their individuality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whether or not Thomas is qualified to be a Supreme Court justice, who are affirmative action advocates to smear him as an affirmative action hire? (Can you imagine a left-wing magazine like The American Prospect saying that about a liberal black judge? It would never happen.) But if they honestly believe Thomas is one, then they only have themselves to blame for a rotten system that privileges some people over others because of skin pigmentation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From the day his Supreme Court nomination was announced by President George H.W. Bush, Thomas' critics have personally and viciously attacked him as if he were an abstraction -- representing everything they hate about minorities (whether women, gays or blacks) who do not subscribe to their liberal nostrums -- and, in so doing, have sucked him of his humanity as an individual. If liberals want to live up to their self-purported principles of equality and free inquiry, they would do well to stop treating Clarence Thomas as the scapegoat for their political agendas and start treating him like a man.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:David Suter For The Times</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: James Kirchick is on the editorial staff of The New Republic.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398881739.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Incredible Shrinking Kennedy</h2<p>It could have been a far different election season this fall for Maryland's gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Two summers ago, had Al Gore and his advisers stretched their imaginations beyond the hyperbolic \"ground-breaking\" choice of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as running mate, and tapped Mrs. Townsend instead, it's quite possible she'd be vice president today, stumping for Democratic candidates along with President Gore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Lieberman's peak as a candidate in 2000 occurred on the very day he was chosen by Mr. Gore, with the expected mainstream media exultation at the \"daring\" selection of a Jewish man given the nod. Not only was the Connecticut senator overmatched by Dick Cheney in their one debate, but his hollow threats of censoring the entertainment industry, while accepting massive donations from Hollywood moguls, exposed him as a hypocrite.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mrs. Townsend was excluded from Mr. Gore's \"short list\" because of her inexperience -- one-and-a-half terms as Maryland's lieutenant governor and a failed congressional race in 1986 -- and presumably because her state is one of the most reliably Democratic in the nation. However, there's little doubt that her candidacy would not have cost Mr. Gore a single state he eventually won against President Bush. In fact, given her pedigree as Robert F. Kennedy's eldest child, with an extended family campaigning for the ticket, it's likely the team would've won New Hampshire, West Virginia and Florida, and thus the election.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Instead, Mrs. Townsend, never a nimble candidate on her own, is struggling to fend off Republican Rep. Robert Ehrlich in this year's battle to succeed the unpopular Parris Glendening as Maryland's governor. The contest has been mired in a statistical dead heat since mid-summer -- a Mason-Dixon Maryland poll last weekend showed Mrs. Townsend leading Mr. Ehrlich by a 46% to 45% margin -- as Mrs. Townsend has failed to lock up the state's large black electorate, a base of voters that's typically a given for a Democratic candidate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mrs. Townsend's political pitch has been less than perfect. In June she angered Baltimore City's black leaders by choosing retired Navy Admiral Charles Larson, a white former Republican, as her running mate. Mr. Ehrlich, meanwhile, a four-term congressman from Baltimore County, chose a black man, Michael Steele.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In fairness, the current political environment, influenced as it's been by corporate scandals and a backlash against wealthy businessmen, doesn't make the most hospitable turf for a candidate born to privilege. In contrast to Mrs. Townsend, Mr. Ehrlich was reared in the blue-collar Baltimore suburb of Arbutus, where he earned an academic/sports scholarship to Princeton. He then returned to Maryland, spending eight years in the state's House of Delegates before being elected to Congress in 1994.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The juxtapositions of the two candidates have been occasionally startling, and more than occasionally provided good campaign rhetoric for Mr. Ehrlich. Last July, when Mrs. Townsend had a fund-raiser for glittering contributors at her family's mythic Hyannis Port compound, Mr. Ehrlich held a $20 per person crab-and-beer fest in Anne Arundel County. He remarked at the time, \"We're having fun, obviously. The lieutenant governor is home, and I am home.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the polls tightened during the summer, Mrs. Townsend shed her pledge to wage a \"positive\" campaign and hired longtime Kennedy confidante Robert Shrum, the populist millionaire known for slash-and-burn advertising and rhetoric. Four years ago, Mr. Shrum orchestrated an attack against Gov. Glendening's GOP opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, that called her a racist, a charge that even Democrat and then-Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke repudiated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Peter Beinart, editor of the New Republic, wrote in the magazine's Oct. 21 issue that \"Election 2002 does have at least one ennobling characteristic: Race has never mattered less.\" But in Maryland that's not true. In a late-September debate held at the predominantly black Morgan State University and sponsored by the allegedly nonpartisan NAACP, Mrs. Townsend attacked her competitor's opposition to affirmative action. Mr. Ehrlich \"opposes affirmative action based on race,\" she said, \"Well, let me tell you something, slavery was based on race. Lynching was based on race. Discrimination is based on race. Jim Crow was based on race. And affirmative action should be based on race.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One can question Mr. Ehrlich's consent to debate Mrs. Townsend in such a setting -- his family was booed upon entering the auditorium -- but it's not clear that such demagoguery will work. A Democratic consultant in Maryland told me that \"KKT won the debate in the hall, but Ehrlich won it on TV because the performance of the NAACP and the mob in the auditorium turned off many white voters.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Neither is it clear that Mrs. Townsend's caricature of Mr. Ehrlich as a Gingrich-style extremist resonates with voters. While he has voted with the Republican majority in the House 90% of the time, his moderate views on social issues -- qualified support for abortion rights, legalization of marijuana for terminal patients and pro-stem cell research -- hardly squares with her charge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The result of this race might be determined by the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan region, including Maryland's Democratic Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. Mrs. Townsend has aired television advertisements in the past week slamming Mr. Ehrlich for his record on gun control, while on the stump emphasizing her own family's well-known tragedies at the hands of lunatic assassins.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whether this politicization of a hot-button issue invigorates her base supporters or turns off independents who believe she's exploiting the killings could decide the election. Even Maureen Dowd, the liberal New York Times op-ed columnist criticized Mrs. Townsend, writing on Oct. 16: \"Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is trying to capitalize on her personal history with tragic gun killings to save her limp gubernatorial bid.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An even bigger question is whether citizens in Maryland -- especially in areas where the sniper has killed -- will be motivated to vote on Election Day if the assailant isn't apprehended by then. A low turnout is bad news for Mrs. Townsend, and should Mr. Ehrlich prevail, will terminate her future political career.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Smith, a Baltimore resident for 14 years, is editor-in-chief of the New York Press, for which he writes the \"Mugger\" column.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2236765173.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>How to Save Affirmative Action</h2<p>The Clinton Administration's reversal of position on a case that could be one of the most important of the Supreme Court's coming term has disappointed supporters of affirmative action. But given the tenor of the Court's recent decisions on racial preferences, the Administration has made a smart strategic move to preserve what can and should be saved of affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The case concerns the decision of the Piscataway, N.J., school board to promote racial diversity by laying off a white teacher so that it could preserve the job of an equally qualified black teacher. Though the Administration had previously supported the school board, the brief it filed with the Supreme Court on Aug. 23 concedes that the board violated the civil rights of the white teacher.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In previous rulings, the Court has maintained that government use of racial preferences is constitutional only when such action is necessary to remedy a history of overt discrimination, or when the public goal being pursued is ''compelling.'' Moreover, the Court has said, the use of racial preferences must be ''narrowly tailored'' to meet the particular goal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The appellate court that heard the Piscataway case declared, in effect, that racial diversity could never be a compelling state interest. Should the Supreme Court completely uphold the appellate court's ruling, the use of race in decisions about hiring and firing public employees could, for all practical purposes, be prohibited.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the Piscataway case, the avowed goal -- racial diversity within a single, small department of an otherwise diverse faculty -- does not seem ''compelling.'' And the way the school board chose to pursue its goal of diversity -- dismissing a white teacher solely because of her race -- was not ''narrowly tailored.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By acknowledging this, yet at the same time making a broader argument for affirmative action, the Administration hopes to preserve some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring. The approach it has suggested in its brief is essentially a compromise. Even if the Piscataway school board was wrong in this specific instance in its use of racial preference, the Administration argues, there is still a place for affirmative action, and not only to remedy past discrimination. Indeed, as it points out in its brief, there are times when taking race into account is the only way to further compelling public goals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A police department, for example, may need to recruit a diverse officer corps to carry on effective undercover work or to retain public confidence in neighborhoods where there are racial tensions. At schools and colleges, a diverse faculty may, through the example of its own collegiality, teach students important lessons about working across racial lines.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the absolutist opponents of affirmative action have the upper hand, in the courts as well as in the broader public debate. California now outlaws the use of race in public hiring, contracting and education. And in a case challenging affirmative action at the University of Texas Law School, a Federal appeals court ruled last year that racial diversity in a student body could never constitute a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court declined to review that decision, but in taking on the Piscataway case, the Court has the opportunity to clarify the question of when, if ever, it is legitimate to use affirmative action to achieve racial diversity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It would be a grave error for the Court to adopt an absolutist color-blind view on the question of whether race should ever be a factor in decisions about public employment. Moreover, it is impossible to maintain such absolutism and still uphold a commitment to prevent racial discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Consider efforts to recruit job applicants that are directed toward minority candidates -- as when companies send recruiters to heavily black schools when blacks are underrepresented in their work force. Such efforts would clearly violate the color-blind principle. Even when the final hiring decision is made solely on the basis of an applicant's qualifications, without regard to race, these recruitment programs involve discrimination because they bestow the benefits of better job information and a greater number of alternative job offers on some individuals solely because of their race. Yet these programs are widespread in both the public and the private sectors, and they are needed to prevent discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When it comes to public employment, the Administration makes a strong case for considering race. Indeed, its argument could also be applied to the lifetime appointments to the Federal courts that interpret the constitutionality of race-based state action. The legitimacy of court rulings in this area would surely be undermined by the absence from the bench of nonwhite members.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That doesn't mean that racial quotas should be used for judicial appointments. But as far as the Federal judiciary is concerned, there is a compelling public interest in racial diversity for its own sake. Perhaps the Justices who decide the Piscataway case will have the wisdom to see this point.</p>\n"}

The searing news of the disproportionate rates of COVID-19 among Black Americans has added to the urgency of this moment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But not for Donald Trump. His long record of embracing racism as a political tool -- from his promotion of the \"birther\" lie about Barack Obama to his defense of white supremacists -- has made him the most racially polarizing president in the last century.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet while many Republican \"Never Trumpers\" condemn Trump for his brazen appeals to white supremacy, they are curiously silent on Ronald Reagan's record on race and civil rights. It's no accident that the Party of Reagan morphed so easily into the Party of Trump.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Long before Trump descended his golden escalator, promising to \"Make America Great Again,\" Reagan was the first to use the slogan \"Let's Make America Great Again,\" vowing to return America to its past glory before the civil rights movement toppled Jim Crow in the 1960s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whenever the issue of Reagan's hostility to civil rights and unpopularity with Black Americans is broached, conservatives leap to Reagan's defense and stress his apparent lack of personal racism. That view has been shredded by the disclosure last year of a phone call in October 1971 between Richard Nixon and Reagan, in which Reagan described African diplomats as \"monkeys\" who were still \"uncomfortable wearing their shoes.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While Reagan's sunny vision of America as a \"shining city\" may be the antithesis of Donald Trump's dystopian American \"carnage,\" he masterfully deployed racially coded language and other dog whistles like \"states' rights,\" \"law and order\" and \"welfare queens\" that resonated with middle-class taxpayers without appearing racist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One telling illustration is Reagan's decision to give a major speech in his 1980 campaign at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., only miles from where three civil rights workers -- James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner -- were murdered in 1964. Looking back, it is eerily similar to Trump's decision to hold a campaign rally on the day after Juneteenth in Tulsa, Okla., the site of the worst racial massacre in the 20th century.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reagan was the first presidential nominee of a major political party to attend that fair since it started in 1889, and that fact was not lost on the 20,000 white people gathered there on Aug. 3, 1980, many proudly waving Confederate flags and chanting, \"We want Reagan! We want Reagan!\" The crowd was exhilarated with his declaring his fidelity to states' rights, which for a century had been the South's rallying cry to prevent the federal government from interfering with its racial customs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That speech helped Reagan sweep every Southern state except President Carter's home state of Georgia. Since then, the Old Confederacy has been the heart of the GOP. On the eve of Reagan's inauguration, Black Americans feared an assault on the civil rights gains of the 1960s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These fears were well-founded. After all, Reagan began his political career with his 1966 campaign for California governor by denouncing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, while running radio ads referring to urban areas as \"jungles.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Only months after the Watts riots, Reagan made \"law and order\" and opposition to California's far-reaching Fair Housing Act the centerpiece of his campaign to oust the liberal incumbent, Pat Brown.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reagan repeatedly said, \"If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes in the sale or renting of his property, it is his right to do so.\" This stance resonated with millions of middle-class white voters, many of whom had never voted for a Republican, but voted for Reagan in part because they feared African Americans moving into their neighborhoods.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reagan's success in making inroads with white working-class voters in the booming suburbs of Southern California was a template for the \"law and order\" and \"silent majority\" rhetoric that fueled Nixon's presidential victory in 1968. Reagan mounted an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination in 1968, in which he crisscrossed the South and white enclaves across the country thrilling conservative audiences with his scorching attacks on lawless civil rights agitators and his tough talk of law and order. Just hours after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, Reagan called King's assassination \"a great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order and people started choosing which laws they'd break.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1976, Reagan, in challenging Gerald Ford for the Republican presidential nomination, popularized the racist trope of a \"welfare queen,\" repeating at virtually every campaign stop, before white audiences, the fictitious story of a Black welfare cheat, subsidized by hardworking white taxpayers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Overall, Reagan's two-term presidency marked a new nadir in race relations. His administration tried to dilute the Voting Rights Act, vitiated the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and vowed to abolish affirmative action, arguing that white men were the only victims -- of reverse discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reagan's attitudes on civil rights were reflected in his refusal to impose sanctions on the apartheid government of South Africa; he vetoed a 1986 bill imposing sanctions, which Congress overrode. Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu was so incensed that he declared Reagan \"a racist, pure and simple.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most egregiously, Reagan was instrumental in ratcheting up the \"war on drugs,\" which has led to the mass incarceration of Black and poor people of color and the destruction of families and communities. His administration adopted a series of draconian laws that resulted in the imprisonment rate of African Americans on drug charges that is almost six times that of whites, even though whites use illicit drugs at a similar rate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While Reagan eschewed the overt racism of Trump, his racial politics paved the way for Trump. In fact, Reagan's brand of racism was perhaps more sinister than Trump's because he did it with a genial smile. In reckoning with Trump, we need to reckon with Reagan's legacy. And that began with his appeal to white voters in Southern California.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: PHOTO: RONALD REAGAN, at the 1976 GOP National Convention, repeatedly used the trope of the Black \"welfare queen\" to appeal to white voters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTOGRAPHER:David Hume Kennerly Getty Images</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Daniel S.

American academia wears no single ideological facepaint. But in the aggregate, the thinking of the professoriate (and often the earnest studentoriate, too) can self-censor dangerous thoughts. These thoughts include any suggestion that individuals or groups deserve to be critiqued let alone -- heaven forfend! -- criticized. So unless the group in question holds authority, or wealth, or is otherwise by definition oppressive, even honest critiques or criticisms tend to be unwelcome. Judgment can be, you know, so judgmental.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But if your worldview is more impish than that, how best to make fun of the people, the cultural values, that others hold so sacrosanct?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One whispered proposal at Columbia is an \"Affirmative Action Bake Sale,\" at which white or Asian students would be charged markedly more for pastries than Latino or African-American or Native- American customers. The point is to confront the college community with the purported silliness of discriminating -- favorably and unfavorably -- on the basis of race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not irreverent enough for you? How about a rollicking game of \"Catch an Illegal Immigrant\"? Players compete for a bounty by trying to corral a student who dresses up as, say, a Guatemalan border- runner.

{"id": "txt/398482848.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Cut cap gains tax, boost black jobs</h2<p>It's time for the Congressional Black Caucus to support a capital gains tax cut. It may seem counterintuitive to suggest that the Caucus should support the passage of legislation that targets the rich for a tax reduction. But a meaningful capital gains tax cut will help those of us in the black community who are helping to create jobs for middle- and working-class people.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Passage of a capital gains tax cut will stimulate economic growth by freeing up capital for new investments, including venture capital investments in black-controlled companies, thereby creating jobs for the constituents of CBC members. In the long run, policies that increase the availability of investment capital for entrepreneurial endeavors could completely eliminate the need for affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Venture capital, which would receive a big boost from a capital gains tax cut, is a proven method of creating jobs. The most recent study by Venture One Corporation and the National Venture Capital Association found that 495 venture-capital-backed companies generated 75,240 new U.S. jobs between 1989 and 1993. It also found $2 billion of export sales were generated by the same companies. The CBC needs to become a more active and vocal advocate of the black business community in general and the flow of investment capital to black business in particular. As welfare reform increases the pressure on disadvantaged blacks in the inner cities of America, policies that stimulate black business growth are needed to provide opportunities for those coming off the welfare rolls.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the moment, the private equity business, with more than $170 billion under management as of year-end 1994 (according to Private Equity Analyst estimates), flourishes with capital contributions from public pensions funds, corporate pension plans, banks and insurance companies. But very little of that capital has been directed to black firms. It is a national problem that deserves national attention.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Beyond simply cutting capital gains taxes, there are other measures the government can take to help black-owned busineses. Two initiatives come to mind, both of which can be initiated by the administration without additional legislation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, since the Labor Department regulates pension funds and has the responsibility to issue interpretations of regulations, Secretary Robert Reich could issue interpretations of current pension fund policies to encourage them to invest in black-owned businesses. The second initiative should be aimed at getting the brokerage industry to raise money for the black companies. With approximately $1 trillion raised each year by the U.S. brokerage industry for American businesses, it would be good business for the major brokerage firms to tap the capital markets on behalf of black businesses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But none of this is a substitute for a capital gains tax cut. The effect on black-controlled businesses would be to greatly increase the flow of venture capital in the form of equity to such businesses. This decade has seen for the first time genuine interest being expressed by the institutional investment community in making venture capital investments in black businesses. Substantially all black-controlled companies are privately held, and are precisely the type of firms that would benefit from an increased infusion of venture capital from institutions and wealthy individuals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A good indication of the impact that such investments can have on black employment lies in a 1993 Wall Street Journal survey, which found that 60% of all black businesses employ a work force at least 70% black. With a badly needed infusion of equity capital to allow them to expand, black firms would create more jobs for the substantially black constituency base of CBC members.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are other benefits for the CBC in a capital gains tax cut. It would enable the lawmakers to replace the narrowly targeted broadcast properties tax incentive recently struck down by the Republican majority in Congress with a tax incentive that would benefit all industries in which black businesses operate. It would also enable the CBC to form a unique alliance with the Republican Congress to enact legislation that will help all Americans, including black Americans. Such an alliance would position the CBC as a dynamic voting bloc and its members as leaders able to deliver for their constituents by skillfully adapting to the changing political environment. This would most certainly increase the value of the CBC vote.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Granger is president of Ark Capital Management in Chicago. Doris C.

Critics, of whom there are many, call it an overpriced indulgence for the affluent few who do not have to worry about earning a living upon graduation. Fewer and fewer of today's undergraduates are pursuing the liberal arts, with most of them studying practical subjects like finance, marketing, real estate and pharmacy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But James O. Freedman, 67, the retired president of Dartmouth, remains more committed than ever.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''Liberal education opens our eyes to what life is principally about,'' he said. ''It's about understanding yourself and having some resources to deal with everything life throws at you. It's about developing a moral compass and some understanding of how society works, how democracies work.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At home in Cambridge, with his new book, ''Liberal Education and the Public Interest'' (University of Iowa Press, 2003), an ode to the value of liberal education, on the coffee table in front of him, Mr. Freedman makes his case with passion. Contrary to what critics might say, when it comes to getting a job in today's economy, Mr. Freedman says a liberal education is an important advantage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''A liberal education is what teaches people how to write and how to think and makes them much more valuable in the job market over a 40-year career than graduates of a preprofessional program,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''All the employers will tell you that they're seeking the flexibility of mind that a liberal education imbues.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His book came out in January, as he was battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system. The chemotherapy he has been undergoing since September is working.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the fall, with a tumor pressing against the nerves of his lower back, he was using a wheelchair. Now, he needs only a cane to navigate the stairs of the Victorian home he shares with his wife, Sheba.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is Mr. Freedman's fourth bout with cancer since 1994, and just as he writes in his book that a liberal education enables us to see life more clearly, so has he looked clearly at his illness. The odds are that it will return again in a year, he says, and while he hopes to watch his three small grandchildren grow up, he says, there is no way of knowing just how many years he has.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He is focusing, as ever, on writing, and speaking out for the liberal values that he has spent his lifetime working for and that he now sees eroding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''Life is what we are doing now,'' he writes in his book, reflecting upon the importance of an early commitment to the values of liberal arts, equal education, idealism and public service.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On his desk upstairs are a thousand pages of his fourth book: a memoir that moves from his growing up as the son of a high school English teacher in Manchester, N.H., to his undergraduate days at Harvard, where, he says, he was too timid and conventional to be a brilliant student, and on to Yale Law School, where he blossomed intellectually.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The book ends at age 27, when he was a law clerk for Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, one of his heroes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Freedman put his knowledge of the law to use recently, when, as a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, he helped prepare a brief for the United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''The future of America depends on educating minority men and women,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In his 11 years as president of Dartmouth, Mr. Freedman devoted himself to making the college welcoming to what he called the creative loners, cellists, poets and mathematicians, as well as athletes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He also carved out a role as a public intellectual, standing up to a group of right-wing students -- and their prominent, adult benefactors -- who were ridiculing blacks, homosexuals, women and Jews on campus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Making their views known through the neoconservative, off-campus Dartmouth Review, the students ran a front page cartoon that showed Mr. Freedman, who is Jewish, dressed like Adolf Hitler. Eventually, tolerance and civility were restored.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last September, concerned by news reports that Jewish students were being intimidated on campuses amid protests over the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Freedman helped collect signatures from 310 college presidents for a statement calling for ''intimidation-free'' campuses. Some presidents criticized the statement for focusing only on Jewish students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With heavy snow falling on the streets of Cambridge, Mr. Freedman was relaxing in his living room, with Sheba, his wife of nearly 40 years, across from him. They were surrounded by some of Mr. Freedman's 2,000 favorite books, by T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, Saul Bellow, Faulkner, Joyce.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A lifelong book collector, Mr. Freedman reluctantly parted with 4,000 other favorites when he left Dartmouth -- and the library at the president's house -- for Cambridge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Toward evening, the doorbell rang. Howard Gardner, the Harvard educational psychologist who is one of Mr. Freedman's closest friends, came in from the snow.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In retirement, as an elder statesman of academia, Mr. Freedman's advice is sought frequently. Professor Gardner wanted to consult with him about three academics who needed jobs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Freedman is ''the ultimate search engine,'' Professor Gardner said, ''because he knows so many people, in so many ways, heart, mind, spirit.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Life is unpredictable and full of disappointment, Mr. Freedman writes in his book, the breakup of marriages, death of loved ones, enduring illness. In such a world, he writes, ''how ought one to lead a life?''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''That is one of the questions that a liberal education addresses,'' he writes. ''The most effective protection against the contingencies of experience are values that appeal to our very best natures and anchor us most securely in the ocean of fate.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These are the kinds of subjects Dr. Donald Kaufman, one of Mr. Freedman's oncologists, says he enjoys discussing with the former college president.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''I always reserve 30 minutes for his visits,'' Dr. Kaufman said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''They go on for 90. This is for my benefit, not his. He's teaching me what it means to be a patient. He's teaching people how to live.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>James O. Freedman, right, the retired president of Dartmouth, with his friend Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist. Mr. Freedman's new book contends that when it comes to getting a job, a well-rounded education is a major advantage. (C. J. Gunther for The New York Times)</p>\n"}

The Chicano high school and college group was slowly losing its power as more Mexican Americans began to identify as \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\" and wanted no part with radical politics.

And gracias for making the defense of immigrants their rallying cry. From state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra's zeal, to bringing back driver's licenses for the undocumented (which you took away), to declaring us a sanctuary state, it's all a direct response to your cynicism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gracias for inspiring two of the most hilarious death-metal songs ever: \"Matando Gueros\" (\"Killing White People\") and \"Raza Odiada\" (\"Hated Race\"), both by Brujeria. I certainly hope that you take their mock-assassination skit as satire at its finest, instead of a bona fide threat.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gracias for providing the California Republican Party a cautionary tale.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gracias for inadvertently posing for an airplane selfie two years ago with film director Alex Rivera.

It's an experiment providing a \"universal basic income,\" or UBI, to low-income Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In conjunction with the Marin Community Foundation, which plans to contribute $3 million to the effort, the Marin County Board of Supervisors has allocated $400,000 in public funds for the experiment. The program is similar to one recently completed in Stockton, Calif., but one major difference sets the Marin experiment apart: race and sex discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Stockton UBI experiment provided payments to 125 residents of neighborhoods at or below Stockton's median household income. The Marin regime will do the same, but beneficiaries must be \"mothers of color.\" That term is undefined, but it's clear that fathers and white mothers are ineligible to participate. A similar race-based scheme has been announced in Oakland, Calif.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No matter what one thinks of UBI as a policy matter, the use of public funds in the Marin scheme is legally dubious. The California Constitution's equal-protection clause, like the federal one in the 14th Amendment, applies \"strict scrutiny\"\u2014the highest possible level of judicial scrutiny\u2014to racial classifications. California courts, unlike federal ones, also apply strict scrutiny to sex classifications. In Connerly v. State Personnel Board (2001), a California appeals court made that clear in invalidating both race- and sex-based affirmative-action programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If I had grown up in Marin County under its proposed UBI regime, my family would have been ineligible to participate. I grew up poor and at times homeless or living in public housing projects. But my mother, who is white, was raising her three black children on her own.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Marin Community Foundation's chief executive, Thomas Peters, has said that \"this first cohort will focus on low-income moms of color\" because they face \"the greatest aggregate of challenges: low income, young children and facing the daily travails and insults of overt and covert racial discrimination.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My mother was low-income, had three young children and faced racial discrimination. We lived in black communities where black men were stigmatized for consorting with white women, and that stigma flowed to those women and their biracial children.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If my mother was somehow privileged over similarly situated black mothers, it could only have been by the slimmest possible margin. To exclude someone like her from a public-assistance program on account of her skin color is the very definition of racial injustice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Marin UBI scheme threatens to drive the wedge of racial discord currently tearing wildly through our social fabric even deeper. And frankly, policies with good intentions such as UBI, which might conceivably help to address the intractable problem of poverty, will be tainted with the scarlet R of racism and the understandable suspicion of being a pretense for reparative racial justice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Westhill is president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Marin County's Discriminatory 'Universal Basic Income'</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By Devon Westhill</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1716194235.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>UC: free speech vs. hate speech</h2<p>The challenges are enormous, if not insurmountable, as the regents of the University of California seek to develop a hate-speech policy on campuses. Recent anti-Semitic incidents spurred the regents to want to take action, but at their Sept. 17 meeting, they chose not to adopt proposed \"principles against intolerance.\" Instead, they created a committee to consider the issue anew. The reality, however, is that the chance of a breakthrough is low.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Any written policy would need to achieve conflicting goals: expressing a strong commitment to freedom of speech as an integral aspect of education, while seeking to prevent speech that is racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. The trick is in setting the border between heated, even inflammatory, speech and hate speech, which is notoriously difficult.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court long has held that vague speech rules violate the 1st Amendment and deny due process of law. In fact, efforts at defining hate speech by other state universities have been declared unconstitutional on vagueness grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The University of Michigan, for example, adopted a code in the 1980s -- later struck down by the Supreme Court -- that prohibited \"any behavior, verbal or physical, that stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-era veteran status.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But what does it mean to \"stigmatize\" or \"victimize\"? If a professor or student agues that there are inherent differences between men and women, does that violate the policy? Can advocacy of affirmative action be deemed to violate this policy because it stigmatizes racial minorities by assuming that they need preferential treatment to compete?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Along with principles of intolerance, activists on UC campuses are urging the Board of Regents to adopt the State Department definition of anti-Semitism, which includes trying to \"demonize Israel,\" \"delegitimize Israel\" or applying a \"double-standard to Israel.\" But who is fit to judge when criticism of Israel's policies and actions veers into demonization? If a student states that Palestinians should have a right of return, is she seeking to delegitimize Israel or just airing a controversial opinion? What if she says the country's founding was a mistake?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Under the 1st Amendment, there is no such thing as a false idea and all viewpoints may be expressed. The 1st Amendment even protects the right to deny the Holocaust or advocate the subjugation of a supposedly inferior group. There unquestionably is a 1st Amendment right to argue against (or for) the existence of Israel or to contend that it should meet (or not have to meet) higher standards of human rights than other nations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These difficulties have led some campuses to take a softer approach: adopting community speech guidelines or principles, while pledging not to punish those who violate those principles. Campus administrators can feel that they are taking positive actions without fearing constitutional challenges. Also, they can remind students that just because there is a 1st Amendment right to say something, that doesn't mean it should be said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But such middleground policies always seem to leave everyone dissatisfied. Those who want to prevent hate speech see them as toothless or ineffectual because they cannot be enforced. Those who are most concerned about protecting freedom of expression on campus still worry that they will chill speech and inhibit discussion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Is there a solution to all of this? Is there anything the regents committee and other universities can try?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My advice would be to draft a policy that focuses on reaffirming the importance of free expression while defining what is not constitutionally protected. There is no 1st Amendment right to threaten or harass another person or to deface someone else's property.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The policy should not seek to inhibit or limit protected speech, no matter how offensive it might be. The policy should seek to define, with as much precision as possible, what types of speech and conduct cross the line and are impermissible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We should also remember that universities have the right to free speech too, and can and should speak out against inflammatory speech that targets members of the university community. This, of course, is consistent with the educational mission of universities and a basic principle of the 1st Amendment: the best remedy for the speech we dislike is more speech.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Erwin Chemerinsky is the dean of the UC Irvine School of Law.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/421591042.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Commentary; SAT's 'Halo Effect' Casts a Long Shadow</h2<p>The discussion emanating from the University of California regarding the SAT is an invigorating move for American higher education. It is long overdue. The SAT is ideally viewed as a yardstick of merit. It has been used for decades as a key criterion for admission to four-year colleges and universities. Yet, in reality, the SAT is a poorly defined test that reflects racial and economic privileges. It reproduces sex, race and class inequalities in access to the nation's educational resources that produce wealth and power.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The SAT affords a too-easy sorting of students' applications into the categories of admit, maybe admit and don't admit. The problem is that many of the students in the don't-admit category could succeed with flying colors if they were given the chance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The SAT creates a halo effect that colors the more holistic evaluation of applicants' statements of purpose and letters of recommendation. It creates a mind-set that is tough to overcome for students who don't have the \"test-wiseness\" to correctly fill the bubbles on questions that involve obscure vocabulary or reasoning that is embedded in white cultural trivia. Students might be expected to know Shakespeare or Voltaire, but they are safe if they are ignorant of Wheatley or Nkrumah. After more than 20 years of college teaching, I've learned that the single most important criterion for a student's success is his or her motivation and effort, attributes that are untapped by SAT scores.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I've seen students with abysmal scores excel and students with stellar ones flounder. For millions of aspiring college students, the SAT tests students on material that they have not been taught. In the context of known racial inequalities in educational opportunity, the use of an inflexible yardstick such as the SAT is inherently racist. Ward Connerly, the regent who has led the movement to abolish affirmative action at UC and in the nation, suggested that he would not want the banning of the SAT to be a \"proxy\" for racial preferences. But the use of the SAT is, in fact, a proxy for maintaining the racial and economic advantages of rich whites.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>UC President Richard H. Atkinson is correct in casting doubt on the SAT, but he is wrong in suggesting that the SAT II, a subject- matter test, is an improvement. Students are advised to take the verbal and math sections of the SAT II (and a subject area of their choosing), which re-create the same biases as the SAT I. Standardized tests cannot assess merit in the context of non- standardized educational experiences. This is also true for the tests that act as gatekeepers to the professions, the MCAT (for medicine), the LSAT (for law) and the GRE (for the social sciences and humanities).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The under-representation of minorities who face discrimination in undergraduate programs dramatically worsens in graduate schools. Much is at stake in Atkinson's proposal because of the multibillion- dollar nature of the testing and test-preparation industries. Students waste valuable time and money in preparing for exams that are irrelevant to their success or failure in higher education. Students take the tests several times in hopes of improving their scores--a cost that is prohibitive to families that do not have financial resources.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>SAT scores are weak predictors of first-year college success, explaining only 10% of the variance in grades, and have virtually no bearing on subsequent success or failure. Other measures of presumed merit, such as grade-point averages, are also problematic. GPAs are inflated by advanced placement courses that may produce GPAs above 4.0. We know that students in predominantly African American and Latino schools have less access to these courses, just as they have less access to books and experienced teachers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a perverse irony, African American and Latino communities support public institutions that they do not benefit from in proportion to their tax dollars. Admissions procedures must eschew criteria that have known biases and incorporate those that allow students' drive and determination to manifest themselves. They should emphasize the more important qualities of critical thinking, intercultural awareness and a healthy skepticism of the so-called knowledge items contained in the SAT.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Instead of spending billions of dollars to exclude students, we should redirect those dollars to create more seats in more universities. At Pitzer College, students, faculty and staff have been engaged in an ongoing dialogue about the merits of the SAT. In a recent opinion study on the matter, the college's constituencies have been nearly evenly divided. Atkinson's bold proposal nudges us in the right direction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Halford H.

{"id": "txt/1987023512.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Heartbeat of Racism Is Denial</h2<p>When our reality is too ugly, we deny reality. It is too painful to look at. Reality is too hard to accept.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mental health experts routinely say that denial is among the most common defense mechanisms. Denial is how the person defends his superior sense of self, her racially unequal society.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Denial is how America defends itself as superior to \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa and elsewhere, as President Trump reportedly described them in a White House meeting last week, although he has since, well, denied that. It\u2019s also how America defends itself as superior to those \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d in Africa, to quote how liberal opponents of Mr. Trump might often describe them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Trump appears to be unifying America \u2014 unifying Americans in their denial. The more racist Mr. Trump sounds, the more Trump country denies his racism, and the more his opponents look away from their own racism to brand Trump country as racist. Through it all, America remains a unified country of denial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The reckoning of Mr. Trump\u2019s racism must become the reckoning of American racism. Because the American creed of denial \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not a racist\u201d \u2014 knows no political parties, no ideologies, no colors, no regions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On Friday, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, affirmed that Mr. Trump did use the term \u201cshithole\u201d during a White House meeting on immigration with lawmakers. Mr. Durbin rightfully described Mr. Trump\u2019s words as \u201chate-filled, vile and racist,\u201d and added, \u201cI cannot believe that in the history of the White House in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But Mr. Trump is no exception. In framing Mr. Trump\u2019s racism as exceptional, in seeking to highlight the depth of the president\u2019s cruelty, Mr. Durbin, a reliably liberal senator, showed the depth of denial of American racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Begin with the eight presidents who held slaves while in the Oval Office. Then consider how Abraham Lincoln urged black people to leave the United States. \u201cEven when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race,\u201d Lincoln told five black guests at the White House in 1862. So \u201cit is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Raging then as we are raging now, the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison responded, \u201cCan anything be more puerile, absurd, illogical, impertinent, untimely?\u201d He added that \u201chad it not been for the cupidity of their white enslavers, not one of their race would now be found upon this continent.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Presidential history also includes the social Darwinism of Theodore Roosevelt, the federal-government-segregating, \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d-praising Woodrow Wilson \u2014 and the bigotry that came from the mouths of presidents who are generally seen as essential to racial progress. President Lyndon B. Johnson said \u201cnigger\u201d nearly as often as Ku Klux Klansmen did.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism. Where there is suffering from racist policies, there are denials that those policies are racist. The beat of denial sounds the same across time and space.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I grew up to the beat of racist denial in Queens, not far from where Mr. Trump grew up. I was raised in the urban \u201chell\u201d of neighborhoods he probably avoided, alongside immigrants from countries he derided last week. In school or elsewhere, we all heard recitals of the American ideal of equality, especially on the day we celebrate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Those events often feature recitals of the words \u201call men are created equal,\u201d which were written by a slaveholder who once declared that black people \u201care inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thomas Jefferson was not a founding father of equality. He was a founding father of the heartbeat of denial that lives through both Mr. Trump\u2019s denials and the assertion that his racial views are abnormal for America and its presidents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fifty years ago, Richard Nixon transformed this historic heartbeat of denial into an intoxicating political philosophy. His presidential candidacy appealed to George Wallace-type segregationists while also attracting Americans who refused to live near \u201cdangerous\u201d black residents, obstructed the desegregation of schools, resisted affirmative action policies, framed black mothers on welfare as undeserving, called the black family pathological and denigrated black culture \u2014 all those racists who refused to believe they were racist in 1968.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nixon designed his campaign, one of his advisers explained, to allow a potential supporter to \u201cavoid admitting to himself that he was attracted by\u201d the \u201cracist appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A new vocabulary emerged, allowing users to evade admissions of racism. It still holds fast after all these years. The vocabulary list includes these: law and order. War on drugs. Model minority. Reverse discrimination. Race-neutral. Welfare queen. Handout. Tough on crime. Personal responsibility. Black-on-black crime. Achievement gap. No excuses. Race card. Colorblind. Post-racial. Illegal immigrant. Obamacare. War on Cops. Blue Lives Matter. All Lives Matter. Entitlements. Voter fraud. Economic anxiety.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The denials using these phrases come from both conservatives and white liberals who think people of color are stuck in cycles of unstable families and criminal cultures, and that the deprivations of poverty and discrimination spin out bad people.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Trump opened his candidacy with racism, calling Mexicans criminals and rapists. Since taking office, he has looked away from the disaster zone in Puerto Rico, he has called some violent white supremacists \u201cvery fine people,\u201d and he has described Nigerians as living in \u201chuts .\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When someone identifies the obvious, Mr. Trump resounds the beat of denial as he did before he was president: \u201cI\u2019m the least racist person that you\u2019ve ever met ,\u201d that \u201cyou\u2019ve ever seen ,\u201d that \u201cyou\u2019ve ever encountered .\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These are ugly denials. But it\u2019s the denials from those who stand in strong opposition to this president that are more frustrating to me: denials that their attacks on identity politics are racist. Denials that the paltry number of people of color in elite spaces marks racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those denials echo the same ones that frustrated Dr. King in 1963 as he sat in a Birmingham jail cell and wrote , \u201cShallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Trump, I suspect, will go to his grave with his heart beating in denial of the ill will of racism. Many others will as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because we naturally want to look away from our ugliness. We paint over racist reality to make a beautiful delusion of self, of society. We defend this beautiful self and society from our racist reality with the weapons of denial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Denial is fueled by the stigma associated with being a racist. Feeding the stigma is how \u201cracist\u201d is considered almost like an identity, a brand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But a racist is not who a person is. A racist is what a person is, what a person is saying, what a person is doing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Racist is not a fixed category like \u201cnot racist,\u201d which is steeped denial. Only racists say they are not racist. Only the racist lives by the heartbeat of denial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The antiracist lives by the opposite heartbeat, one that rarely and irregularly sounds in America \u2014 the heartbeat of confession.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/opinion/sunday/heartbeat-of-racism-denial.html?partner=bloomberg</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: IBRAM X.

{"id": "txt/418239486.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>HOW CHURCHES CAN HEAL OUR RACIAL DIVIDE</h2<p>Just as it took President Richard Nixon to open the door to China, will it take the Christian Coalition's Ralph Reed to open the door between white conservatives and the African-American masses?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some will find the idea laughable. As executive director of the Rev. Pat Robertson's very big, influential and conservative Christian Coalition, Reed has vigorously opposed mainstream civil rights leaders on such key issues as affirmative action and welfare reform.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But, the idea of Beijing hosting the notoriously Red-baiting Nixon sounded laughable, too, until it happened. At least Reed has a shorter leap to make than Nixon did.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reed has long called on white, Christian conservatives to make amends for centuries they spent on the wrong side of black liberation. In his 1994 book, \"Politically Incorrect: The Emerging Faith Factor in American Politics,\" he wrote that historical cooperation with slavery and segregation \"undermined the moral authority of religious conservatives as they have sought to redress other forms of social injustice--abortion, euthanasia, religious bigotry--in recent times.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To plug the gap, the coalition has announced Samaritan Project, a multiracial program to rejuvenate low-income, inner-city neighborhoods.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Headed by an African-American, the Rev. Earl Jackson, the coalition's national liaison for community development, the Samaritan Project offers compassionate conservatives a chance to put their money where their mouths are.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among other ideas, it proposes a new multiracial partnership to revitalize local churches and rejuvenate the national debate on racial justice. It commits the coalition's members and its network of 125,000 churches to raise funds for partnerships with 1,000 inner-city churches by 2000, particularly for those churches which are helping at-risk youths.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On racial justice, the coalition plans a May conference in Baltimore to which black and white church leaders from across the nation are invited to hammer out an agenda for cooperation \"across racial and cultural lines.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a conference call with me and six other newspaper columnists last week, Reed and Jackson said the project was inspired by the organization's successful call for white churches to help rebuild black churches destroyed in last year's wave of church burnings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So far, Reed and Jackson said, they have raised $850,000 and given away most of it in grants averaging $20,000 per church to 40 congregations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"African-American leaders were far more receptive than I ever thought possible,\" Reed said. \"I never asked people whether they were Democratic or Republican or liberal or conservative. It has changed us. God took a tragedy and turned it into something good.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The help could hardly go to a better place. The black church has been the African-American community's most durable and liberating institution through times much tougher than these. Black church leaders were the core of the abolitionist movement, the civil rights movement and countless independent, self-help neighborhood housing and social service programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, their successes usually wind up on the back pages of local newspapers, if at all, making a very small blip on the media's or the public's radar screens.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Christian Coalition can bring the communications network that can help black churches feel less isolated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It can also bring about public attention that can help change society's prevailing cynicism about the ability of poor people to help themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Publicity does have its virtues. Assignment editors who yawn at the efforts of a little church here or there suddenly perk up when Ralph Reed holds a press conference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the less noble side, there is no question that conservatives hope the Samaritan Project will improve not only their moral authority but also their political clout. In return, the coalition hopes it can win black support for an array of ideas liberal leaders tend to oppose: school vouchers, a tax credit (not just a deduction) for charitable donations, tax breaks to encourage business investments in depressed areas and vouchers for schools and drug rehabilitation programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Each of these ideas is currently being proposed in various forms in the House by Oklahoma's J.C. Watts, Congress' only black Republican, and in the Senate by Republican Daniel Coats of Indiana.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So be it. Black church leaders will have to decide for themselves whether the Samaritan Project is manna from Heaven or a Trojan horse. In the meantime, I am delighted, after years of racially polarized national politics, to see conservatives compete with liberals for black support. It's also refreshing to see churches take the lead again for racial reconciliation. We can use a few miracles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustrtion by David Csicsko.</p>\n"}

Keep that in mind as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It seems like an easy case. How could a federal statute designed to end the historic suppression of African American voting not be constitutional? The 15th Amendment gives voters of all races equal rights and expressly grants Congress the power to enforce those rights -- which Congress exercised by reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act (VRA) for 25 years in 2006.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The vote was 98 to 0 in the Senate and 390 to 33 in the House; a conservative Republican president from Texas, George W.

Moderates get squeezed out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Voting Rights Act is one reason House debates so often pit upstart tea party Republicans from Southern suburbs against veteran African American Democrats from Southern cities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Civil rights organizations defend the legislation's current incarnation as if the risks to minority enfranchisement were unchanged since 1965. This is understandable. Much as affirmative action in universities helped build a middle class after segregation, \"opportunity districts\" for minority candidates helped create a cadre of black elected officials. The act's pre-clearance showed continuing relevance as a check on potentially discriminatory voter ID laws in Texas and South Carolina.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, the law too often produces anomalies such as the 2003 case Georgia v. Ashcroft, in which civil rights organizations sided with a Republican Justice Department against a state redistricting plan on the grounds that it did not create enough majority-minority districts -- even though Georgia's African America Democratic officeholders overwhelmingly supported the plan because they wanted to spread black votes, and influence, more widely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For the most part, minority voters no longer face the kind of blunt denial of voting rights that gave rise to the 1965 act; in 2012, blacks voted at a higher rate than whites, according to a Pew Research center analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In such a world, the corrosive political effects of racial gerrymandering under the VRA loom larger -- even compared with the benefits to minority candidates. The creation of safe minority districts put a floor under the number of blacks elected but also, arguably, a ceiling over how high they can rise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the South, the message and ideology that win in a majority-minority district rarely work at the (majority-white) statewide level.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Congress didn't really tackle such issues when it extended the Voting Rights Act in 2006. Small wonder: Incumbents of both parties and all races owe their positions to the current system. A shake-up of the status quo might have exposed them, and then-President Bush, to election-year charges of racial insensitivity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fact is, by 2006 the Supreme Court had expressed concerns about the real-world consequences of the Voting Rights Act in several cases,and it has again since then.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It should surprise no one if the Roberts Court invokes precedent requiring that federal impositions on the states be \"congruent and proportional\" to the civil rights violations they remedy, and it strikes down, or guts, pre-clearance -- holding that rules based on mid-1960s political realities are simply out of sync with the 21st century.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That would be a pretty activist ruling. But it might just start a healthy debate about how we can protect voting rights while restoring the nation's political center.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>lanec@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/432415722.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Fixing the Race Gap in 25 Years or Less</h2<p>THE Supreme Court decision upholding affirmative action in university admissions seemed to carry an expiration date. ''We expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her 5-to-4 majority opinion last week.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While the justices have in the past said that affirmative action should not be used forever, never before has a justice placed a specific time limit on it. Having now done so, Justice O'Connor has raised tough questions, both broad and specific.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Are her views merely idle musings, or will they become an iron-clad legal principle? Should the goal be parity in graduation rates of white, black and Hispanic high school students? Or should it be equality in financing between poor school districts, which tend to have more minority students, and middle-class white ones? Can the gap between black and white students on the SAT be bridged in the next generation?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In The Chicago Tribune, Justice O'Connor said in a rare interview that the country can tackle many of these challenges. ''I hope it looks as though we don't need artificial help to fill our classrooms with highly qualified students at the graduate level,'' she said. ''And if we do our job on educating young people, we can reach that goal.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But closing the disparities in educational achievement and opportunities for college applicants across racial and ethnic lines will involve vociferous debate over the relative importance of school financing, social inequality and student study habits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Statistics tell the story. On every major indicator of academic success -- the SAT, the A.C.T. and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (given to elementary and secondary students) -- the gap between white and minority students has persisted for decades. Though it narrowed somewhat on the national assessment exams from the 1980's through the early 90's, the divide has only widened since then.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''There is some serious heavy lifting to do before we get to the dream scenario Justice O'Connor is envisioning,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and an assistant secretary of education in the Reagan administration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some liberals say the gap can be closed only by equalizing the amount of money spent on educating whites and minorities. The school districts that many blacks and Hispanics attend spend $902 less per student on average than mostly white districts, according to a national study conducted last year by the Education Trust, a group focused on closing the achievement gap.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To some degree, federal and state governments can, and do, try to fix this imbalance by sending more money to schools serving poor -- and, by extension, disproportionately minority -- students. Federal assistance for poor students is increasing, and state governments gave an average of $27 more per pupil to disproportionately minority schools in 2000 than to predominately white schools, though that hardly had a perceptible impact on the financing gap.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But even if federal and state lawmakers were bent on eliminating the financial discrepancies between white and minority districts, they couldn't have much affect. On average, states and the federal government have never accounted for more than 56 percent of schools' revenues over the last decade or so; the remainder has come from local sources, mostly property taxes. This financial structure makes parity unlikely at best.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And conservatives argue that the focus on financial parity misses the point, and point to some minority-dominated city school districts that have high spending per student but still lag well behind less flush districts, particularly in rural areas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moreover, educational parity may be linked to bigger, more complex economic factors. Most beneficiaries of affirmative action are middle-income. According to a study by Anthony Carnevale, vice president of the Educational Testing Service, 74 percent of students at the 146 most prestigious colleges and universities -- where competition for admissions is most intense and where affirmative action is practiced -- come from families in the top 25 percent of the nation's socioeconomic scale (as measured by income, educational attainment and occupations of the parents). Only 3 percent of the students at these highly selective schools come from the bottom 25 percent of the socioeconomic scale. As Lani Guinier, a law professor at Harvard University, puts it, ''affirmative action is less an escalator up than it is a bridge across.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But even middle-class black and Hispanic children who are burdened with issues of crime, troubled homes and poor schools have not been able to close the test-score gap with their white counterparts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''The gap persists across all income levels,'' said Freeman Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, who has written extensively on improving the academic achievement of black students. ''We're talking about generations of habits in too many homes,'' said Mr. Hrabowski, who is black. ''Unfortunately, reading is not the No. 1 priority as a habit. There is much more emphasis on television watching.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Both sides on the affirmative action issue agree on the need to close the education gap, but not much else. Some supporters of affirmative action hope that Justice O'Connor's 25-year time frame will protect affirmative action while the country makes headway in closing that rift.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the decision last week does not invalidate laws in California and Washington State that ban the use of race in public university admissions, hiring and government contracting. Ward Connerly, the black California businessman who was the force behind passing those laws, has already vowed to make Michigan his next target.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Demographic pressures will also come into play. The Educational Testing Service estimates that from 1995 to 2015, the percentage of whites on college campuses will decline from 71 percent to 63 percent, while Hispanics will increase to 15 percent, from the current 11 percent, with blacks holding steady at 13 percent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But with minorities making up a larger proportion of students going to college -- and with the children of young immigrants approaching college age toward the end of Justice O'Connor's 25-year target -- Hispanic and black parents may be clamoring even more forcefully that their children not be shut out of top schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the end, the debate has not changed. Opponents of affirmative action will continue to say that such programs keep the country from focusing on what needs to be done -- namely, helping minority students meet higher standards. The supporters of race preferences counter that the country cannot end affirmative action without first fixing the education system. All agree that unless a commitment is made -- by society and minority families themselves -- the old arguments will still be around in 25 years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lisa Navarette, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said, ''If all we do over the 25 years is affirmative action, then we will still need affirmative action.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Diversity, 1964: The University of Michigan Law School yearbook reflects the times.

{"id": "txt/420294538.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>'Indispensable' ; Johnson advised that the secret to success was to make yourself indispensable. He did and he was.</h2<p>I don't remember everything that John H. Johnson, the pioneer black publisher, said when he was honored by the National Association of Black Journalists in 1987. But I probably will never forget his three words of advice:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Make yourself indispensable.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's hard to find three better words that sum up the successful business philosophy of John Harold Johnson, who died Monday at age 87.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To black Americans of my generation, Johnson's publications Ebony, Jet and Negro Digest were indispensable reading matter, offering a brighter and more prosperous vision of black America than most of the mainstream--also known as \"white-owned\"--media provided.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To advertisers, Johnson's pioneering publications broke through the myth that the black consumer market was not worth targeting through black-owned media.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today the newsstands are filled with magazines niche-marketed to blacks or Hispanics, but that really began with Johnson back in the 1940s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And to journalists, particularly black journalists, Johnson's publications provided employment, a training ground and a model for how people of color might be covered in a more complete fashion than simply crime, sports or show business stories.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His 1989 autobiography \"Succeeding Against the Odds\" reads almost like a business-school series of case studies in how to solve whatever problems life throws at you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When Arkansas refused to educate black children in his area past the 8th grade, his mother, Gertrude Johnson Williams, a cook and domestic worker, saved for two years to move her family to Chicago in the 1930s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Young Johnnie was working days at a black-owned life insurance company and studying at night at Northwestern University when he started up Negro Digest in 1942 with $500 that his mother raised by borrowing against the family furniture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When its circulation stalled at 50,000 a few months later, he persisted in requesting a guest column from Eleanor Roosevelt until she agreed, immediately boosting circulation to 100,000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1945, Johnson launched Ebony, a picture magazine for blacks. Its initial press run of 25,000 copies was completely sold out. Pocket-size Jet magazine began in 1951. Jet helped launch the modern civil rights movement in 1955 when it published open-casket funeral photos of the mangled body of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Chicagoan who was savagely murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Despite its annual special editions focusing thoughtfully on major issues of black politics and economics, we black journalists, among others, often ridiculed the sugar-coated emphasis that Ebony and Jet put on the upwardly ambitious black middle class. Yet we also understood Johnson's reluctance to focus on negative news about black life, since there was so much of that in the mainstream media.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The bourgeois flavor of Johnson's publications was a minor criticism in the life of a man who overcame tremendous hardships to fill an important vacuum in black life and become one of America's wealthiest businessmen.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that in mind, his \"make yourself indispensable\" speech had special resonance. Speaking to his audience of predominately young and aspiring print and broadcast journalists, he offered us the example of Matthew Henson, the black man who helped Adm. Robert Peary reach the North Pole.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Henson was not hired under any affirmative action plan or out of the goodness of Peary's heart, Johnson pointed out. Henson was hired because he had taken the time to learn the language of the Inuit people, who were indispensable to their journey.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What Johnson did not mention was the equally fascinating story of how he gave an autographed copy of Henson's autobiography to Zenith Electronics Corp. chief executive officer Eugene McDonald, after hearing that McDonald was a fan of arctic explorers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>McDonald was impressed enough by the gift and by a four-page Ebony feature on Henson that Zenith became Ebony's first major corporate advertiser in the 1950s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He helped persuade other major corporate advertisers to follow, a major breakthrough at the time for black-oriented media. Two decades later, Johnson was elected to Zenith's board of directors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Johnson's career was full of stories like that. His life presents case studies in leadership, which is, above all, the art of problem solving. While others might fret, moan or whine, he was a get-it- done kind of guy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He understood that no one, black or otherwise, would patronize your business purely out of racial loyalty. Consumers in a free market want value, service and quality. He set a high standard for all three. Despite the changing times that his publications helped to bring about, he found ways to stay indispensable.

Many people I interact with outside my job don\u2019t even know that I am a professor, or that I have a doctoral degree. When I introduce myself in public, I\u2019m Carlotta Berry.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But when I introduce myself in the classroom, I\u2019m Dr. Berry. And I insist on being Dr. Berry.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Titles in the academy are inconsistent at best. I have colleagues who would prefer to be called by their first name, or nicknames like \u201cBone Saw.\u201d But they are mostly men, and almost all white, and they have that luxury. As an African-American woman in a mostly Caucasian- and male-dominated field, I don\u2019t.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some find my insistence on this formality a bit pretentious or arrogant. But they don\u2019t understand my story, and that of many other women and people of color in the academy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Having worked with thousands of students, I know for a fact that for many \u2014 though by no means all, or even most \u2014 there is already a presumption that I, as a female and African-American, am less qualified than my white male colleagues, or at the very least that I was hired in order to meet a double minority quota. And I get it \u2014 anti-affirmative-action ideologues have managed to not only demolish the legitimacy of that policy, but tar the reputation of anyone who might have benefited from it (even if, like me, they did not).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How do I know? Sometimes it\u2019s just a sense, a feeling I get from people\u2019s tone of voice. But some students will automatically call me Ms., while naturally referring to my male counterparts as Doctor or Professor. I\u2019m not alone: When I meet fellow female engineering professors at conferences, this sort of treatment is always a topic of conversation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In class, I have my derivations questioned, lectures critiqued, grading regarded as too harsh or unfair and my expectations dismissed as too high or difficult. I once had a student who would review notes with me that he had taken on my lecture, then offer tips on how I could improve. It seems he thought he was doing me a favor, despite the fact that I had been teaching for six years by then. I doubt that this is an experience that many of my male colleagues have ever had to endure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On other occasions, I have had students state that it is difficult to follow my lectures because of my dialect or slang (neither of which I have, or use).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So what can I do? I already have to run faster and jump higher just to gain that minimal level of respect that my colleagues are graciously, automatically afforded. But I can also insist that my students interact with me in a professional manner, even if it\u2019s not something they\u2019re accustomed to in other classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I tell friends outside the academy about these challenges, they\u2019re often surprised. It\u2019s 2014, and this is higher education, where enlightened worldviews are supposed to dominate. But consider that according to data from the American Society for Engineering Education, as of 2011 African-American women made up 4 percent of all women in the engineering professoriate. Between 2001 and 2012, the number of African-American engineering faculty members increased to 3 percent from 2 percent. In all, in 2012 there were only 140 African-American women working as engineering professors \u2014 out of some 24,640 across the entire field (not including computer engineering).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For me, this statistical desert is made even more stark by the fact that, at a private school in a Midwestern town like mine, students may have interacted with African-Americans only in the service industry, or in high school, with female teachers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I decided to become an engineering professor 20 years ago while sitting in class and realizing that I had never had a professor who looked like me, acted like me or even seemed interested in me. I was typically one of only two or three female students, and one of only one or two African-American students. I wanted to change the face of engineering by showing that the profession could be cool, interesting, exciting, engaging and, most important, diverse. In that way, insisting that students use my title isn\u2019t just about me \u2014 it\u2019s about broadcasting, to any female and black students who might hear it, that I am black, a woman, and an engineer, and that they can be the same.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I enter my classroom today, I am still one of only two or three women in my department (depending on how you count the faculty), and I am one of only one or two African-Americans. Still, I hope that someday, when an African-American woman walks into an engineering classroom, the students recognize that the professor has arrived, and that she won\u2019t have to insist on their calling her Doctor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.</p>\n"}

He is telling us that were he not such an empathetic and benevolent president, African Americans would be far worse off. He suggests that no other president has shown such generosity to a group of people as helpless as we are.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I now know the cause of my indignation. Trump sounds like a slave master proclaiming that he is good to his Negroes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To keep their slaves submissive, the masters would threaten to sell them to less compassionate owners if they got out of line. \"I have done more for the Black community\" sounds like a slave owner claiming that he's a good master because he doesn't beat his slaves as often or cut off their feet to stop them from fleeing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is a racist, self-gratifying pronouncement that was passed down through generations of prominent white people who held power over African Americans. It was prevalent in the South during the 1960s, when Black women largely were domestic workers cleaning homes and caring for the children of white employers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was not uncommon for a white woman to brag to her friends about how good she was to her help. Though she paid wages too small to live on, she rewarded her \"girl\" with items from her home -- discarded furniture, clothing and trinkets that Black people struggling to put food on the table would never buy for themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Trump wants us to understand that even the first Black president, Barack Obama, couldn't fix our problems. Only someone like him -- white with an abundance of intellect -- could lead us to the Promised Land. But there's only so much he can do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Trump's comments reflect the racist, stereotypical attitude he and others in his circle espouse about the Black community. He sees African Americans as violently barbaric people and describes our neighborhoods as \"living in hell.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He has written us off as too dumb to understand how we have created these conditions ourselves. And he is losing patience with us because we refuse to acknowledge all that he does for us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, expressed it more bluntly. Appearing Monday on \"Fox & Friends,\" Kushner brought up the old racist adage that Black people can't succeed to the heights of white people because they don't want to be successful.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"One thing we've seen in a lot of the Black community, which is mostly Democrat, is that President Trump's policies are the policies that can help people break out of the problems that they're complaining about,\" said Kushner, a top White House adviser. \"But he can't want them to be successful more than they want to be successful.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kushner went on to suggest that African Americans would rather complain than do what is necessary to improve their lives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In other words, the white savior in the Oval Office has broken his back trying to help Black people, while we are being lazy and shiftless. This came from someone who came up in his father's business and is only in his prominent position because he is married to the president's daughter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The hypocrisy of both Kushner and Trump, who inherited wealth from his father, is astounding. It shows complete ignorance when it comes to the interplay between race and economics in America.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It overlooks the impressive achievements of large numbers of African Americans in spite of a system that historically has offered little or no assistance. It also ignores that this same system has successfully fought to tear down equalizers such as affirmative action that sought to provide a bridge to economic parity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Speaking at Stanford University in 2017, Harvard University sociologist William Julius Wilson pointed out that the income of more affluent African Americans was increasing prior to Trump taking office.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When adjusted for inflation, the percentage of African Americans earning at least $75,000 more than doubled to 21% from 1970 to 2014, he said. Those making $100,000 or more nearly quadrupled to 13%. In contrast, white Americans saw a less impressive increase, from 11 to 26%, he added.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By no means does that indicate that African Americans have reached economic parity in this county. In fact, we remain far from it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But it does prove that Trump is not the savior to Black people he claims to be.

About 1,000 people filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't have done it without him. ''We are here tonight to reject any notion that one race is superior to another,'' Calvary's pastor, the Rev. Jerry Carter, said to cheers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The service and a candlelight march to the Morristown Green were arranged at the urging of the mayor, John J. DeLaney Jr., who was looking for a way to counter Mr. Barrett without giving him the satisfaction of a confrontation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The town has about 17,000 residents --  about 15 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic -- and just around the corner from Calvary church is evidence that all is not harmonious. Outside a house, a sign commemorates the death of a black resident who was killed last year by the police in a neighboring town. Prosecutors cleared the officers, but, for some, his death remains an example of racial profiling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>MONDAY night, though, was a display of racial accord. Rabbi David Nesson of Morristown's Jewish Community Center reminded the crowd that Washington once wrote to a synagogue in Newport, R.I., that one of the country's guiding ideals was ''to give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Jakki Dumas-Footman, 33, a financial analyst, said she felt compelled to come to the service with her daughter even though she grew up black in a largely white Morristown neighborhood and rarely felt racism. ''I've never seen a K.K.K. march,'' she said. ''I brought my daughter. She knows about the K.K.K. I want her to see it. This is our history, in a way.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nate Moore, a 58-year-old computer consultant, came Monday night remembering that history from having grown up black in Alabama. Mr. Barrett's message ''really astounded me,'' he said. ''I really thought these days were passed.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The songs of equality at the church recalled the old days, Mr. Moore said, but there were more white faces in the pews,  and the ranks of racists were thinner. ''I think you have to accept the differences and move on,'' he said. ''I think that's what we're doing more of -- accepting the differences and moving on.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But moving on is not a straight course.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Monday night's harmony gave way to yesterday's ugliness. Mr. Barrett's sad parade of eight followers was separated from an angry crowd of about 250 by barricades and helmeted police on horses. At the height of the event, protesters from groups including the Progressive Labor Party were hurling vile taunts at the police as some protesters knocked down barricades and threw golf balls and batteries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Asa Watkins, an 83-year-old artist from Morristown, had come to oppose Mr. Barrett, but was taken aback by the anger on both sides.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Watkins was reminded that Washington had spent two treacherous winters in Morristown on the way to victory. This Fourth of July freedom had another tough, but victorious, round in Morristown. ''It's a messy process, democracy is,'' said Mr. Watkins, leaving the rally. ''It always is.''</p>\n"}

It reads in part, \"Understanding that diversity includes women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. people, and all underrepresented minorities is at the heart of our work to create an environment that is inclusive of everyone,\" and \"I regret the choice of words I used to make this point.\"But Ms. Smith wasn't the first to endorse the view in her initial statement. Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of \"cognitive diversity\" is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of -- individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.This overlaps with the sentiments expressed in a screed by a Google software engineer that critiqued the company's race and gender diversity efforts and ascribed the unequal representation of women in tech to \"biological causes.\" It included the line, \"Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity.\"To be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important.

The leadership of Apple, where Ms. Smith works, was only 3 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic  in 2016. A recent report by Recode found that women made up at most 30 percent of leadership roles and no more than 27 percent of technical roles at major tech companies. The percentages of black and Latino employees in leadership was even more dismal, ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.The shift toward focusing on viewpoint or cognitive diversity may trace its roots back to the 1978 Supreme Court decision Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which set the stage for schools to consider race in admissions because of the educational benefits of diversity, rather than to redress prior discrimination. It is understandable that because the public discourse around affirmative action shifted along these lines, some came to believe that any kind of diversity -- including cognitive diversity -- must be equally valuable. But that means that the most meaningful ways through which this is formed (cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability and especially gender and racial differences) may be forgotten.If this happens, we could lose an important check on the tendency of people who work at tech companies to hire more people like themselves. According to the Society for Human Resources Management, employee referrals accounted for over 30 percent of all hires in 2016.

We want an equal shot regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or disability, and in this nation of laws that should be assured. But like the speed limit, such laws mean nothing unless they are strictly enforced, so a proposal by the Clinton administration to boost civil rights enforcement could make a real difference. Employers, contractors, mortgage lenders and landlords would make more decisions in a truly impartial manner if failure to do so had surer and quicker consequences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That racial barriers persist is unquestionable. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissent against a 1995 decision concerning affirmative action, was eloquent in describing them: \"Racial inequality . . . and discrimination's lingering effects . . . are evident in our workplaces, markets and neighborhoods. Job applicants with identical resumes, qualifications, and interview styles still experience different receptions, depending on their race. White and African American consumers still encounter different deals. People of color looking for housing still face discriminatory treatment by landlords, real estate agents and mortgage lenders.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The White House plan, if approved by Congress, would increase civil rights funding 17%, from $516 million to $602 million. Some Republicans may object to any increase in government. The political opposition is harder to figure. How can opponents of affirmative action, who say they only want equal opportunity, reject tougher enforcement of existing laws enforcing equality?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A current barrier to enforcement is the overworked, underbudgeted and understaffed federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Clinton proposal would increase funding by $37 million to reduce the backlog of 64,000 cases and encourage more use of mediation, which is a quicker and less costly method of resolving disputes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Justice Department's civil rights division, overseer of laws governing employment, housing, education and public accommodations, would get an 11% funding increase. To discourage housing bias, the White House would increase Housing and Urban Development Department funding by $22 million, among other things making possible the hiring of more \"testers\"--applicants identical on paper but of different racial backgrounds. Their visits to landlords and real estate agents often uncover wide disparities and are the best possible measure of compliance with fair housing laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>President Clinton seeks to engage the nation in a debate on the divisive issue of race. Dialogue is important, but actions speak louder. Strict and timely enforcement of civil rights laws will give more people the fair shot that each of us deserves.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2837300226.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Opinion: Now that affirmative action is banned, the way to level the field is one Black student at a time</h2<p>When the Supreme Court banned affirmative action in June, it triggered a new \u201ccolorblind\u201d college admissions paradigm that will add to the burden of students who are already loaded down with challenges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In California, we\u2019ve witnessed the consequences of a colorblind approach since the passage of Proposition 209, in 1996. The lessons here are instructive. The ballot measure claimed to end \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d in state schools. It resulted in a 25% reduction in Black student enrollment at state colleges and universities \u2014 the largest decline among all groups. Two decades later, UC\u2019s Black enrollment is about 5%; it was slightly more than 7% pre-Prop. 209.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the executive director of Black College Success \u2014 a community-based nonprofit that provides academic pathways to colleges and universities for hundreds of Black students in South Los Angeles \u2014 I\u2019m forced to reckon with the difficulty of improving such statistics. You should know that 75% of Black students from the Los Angeles Unified School District don\u2019t enroll in and 85% don\u2019t graduate from a four-year college or university. They come from communities where the median family income is less than $48,000 a year, and where less than 10% of community members have a college degree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Despite these terrible odds, in May, the Black College Success team celebrated the admission of 208 students to more than 40 colleges and universities, including prestigious institutions such as Stanford, Pepperdine, Pitzer, Tulane and New York University.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was far from easy for these students. For instance, Jackson, 18 and headed to a competitive school in the northeast, grew up in a single-parent household with a hardworking father who drives for Amazon, faced the challenges of being a Black man in L.A., avoiding gang life and supporting his siblings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ajaa, 17, will be a freshman at an HBCU \u2014 a historically Black college or university \u2014 in Georgia. She won more than $100,000 in scholarships while working part time to support her family, including take care of her younger brother so that her mother could attend school too.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We\u2019re not only trying to shatter the boundaries Black students from South Los Angeles face in gaining access to college, but to also help make clear the transformative opportunity that college offers their families financially for the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most of the students we work with will be the first in their families to go to college. And our help doesn\u2019t stop there. To get them to graduation (our first cohort hasn\u2019t yet reached that milestone), we follow them wherever they enroll, with continued counseling about class choices and majors and career possibilities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, how do we do it? And how will we do it in a post-affirmative action world?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There\u2019s just one way: one student at a time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First comes the work of finding and recruiting high schoolers for the program.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Beginning as early as sophomore year (as we continue to expand, we\u2019ll eventually work with students starting the moment they enter high school), a team of \u201ccollege access managers,\u201d who are from the same neighborhoods as our students and have backgrounds in college recruitment, go into our partner high schools, which have expressed an interest in working with us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The managers figuratively and literally meet the students where they are and offer them an array of supports, starting with academic planning assistance for their A-G requirements, the classes students must complete with a grade of C or better to be eligible to enter the Cal State or UC systems. No matter where students apply, the A-G standards are an objective demonstration that they\u2019re college ready.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At times, the students\u2019 need for mentoring is far greater than our capacity, so we partner with in-school resources, such as the newly created Black Student Achievement Program, and lock arms with other nonprofits like Brotherhood Crusade, 826LA, Los Angeles Urban League and others that can help us provide writing workshops, access to advanced courses and a range of extracurricular activities, stipends for summer internships, career guidance and scholarships.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once our students become seniors, they receive one-on-one college application assistance, personal statement workshops and financial aid advice. We take them on college and university visits and help them evaluate their choices. Our aim is to provide them with everything they need to level the landscape against peers who often enjoy significant advantages, such as private tutors and schools with more funding and resources than those in South L.A.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In doing this work, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not how high a student\u2019s GPA is or how impressive their test scores are that gets results. It\u2019s an all-of-the-above mix of academics, guidance and the students\u2019 own determination \u2014 the ability of a Jackson or an Ajaa to persevere.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen stories like theirs by the dozens. My fear is that, in the unfortunate new world of colorblind admissions, the opportunities available to them will diminish. If colleges and universities look past the distinctive experiences of Black applicants, it\u2019s not just the students who will lose, but society.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ibert Schultz is the executive director of Black College Success, a project of the LA Promise Fund.</p>\n"}

But it turned the era's rhetoric against itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I read the first paragraph, I was ready to give that little whippersnapper a history lesson.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"As an above-average Latino student in a predominantly Caucasian school, affirmative action is a program that would benefit me greatly,\" wrote Miguel, 17. \"As a human being, though, I feel it should be abolished.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's galling. My own flesh and blood calling for an end to a program I advocated when I was about his age. When I enrolled at UC Berkeley, there were only a handful of minorities at the prestigious campus. As human beings, we felt justified in trying to shatter the ivory tower of privilege supported at public expense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, where have all the fighters gone?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A quarter-century later, Miguel was ready to trash a hard-won solution that had clearly worked. He called it unfair. Outdated. Reverse racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I felt the urge to confront him, but I didn't. I paused, and reconsidered my knee-jerk defense of the program voters had already eliminated. I realized Miguel was right on one score: It would be unfair for him to get a break for his race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Miguel had the background and benefits he needed to succeed on his own. Both his parents are UC graduates and bilingual. His public school ranked in the nation's top 100 academically. And he wanted for nothing at home. He had his own room with his own computer and even a loft with a spiral staircase.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hardly a hard-luck case. Clearly, if he didn't make the grade, he'd have only himself to blame. Still, I couldn't agree with his conclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Why kill a program designed to compensate for social disadvantages just because you don't suffer any?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What about his less privileged peers? The students from poor areas who have to work to survive. Who sleep on couches and study in closets because their homes are so crowded. Whose parents don't speak English and don't have even high school diplomas. Whose schools are short on textbooks and good teachers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Affirmative action once pried open opportunities in an era when politicians stood in schoolhouse doors to keep minorities out. The goal was to integrate institutions that helped perpetuate racial disparities outside their ivy-covered walls.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today, disparities are still stark, but we can be more selective. We can target students who really need help. Just consider the list of high schools that send the most and the fewest students to UC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, admission and affluence are correlated. Just as race and affluence are. Communities at the top of the admissions list: Palos Verdes, Irvine, Palo Alto. Those near the bottom: Santa Ana, Compton and East San Jose, where I grew up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These underrepresented areas will be the ones to benefit most under the new plan that broadens UC eligibility to all students who rank in the top 4% of their high schools. The modest plan doesn't guarantee they'll be admitted. It simply helps identify rural and inner-city students in junior year who should be aspiring to UC, says Manuel Gomez, a UC Irvine vice chancellor and my old college friend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The university already knows an extra push can make the difference in a district like Santa Ana, which is only 3% white. A UC Irvine outreach program this year helped 23 Valley High School students boost their SAT scores by an average of almost 100 points, including one kid who soared 270 points.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The students paid $35 for the Kaplan Review, a $700 prep course. And even that nominal fee was refunded for those with perfect attendance on weekends and after school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All the kids got their money back.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I'm told the university already considers social factors in accepting students. Success in the face of adversity counts extra. That's not a race-based policy. It's just that some races see more adversity than others. That's reality-based.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Students who achieve highly within their own set of circumstances ought to be acknowledged and rewarded for it,\" said Bob Laird, director of undergraduate admissions at my alma mater.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even my son saw the light after we had a talk.

And America's. But what might an Obama victory mean for African-Americans in particular? Should we expect his administration to play a major role in black group advancement?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For more than a century, black civic leaders have tangled over whether to pursue economic independence or focus their energies on integrating political, corporate and educational institutions. W.E.B. Du Bois, author of the groundbreaking 1903 treatise, \"The Souls of Black Folk,\" argued for the latter, while his contemporary, Booker T. Washington, said \"political activity alone\" was not the answer. In addition, insisted Washington, \"you must have property, industry, skill, economy, intelligence and character.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since the 1960s, the black civil-rights leadership has sided with Du Bois. Between 1970 and 2001, the number of black elected officials in the U.S. grew from fewer than 1,500 to more than 9,000. And while impressive socioeconomic progress has been made, wide black-white gaps remain in educational achievement, homeownership rates, labor-force participation, income levels and other measures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nor should we conclude that civil-rights laws are responsible for the black progress that has occurred. For example, up until the 1950s, and in an era of open and rampant racial discrimination, the jobless rate for blacks was much lower than today and similar to that of whites in the same age group. In fact, blacks had higher labor-force participation rates than whites in every Census taken between 1890 and 1950. And in the decades preceding the 1960s -- that is, prior to the passage of landmark civil-rights bills and affirmative-action legislation -- there were sharp rises in black educational achievement, both absolutely and relative to whites.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The economist Thomas Sowell has spent decades researching racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. and abroad. And his findings -- in books like \"Race and Culture: A World View,\" \"Affirmative Action Around the World\" and \"Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?\" -- show that political activity generally has not been a factor in the rise of groups from poverty to prosperity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many Germans came to the U.S. as indentured servants during colonial times. And while working to pay off the cost of the voyage they studiously avoided participation in politics. Only after they'd risen economically did Germans begin seeking public office, culminating with the election of presidents Hoover and Eisenhower.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A similar pattern can be found among Chinese populations in southeast Asia, the Caribbean and the U.S. In Argentina, where English minorities have done well financially and played a major role in the development of the economy, they've played almost no role in Argentine politics. And so it goes with Italians in the the U.S. and Jews in Britain: In both places economic gains have generally preceded political gains. \"Empirically, political activity and political success have been neither necessary nor sufficient for economic advancement,\" writes Mr. Sowell. \"Nor has eager political participation or outstanding success in politics translated into faster group achievement.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Black Americans might keep in mind that in those rare instances where the political success of a minority group has come first, it has often resulted in slower socioeconomic progress. The Irish immigrants who came to the U.S. in the mid-19th century hailed from a country where 80% of the population was rural. Yet they settled in industrial centers like New York, Philadelphia and Boston and took low-skill jobs. Their rise from poverty was especially slow -- as late as 1920, 80% of all Irish women working in America were domestic servants -- despite the fact that Irish-run political organizations dominated many big-city governments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The Irish were fiercely loyal to each other, electing, appointing and promoting their own kind,\" writes Mr. Sowell. \"This had little effect on the average Irish American, who began to reach economic prosperity in the 20th century at about the same time when the Irish political machines began to decline.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If elected, Mr. Obama may well turn out to be a competent president, even an admirable one. But history gives us no indication that his political success will translate into black upward mobility. And given Mr. Obama's liberal leanings, there's every reason to believe that current obstacles to black progress will remain in place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The candidate favors minimum-wage laws, for example, on the assumption that they help lift people out of poverty. But most poor people already earn more than the minimum wage. And most people who earn the minimum wage aren't poor. Minimum-wage laws are more likely to price people out of the labor market, especially younger and less educated workers, a large number of whom happen to be black. Today's economy places a premium on skills. If young people can't get an entry-level job because an artificial federal wage floor has made them too expensive to hire, they can't gain the skills and experience to move up the economic ladder.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To take another example: Mr. Obama opposes educational choice, which will also have a negative impact on poor blacks, who tend to be the ones stuck in America's worst public schools. Mr. Obama opposes school vouchers that would allow low-income black parents to send their children to the type of private school where he sends his own daughters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In both cases, the only \"change\" that Mr. Obama would be bringing the Oval Office is the color of the person perpetrating bad policies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Riley is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1919844871.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Is there bias on our ballots? To avoid charges of partisanship, let an independent third party put titles and summaries on initiatives.</h2<p>Words matter. And when those words appear on the ballot, where space is limited and the competition for voter attention is high, they matter a lot.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This has become an issue for a group of Republicans who have proposed a ballot initiative to repeal a recently passed package of gas taxes and vehicle fees. On Friday, they sued California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, claiming his office put a partisan spin on the title it gave their initiative. Instead of describing the initiative in a straightforward way, saying something like \"Repeals the gas tax,\" the title says instead: \"Eliminates recently enacted road repair and transportation funding by repealing revenues dedicated for those purposes. \"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The description is accurate, as far as it goes. And even though the words \"taxes\" and \"fees\" don't appear in the title, they do appear in the summary that goes directly after the title on the signature petitions and on the ballot, if it qualifies. Anyone taking the time to read through the petition before signing it would figure out what the measure was all about.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, the title is clunky and manages to avoid the simple and direct words that would clarify what the initiative actually does. Worse yet, the initiative's proponents believe that the language was made intentionally opaque to weaken the measure's support.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ballot proponents do not get to dictate the titles that go with their proposals, but there was no reason this title had to be so tortured. Does that mean the word choice was politically motivated? Not necessarily. It could merely be the result of having been written by lawyers. Ultimately, it will be up to a judge to decide whether Becerra should rewrite the title and summary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But such complaints are unnecessarily common in situations where an attorney general from one party prepares the language for a ballot initiative pushed by people in the other party. State law gives the attorney general the responsibility of writing \"true and impartial\" titles and summaries without creating \"prejudice, for or against the proposed measure.\" Nevertheless, more than a couple of attorneys general have been accused of choosing -- or omitting -- words for the ballot title or summary to make a political point or to sway voters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, former Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, a Republican, was sued for his decision not to include the hot button words \"affirmative action\" in the summary of Proposition 209, the controversial 1996 ballot measure that ended state affirmative action programs. Former Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat, was accused of bias when she wrote the summary for a pension reform proposal. Jerry Brown, when he served as attorney general, was criticized for the language he used to describe Proposition 8, the same-sex marriage initiative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's a pretty simple solution: Give the duty to a nonpartisan third party. This idea has cropped up periodically in recent years, but hasn't gone anywhere. The most recent proposal, by Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Roseville), would reassign the writing of ballot titles and summaries to the Legislative Analyst's Office. The proposal (which would itself be in the form of a ballot initiative) was supported by California Common Cause and the League of Women Voters of California. But it was opposed by Becerra and died in its first committee hearing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kiley's bill may be dead, but this is an idea that ought to be given serious consideration by both parties. The LAO has done an admirable job of writing clear, concise and apolitical analyses of proposed legislation. It stands to reason the LAO would produce ballot titles and summaries with the same non-partisan balance and clarity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's bad enough that the titles of ballot measures are often vague and unhelpful. (Just consider two competing measures on the November statewide ballot: Proposition 62, titled simply \"Death Penalty,\" and Proposition 66, with the title \"Death Penalty. Procedures.\" Only when voters read the summary did it become clear that one measure proposed ending the death penalty in California and the other proposed speeding it up.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Voters shouldn't have to wonder also if those titles are a product of political spin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/399095057.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>American Politics Aren't 'Post-Racial'</h2<p>The not-quite-concluded racial drama playing out at Purdue University in the last months can't be ranked with the embittering rape charge scandal at Duke that so recently mesmerized the nation. And as news it's not in the same league as the total war waged against Harvard president Lawrence Summers for having had the temerity to suggest that factors in addition to prejudice might have something to do with the under-representation of women in math and the sciences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, what happened at Purdue is a pungent reminder of all that's possible now in the rarefied ideological atmosphere on our college campuses -- and in this presidential election year, not perhaps only on our campuses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The story began prosaically enough. Keith Sampson, a student employee on the janitorial staff earning his way toward a degree, was in the habit of reading during work breaks. Last October he was immersed in \"Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Sampson was in short order visited by his union representative, who informed him he must not bring this book to the break room, and that he could be fired. Taking the book to the campus, Mr. Sampson says he was told, was \"like bringing pornography to work.\" That it was a history of the battle students waged against the Klan in the 1920s in no way impressed the union rep.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The assistant affirmative action officer who next summoned the student was similarly unimpressed. Indeed she was, Mr. Sampson says, irate at his explanation that he was, after all, reading a scholarly book. \"The Klan still rules Indiana,\" Marguerite Watkins told him -- didn't he know that? Mr. Sampson, by now dazed, pointed out that this book was carried in the university library. Yes, she retorted, you can get Klan propaganda in the library.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The university has allowed no interviews with Ms. Watkins or any other university official involved in the case. Still, there can be no disputing the contents of the official letter that set forth the university's case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Sampson stood accused of \"openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your Black co-workers.\" The statement, signed by chief affirmative action officer Lillian Charleston, asserted that her office had completed its investigation of the charges brought by Ms. Nakea William, his co- worker -- that Mr. Sampson had continued, despite complaints, to read a book on this \"inflammatory topic.\" \"We conclude,\" the letter informed him, \"that your conduct constitutes racial harassment. . . .\" A very serious matter, with serious consequences, it went on to point out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That was in November. Months later, in February of this year, Mr. Sampson received -- from the same source -- a letter with an astonishingly transformed version of his offense. And there could be no mystery as to the cause of this change.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the official judgment against him, Mr. Sampson turned to Indiana state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, whose office contacted university attorneys. Worse, the case got some sharp local press coverage that threatened to get wider.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ludicrous harassment cases are not rare at our institutions of higher learning. But there was undeniably something special -- something pure, and glorious -- in the clarity of this picture. A university had brought a case against a student on grounds of a book he had been reading.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And so the new letter to Mr. Sampson by affirmative action officer Charleston brought word that she wished to clarify her previous letter, and to say it was \"permissible for him to read scholarly books or other materials on break time.\" About the essential and only theme of the first letter -- the \"racially abhorrent\" subject of the book -- or the warnings that any \"future substantiated conduct of a similar nature could mean serious disciplinary action\" -- there was not a word. She had meant in that first letter, she said, only to address \"conduct\" that caused concern among his co-workers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What that conduct was, the affirmative action officer did not reveal -- but she had delivered the message rewriting the history of the case. Absolutely and for certain there had been no problem about any book he had been reading.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This, indeed, was now the official story -- as any journalist asking about the case would learn instantly from the university's media relations representatives. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved -- if not much -- by the extraordinary efforts of these tormented agents trying to explain that the first letter was all wrong: No reading of any book had anything to do with the charges against Mr. Sampson. This means, I asked one, that Mr. Sampson could have been reading about the adventures of Jack and Jill and he still would have been charged? Yes. What, then, was the offense? \"Harassing behavior.\" While reading the book? The question led to careful explanations hopeless in tone -- for good reason -- and well removed from all semblance of reason. What the behavior was, one learned, could never be revealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There was, of course, no other offensive behavior; had there been any it would surely have appeared in the first letter's gusher of accusation. Like those prosecutors who invent new charges when the first ones fail in court, the administrators threw in the mysterious harassment count. Such were the operations of the university's guardians of equity and justice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In April -- having been pressed by the potent national watchdog group FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) as well as the ACLU -- University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz finally sent them a letter expressing regret over this affair, and testifying to his profound commitment to freedom of expression. So far as can be ascertained, the university has extended no such expressions of regret to Keith Sampson.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This case and all its kind are worth bearing in mind for anyone pondering the hypersensitivity surrounding the issue of race today. The mindset that produces those harassment courts, those super-heated capacities for perceiving insult, is not limited to college campuses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Its presence is evident in this election campaign, which has seen more than a touch of readiness to impute some form of racism to all tough criticisms of Barack Obama. The deranged response that greeted Bill Clinton's remark that certain of Sen. Obama's claims were \"a fairy tale,\" told the story. No need to go into the now famous catalogue of accusations about the Clintons' \"sly racist\" tactics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There will be much more ahead, directed to the Republicans and their candidate. Some more, no doubt, about the Willie Horton ad of 1988, whose status as a quintessential piece of racism is -- except for a few rare voices of reason -- accepted throughout our media as revealed truth. To be sure, the Willie Horton charge has for some time been over-shadowed by ominous predictions of all the Swiftboating Republicans are supposed to be readying.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And Mr. Obama himself, the candidate of racial transcendence, has now taken a plunge of sorts to old-style race politics. In a preemptive dismissal of future criticism, he warned a Florida audience on June 20, of the racist tactics the Republicans planned. \"We know the strategy,\" he said. Republicans planned to make people afraid of him. They'd say \"he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All this may be far from the world of the universities. But to those aforementioned campus ideologues, the thinking is familiar.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Correction</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yesterday's op-ed article by Dorothy Rabinowitz, \"American Politics Aren't 'Post-Racial',\" misstated the name of the university.

Indiana University is the managing partner of IUPUI and is \"fully under the administrative authority of Indiana University,\" according to a Purdue spokesman, who added that \"Purdue University officials were not consulted and in no way were involved in any aspect of [Keith] Sampson's case.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(WSJ July 8, 2008)</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1548604795.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>U.T. Austin's affirmative action program is a careful effort to ensure diversity (Posted 2014-07-28 00:15:53)</h2<p>LAST YEAR, the Supreme Court ordered the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to reconsider the affirmative-action program at the University of Texas at Austin. This month, the appeals court determined again that the university's admissions policies were constitutional. This was not much of a surprise: The 5th Circuit sided with the university the last time it examined this case. Much less predictable is how the Supreme Court will rule when the dispute comes before the justices for a second time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We wouldn't accuse them of having an easy task. Every American should be wary of any instance in which the government distinguishes between people based on race, with bad or good motivations. But in its ruling, the 5th Circuit offered the justices several good reasons to side with the university. Among them: If, as the justices have said, the Constitution can bear public universities instituting some kind of narrow, careful affirmative-action admissions policies, UT Austin's modest program is a prime example of the sort that should survive judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Texas fills most of the seats at its premier public university with students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school classes -- state policy guarantees them admission. This has had the effect of drawing some students from areas of the state where minorities make up the majority without distinguishing among students based on race. The case is about what the university can do from there. UT fills the rest of its classes with students who get in under a comprehensive, holistic review of their academic and personal records. In that analysis, race can be used as \"a factor of a factor of a factor of a factor,\" as advocates put it, as admissions officers assemble a complete picture of an applicant's profile. The 5th Circuit points out that this resembles the sort of individualized review of applicants that the Supreme Court has insisted must occur if race is to be explicitly considered in public university admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The university's opponents charge that the affirmative-action policy is unnecessary. The top 10 percent program already pulls in minority students. Why do any more?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among the reasons are the fact that the top 10 percent scheme's effects on diversity stem from ongoing racial segregation in Texas schools. The scheme also is a blunt tool that overlooks applicants who want to and would contribute to the university. The experience of a minority applicant from a majority minority school, for example, may well be quite different than that of a minority applicant from a majority white school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another lesson from the 5th Circuit's ruling: One reason this and other affirmative-action cases are difficult is that the Supreme Court has not offered public university officials clear guidance on what is constitutionally acceptable. According to the court, public universities, for example, can attempt to achieve a \"critical mass\" of minority students on campus to expose students to diverse viewpoints and prepare them to participate in a multi-ethnic society. What a \"critical mass\" looks like, though, is not certain. The Supreme Court should clear up the confusion. In the process, the justices should affirm that UT's conscientiously designed affirmative-action program, a cautious effort to complement the race-neutral top 10 percent program and seek diversity from a range of student profiles, is permissible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398612922.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Business world: If you hear the forbidden word, everybody get real stupid</h2<p>I wasted a weekend listening to the Texaco tapes, figuring it was the least I could do before casting the company and its former treasurer, Robert Ulrich, into the outer darkness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And it would have been a great column: The tapes were impossibly muddy; there was no way to tell if Mr. Ulrich had used the dreaded \"n\" word; the purblind media, from the New York Times and Ted Koppel on down, was nuts for insisting that \"black jelly bean\" was a racist term; etc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Alas for journalism if not for justice, Texaco spent the week working electronic magic on the tape, and lo, the mystery word turns out to be \"Nicholas,\" and \"jelly bean\" is an approved Texaco metaphor for multicultural togetherness. It would be nice if CEO Peter Bijur would now lob a few bons mots at journalistic sanctimony, although this seems unlikely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But we can still enjoy the larger point: There was a time when journalists aspired to the sensibility of novelists, to some semblance of psychological depth, rather than running around like salivating trolls playing \"gotcha.\" This would have been an excellent opportunity for that earlier breed to assert themselves, given the gift of the tapes -- a fly-on-the-wall peek at real life that every journalist dreams of.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But of course the \"n\" word has become such a taboo, the mere rumor of its utterance becomes a salacious story by itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this case another hackneyed stereotype was thrown into the mix -- EVIL BUSINESSMEN -- and a whole seven-day news conflagration was built on a lie. The transcripts provided by the attorneys, of course, were abysmal. But even the transcripts make it clear that Mr. Ulrich is referring to everyone at Texaco as jelly beans, regardless of color: \"You can't have just `we' and `them.' You can't just have black jelly beans and other jelly beans. It doesn't work.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Jelly beans were in the air at Texaco: On an earlier bit of tape, Mr. Lundwall is heard saying \"yum\" and offering a female colleague a jelly bean. (She declines.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even more amazing was the failure to draw on the depth of insight available from the tapes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They were secretly recorded by a participant whose motives remain a mystery: Richard Lundwall, a manager in the finance department, was subsequently let go; his tapes seem to consist of random incidents from a day in the life Texaco. We hear him straightening out the matter of a departed employee who may have swiped a laptop. We hear him waxing lyrical over the filet mignon at the Texaco cafeteria. We hear him making nondescript phone calls.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But most of all, we peer into his department as it wrestles with conflicting goals that should have sent journalistic synapses firing in all directions, awakening the slumbering cognitive organ: downsizing and affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the tapes make clear over and over, Texaco's finance department was being prodded from on high to reduce costs by getting rid of bodies. \"We shrink very systematically,\" one manager is heard saying. \"We absorb the job and do a lot of crosstraining.\" In another instance: \"Everybody who leaves, leaves with a smile on their face\" -- referring to the effort to coax people out the door with early retirement and generous severance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We also hear survivors comparing their lot with those who left, including some who jumped to Wall Street. This prompts a discussion about the relative advantages of packing your lifetime earnings into a few stress-laden, workaholic years or spreading them out over a 30-year career of easy hours at Texaco.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But along with downsizing, the department was being pushed to upsize minority and female representation. At one point Mr. Lundwall suggests recruiting at \"Howard or Temple or [other] predominantly black schools\" where students are allowed to advance \"simply on the basis of scholastic merit.\" Other MBA programs, he says, are \"under the same gun as corporations\" to promote by quota.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If it bothered anybody to be firing colleagues while recruiting minorities, it doesn't show. But there is evidence of stress over race within the organization -- far more interesting and reliable evidence than an indecipherable word that some self-interested lawyer claims is \"nigger.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Lundwall jokes about wearing his Viking hat during National Odin Month -- \"I'm celebrating my heritage.\" Then he and Mr. Ulrich riff about the \"black\" national anthem, which evidently some Texaco employees had sung at a company event the previous year. Mr. Lundwall says, \"When they sat during `ours' -- listen to me, during `ours,' as though they're not included -- and stood for their modified one, I apologize to nobody for walking out of there.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What follows is a series of inaudible mumbles and gaps in the recording, out of which supposedly emerged the offensive comment by Mr. Ulrich. But the tone is jocular rather than angry. Elsewhere, Mr. Ulrich can be heard reviewing employment records and remarking with satisfaction on the advancement of women and minorities. And in a discussion of how to talk prospective downsizees out the door, Mr. Ulrich comes across rather well -- sensitive yet realistic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The press might have thrown this evidence onto the scale when weighing whether \"nunjunah\" was really \"nigger.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Calls around Texaco last week didn't find anybody willing to say, on the record or off, what sort of guy Mr. Ulrich was, even though Mr. Bijur and the rest worked side by side with him for years. Their desire to duck this question was not hard to fathom: If Mr. Ulrich were a hardened racist, they should have booted him out long ago. If he were a decent guy, defending him now would violate the first rule of post-Tylenol crisis management, which is never defend yourself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sadly, having scored this slamdunk over various Interfaith Councils for Decrying Big Business, the company blithers that the tapes are still \"troubling.\" But Texaco must live in the world, and will certainly cough up generously to settle the lawsuit and become exemplary for its \"diversity\" programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for the rest of us, we might conclude that senior executives of Big Oil are honestly at sea over \"diversity\" -- as these tapes clearly reveal -- no less than anyone else is. The muckraking publication Sales & Marketing Management recently pointed out to its readers that \"African-Americans confront stereotypes that make it difficult for them to sell to [white] customers.\" Who could doubt it? And yet the same presumably liberal California voters who plumped heavily for Bill Clinton last week also decided that racial preferences are the wrong solution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given the honest uncertainty, perhaps we should accept that there is more to human dignity than twisting ourselves into pretzels of \"sensitivity.\" And keeping a few old goats around at Texaco who remember when the business of an oil company was finding oil, not color-coding jelly beans, may not be such a bad thing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: On the Basis of Merit Only\" -- WSJ Nov. 19, 1996)</p>\n"}

Davies, was \u201cuncowed,\u201d the chief justice wrote, despite being \u201cphysically threatened.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cA judicial system cannot and should not live in fear,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts added as he thanked Congress for passing a law last year to protect judges. The new law was named in honor of Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, who was murdered in 2020 in an assault meant for the judge at her home. The law screens from the public the personal information of federal judges and their families, including identifiers such as license plate numbers and addresses. Leaders like the chief justice deserve praise when they highlight the dangers all public officials now face.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Focusing on the Brown decision was nonetheless surprising. After all, the court appears poised to reverse a decision upholding affirmative action in school admissions, one of the very remedies that the Brown decision spawned, and which all nine members of the court stood squarely behind in 1954 and reaffirmed in a subsequent case in 1958.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In past years, the chief justice sometimes used his year-end report to describe substantive reforms in the federal courts, like the task force created in 2018 in response to allegations that federal judges had harassed their staffs sexually and in other ways. Not so in his latest report, which was four pages long with a five-page appendix. Chief Justice Roberts did not mention any of the many issues that made the news about the court last year \u2014 the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices whose actions or those of family members raise questions about impartiality, the leak of a draft of the court\u2019s decision overturning abortion rights, the insufficiency of financial disclosure and questions about fund-raising for the Supreme Court Historical Society.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nor did the chief justice explore the troubling data in his report\u2019s appendix on \u201cthe workload of the courts.\u201d The numbers document a sharp decline of the use of the federal courts. Federal appellate filings fell again in the fiscal year 2022, a steady decline from 49,000 in 2018 to fewer than 42,000 last year. Trial-level civil cases in the federal district courts have fallen precipitously as well \u2014 down from more almost 283,000 cases in 2018 to about 240,000 in 2022.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In calculating totals and the trend in civil cases, court administrators did not include about 321,000 filings that, starting in 2020, were brought by military service members and veterans who claimed that combat earplugs sold by 3M to the U.S. military were faulty. Under a federal statute, those cases became, in effect, one litigation, consolidated before trial in front of a single judge, and they are an example of the importance of people having access to courts, which can no longer be taken for granted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The opinions of the very court that the chief justice leads provide insight into the decline. We know from our own experience that savvy civil rights lawyers now steer clear of federal court. Winning in the appellate courts risks having the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority extinguish any gains won for women, prisoners, the environment and more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The dwindling numbers of filings at the trial level in the U.S. District Courts also derive in part from what the Supreme Court has done during the last few decades \u2014 to close the courthouse doors to many would-be litigants, in class-action lawsuits and other cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A key example can be found in the court\u2019s interpretations of the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In a series of cases that began in the 1980s, the court has read the statute to mean that employers and businesses can include arbitration clauses in lengthy, dense, fine-print documents with consumers and employees that bar access to courts and to class actions. Even complaints of violations of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and of federal laws regulating securities, fair credit, unlawful mergers and unfair business practices can be forced into arbitration rather than being litigated in court. Anyone aggrieved has to go, one by one, to private arbitration. In practice, almost none do, because most people don\u2019t have the resources to pursue small-value claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In contrast, the veterans in the combat earplug cases were able to get into court because no arbitration mandate kept them out. And once in court, because of procedures designed to make group-based litigation easier, they could combine resources to pursue their arguments of hearing loss and tinnitus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The \u201cstate of the judiciary\u201d address is a bully pulpit constructed decades ago by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Given the challenges the country faces, we need a chief justice who helps us all talk seriously about what ails the federal courts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s focus on 1950s desegregation litigation is a poignant reminder that once federal courts led the way in protecting civil rights and making courts accessible to all. His court, however, has made plain it has no interest in opening doors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For that, we need Congress to reinvigorate federal rights and end the power of would-be defendants to control access. That\u2019s what Congress did in 2022 when it amended the 1925 arbitration statute to let victims of sexual assault and harassment decide if they want to sue in court rather than consider using arbitration. The chief justice properly commended Congress for making strides in protecting federal judges. Now Congress needs to protect and support the right to bring cases to those judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nancy Gertner, a retired Federal District Court judge, is a senior lecturer in law at Harvard Law School.

{"id": "txt/1761271674.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Ease the poverty penalty in college admissions</h2<p>Harold O. Levy is executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I was chancellor of the New York City schools, I thought that if you were smart and poor, you could write your own ticket to college. I was dead wrong.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A new study by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, where I serve as executive director, reveals that only 3 percent of students at our most selective colleges come from the 25 percent of families with the lowest incomes, while 72 percent come from the richest 25 percent of families.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The unfairness of the situation is compounded by the fact that once admitted, poor students soar academically. According to our study, the poor students who do attend these elite schools graduate at equal rates and earn similarly high grades as their wealthy peers. The Cooke Foundation awards scholarships to exceptionally high-achieving low-income students; 95 percent of Cooke Scholars graduate from these selective schools with top grades.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today at selective colleges we have affirmative action for the wealthy. More than 80 percent of the nation's top higher-education institutions give a \"legacy preference\" to children of alumni. Even the \"athletic preference\" has been warped to give the rich a better shot. Football and basketball - in which poor and minority children excel in large numbers - get the most exposure, but more student-athletes get a leg up at elite institutions in sports such as squash, sailing, crew, horseback riding, fencing and water polo. There aren't many water polo coaches in the New York City school system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The academic playing field is otherwise skewed against smart poor children. The wealthy student gets a tutor (or at least a test-prep course) and can submit his or her best scores to colleges after taking the SAT or ACT multiple times. In contrast, the child of poverty gets a single test-fee waiver and takes the test only once and \"cold.\" (The College Board, to its credit, has sought to address the situation by offering Khan Academy test-prep services at no charge, which, although not the equivalent of one-on-one tutoring, is at least something.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Early-admissions programs that require a student to commit to attending a school if accepted also unfairly hold back the poor. Early admission is an easier path to acceptance, worth as much as an extra 100 SAT points, according to one report . But children of poverty can't apply early, because they can't commit to a particular school until they know how much their financial aid package will be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It goes on like this. Students from poverty are also often ill-advised by their high school counselors about college options. Public school counselors are stretched too thin - each advises, on average, hundreds of students - to give each student in-depth attention. So it is hardly surprising that only 23 percent of high-achieving low-income students even apply to a selective school, compared with more than twice as many - 48 percent - high-achieving students from families with higher incomes. As a result, many students are unaware of scholarships they are qualified to receive, and therefore don't apply to these seemingly expensive selective schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While some schools do make attempts to find high-performing low-income students, the overall impact is meager. To reduce the impact of the poverty penalty levied against the brightest low- income students, we need a serious poverty preference in admissions to elite colleges and universities - amounting to affirmative action for these students. We do not advocate reducing the role of standardized tests, because admissions officers must have a way to compare students across schools. Without reducing standardized test requirements, admissions officers need to give more credit to low-income students for having achieved at a high level despite not having the advantages of enrichment courses, internships and foreign travel. This would help to level the playing field and open the door of opportunity for academically qualified students to attend schools that match their abilities. It would also provide a backdoor way to maintain ethnic diversity in colleges, particularly if the Supreme Court does away with race-conscious affirmative action in admissions in a case pending this term involving the University of Texas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When many high-achieving low-income students apply to our nation's top institutions of higher learning, they face a far harder road than more affluent students. Rather than get credit for having successfully overcome obstacles, they face an even more arduous path. All young people in the United States should have a fair chance at academic success, based on true merit, regardless of how much money their parents have. Having wealthy parents doesn't make you smarter or more deserving of college admission. It just means you won the parent lottery.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Harold O. Levy</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2053215813.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Diversity at what cost?</h2<p>It is amazing to me that President Trump has not, on a rare day when he's in New York, exited Trump Tower, made a sharp left, and limousined down to Stuyvesant High School. It is New York City's crown jewel, where - like in the fictional Lake Wobegon - all the students really are \"above average.\" And just to make matters more intriguing and complicated, Stuyvesant's student body is majority Asian American</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>. The mayor thinks this is a \"monumental injustice\" and that more of the students should be Hispanic and black. For that, he recently asked congregants at a black church for an \"amen.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Instead, from certain critics, he got a groan of opposition and disbelief. In the name of racial equity, fairness and that most deceptive of all words, diversity, he would demolish a system that at Stuyvesant and seven other elite city high schools has, without a doubt, propelled countless poor kids right into the middle class - and beyond.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The reason I mentioned Trump in the first paragraph is that his base consists, in no small part, of white males who think the deck is stacked against them; that the liberal policies of the Obama years, personified by Hillary Clinton, unfairly favored other groups or, when it came to trade, other nations. You and I may quibble with this view, but then along comes Mayor Bill de Blasio to demand an \"amen\" to his efforts to tilt a color-blind admissions system to get a different blend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Blacks and Hispanics comprise 67 percent</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>of New York's public school students. Yet Stuyvesant's incoming freshman class contains only 10 black students, 27 Hispanics, 151 whites - and 613 Asian Americans. A similar imbalance applies to the city's seven other elite schools, including Brooklyn Tech, where the mayor's son just graduated. Clearly, something is off. In the best of all possible worlds, these schools should have student bodies that reflect the city's demographics. This, though, is not the best of all worlds. It's the one we have.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And in this world, the children of Asian immigrants walk away with the lion's share of admissions. Why? Simple. They study. They study hard. Admissions to New York's academically elite schools is based solely on an entrance exam. That's it. No alumni recommendations. No offer of a contribution. No athletic ability or anything of the sort. Take the test. Score high. Get in. Nothing could be fairer. Yet, de Blasio, a Democrat, wants to do away with the exam all together.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In an exhaustive piece for the City Journal about Brooklyn's Chinese American community - one of New York's several Chinatowns - Kay S. Hymowitz writes that \"If, as sometimes appears the case, 'Harvard' is the first English word that immigrant Chinese mothers learn, the second is probably 'Stuyvesant.' \"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reading Hymowitz's description of how these parents work around the clock for their children - rising before dawn to ensure that homework is done - is exhausting in itself. Often, they put aside money to have their kids prepped for the Stuyvesant admissions test. This is not a perk of the rich. This is yet another sacrifice these parents make for their children.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My limited tolerance for affirmative action - possibly permissible when the poor are advantaged at the expense of the rich - hits a wall in this case. By and large, the Asian Americans of Stuyvesant are not rich. Many of them are poor, so-called Title I kids, entitled to all sorts of aid. They and their parents played by the rules and studied hard. Why should they be deprived - on the basis of race or ethnicity - of what they earned? That's what the mayor wants to happen. Asian American kids have to make way for black or Hispanic ones.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The figures are both stark and tragic. But they prove, to the obstinate blindness of the doctrinaire, that poverty is not always the determinant. You can hardly get poorer than many of the Asian immigrants. They come to America with little. Many can't even speak English. In her article, Hymowitz says Chinese families often \"maintain that they have been discriminated against, and they tell their children to expect discrimination as well.\" It's a hard, hard life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Already, the mayor has reserved some slots for students whoalmostpass the exam so that more black and Hispanic kids will be admitted to the special schools. For him, it is only a beginning. In the name of diversity, he wants to scrap the test and, thereby, destroy a system that epitomized the American dream and - as Trump might say - made America great.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>cohenr@washpost.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Richard Cohen</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1518236735.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>No time for cowards: Let's talk about race</h2<p>When it comes to race in America, the last thing I'd want is to be  considered a coward.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But then, it's so easy to be cowardly in America when it comes to  race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's not normal for people to take positions that can leave them  vulnerable and make it easy for others to brand them as racist and  then shun them. Such pressure is a fact of American life. So  instead of talking, they clam up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Their lips may stop moving. But they don't stop thinking. And  Attorney General Eric Holder said as much shortly after Barack  Obama was elected president of the United States.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic  melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to  be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards,\" said Holder  in 2009.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was a shocking speech, and rather silly, given that America had  just proved the opposite of cowardice by electing the first  African-American president. But there is also truth in it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Our politics are consumed by race. Our governments use race to hand  out public contracts, and to pick winners and losers when it comes  to political/public jobs. Our universities have de-emphasized merit  in admissions policy while considering skin pigmentation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All of that is wrong, corrosive and, at bottom, positively  un-American.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So when the Supreme Court this week ruled that Michigan voters had  the right to ban racial preferences in university admissions, some  thoughts came to mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One was optimism. By allowing states to ban the use of skin color  as leverage, we move toward the goal of a post-racial society.  Keeping racial preferences in place guarantees we remain divided.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But remove them, allow merit to dictate success, and pressure will  increase on local communities to improve public education at the  elementary and high school levels.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those young people on the South and West sides of Chicago, those  children who are among the ones gunned down every day, aren't  helped by the current system. They're not the elites. They're not  going to the University of Michigan. Too many are not even getting  out of high school alive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The ugly secret is that racial-preference politics helps the elites  most of all, by helping those who have been poised to take  advantage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And what about a white kid who didn't grow up with a silver spoon  in his mouth? Is he any less human than others?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And does the daughter of a black bank vice president -- or the  daughter of a U.S. president -- need political help over the son of  a white construction worker? No. But a culture that prizes merit  will force changes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>America has a long and ugly history of racial discrimination,  beginning with slavery and continuing through modern times, from  the unions started by white immigrants to keep blacks out of work  in the North, to poll taxes in the South.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Racial preferences were instituted to address those wrongs. I  understand the why of it, but here's the problem: If it's wrong to  use race to deny people opportunities, it is equally wrong to use  race to help some at the expense of others.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Using skin color rather than merit to pick winners and losers is a  policy that fosters cynicism. Such policies only serve the  politicians, who hand out the spoils, using racial preference as  governmental levers as they win power and treasure for themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All that has to change, and it won't change unless we divorce  ourselves from the skin game.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And then I thought of Holder.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He's gone back to that well -- the one full of racial cowards in  America -- since that original 2009 speech. His comments obviously  created controversy, with some thinking the word \"cowardice\" was a  bit much.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"It's a question of being honest with ourselves and racial issues  that divide us,\" Holder told journalists at a news conference  called shortly afterward. \"It's not easy to talk about it. We have  to have the guts to be honest with each other, accept criticism,  accept new proposals.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So let's have the guts to be honest, Mr. Attorney General. Let's  get rid of racial preferences immediately.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is a race industry in politics. And many elites -- from  politicians to journalists -- continue to argue in favor of  race-based policy. But here's the thing: Mr. Obama was elected  twice. Twice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He won't be the last minority elected to high office in this  country. And I'm confident that race will become increasingly  irrelevant when it comes to success or failure. If it doesn't,  we'll all fail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's no point in being cowardly any longer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"This case is not about how the debate (over racial preferences)  should be resolved,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the court's  ruling announced Tuesday. But, he added, to stop Michigan voters  from making their own decision on affirmative action would be \"an  unprecedented restriction on a fundamental right held by all in  common.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most government officials and journalists call it \"affirmative  action.\" That's the polite reference suggesting that the government  is affirming our rights. But that's not what it does. It  discriminates. And in matters of race, I prefer to call things what  they are. Affirmative action is nothing but racial preference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Success should be based on hard work and merit, not on skin  pigmentation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Racial preference has nothing to do with merit. But it has  everything to do with politics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>jskass@tribune.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Twitter @John_Kass</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: Photo: Attorney General Eric Holder drew attention in 2009 for his  comments on race.

{"id": "txt/2666140890.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Think about this when judging race-based college admissions</h2<p>In 12 months, the nation might be approximately where it is now, with Cassandras claiming democracy hangs by a frayed thread that the Supreme Court might snip. Then, the subject will not be abortion but racial preferences in college admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Such preferences \u2014 race-based allocations of opportunity \u2014 deepen social divisions, exacerbate identity politics and repudiate the individualism of the nation's natural-rights tradition. By June 2023, however, the Supreme Court will rule on the challenge brought by plaintiffs against what they say are racially discriminatory practices of Harvard College and the University of North Carolina. Before then, the justices should study an essay (\"The Sausage Factory\") recently published by Gail Heriot, of the University of San Diego School of Law, and attorney Carissa Mulder. It demonstrates the disconnect between the Supreme Court-approved rationale for preferences and colleges' actual practices and their purposes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Two 2003 cases involved the University of Michigan. In one, the court declared unconstitutional the undergraduate admissions policy of adding 20 points \u2014 equivalent to an entire letter grade \u2014 to the admissions scores of certain favored minorities. In another, the court upheld the Michigan law school's preference policy because, although its magnitude of discrimination was larger, it did not involve an explicit formula. The court decided universities deserved deference for non-formulaic preference policies because the institutions were guided by considerations of pedagogy \u2014 academic benefits of \"diversity\" for all students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The nine justices agreed that the law school's policy was racially discriminatory, and hence the school had to demonstrate that the policy was \"narrowly tailored\" to serve a \"compelling\" interest. But, say Heriot and Mulder, the court majority \"eviscerated\" this supposedly strict standard by saying the court should \"defer\" to the law school's \"educational judgment,\" and to \"academic freedom.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One cannot, the authors say, simultaneously \"strictly scrutinize a government's actions and defer to its judgment.\" The court's deference \"put a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of race discrimination. But ... the Court is supposed to do everything it can to avoid approving race discrimination and instead to favor race neutrality.\" And, the authors say, it is inconceivable \"that academic freedom would have been sufficient to justify any other form of race discrimination.\" In the 1950s, there were many education experts who believed that \"students learn better in racially segregated schools.\" Fortunately, the court then exercised its own judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since then, Heriot and Mulder say, the court has not explained \"why, alone among government instrumentalities, public colleges and universities should be exempt from the strong presumption against racially discriminatory laws and policies (or why, alone among industries, private colleges and universities should be exempt).\" Research into schools' practices shows that race-based admissions are the product not of empirical educational research but \"of political winds from both inside and outside each institution,\" and are intended to keep campus peace and attract funds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The authors correctly say, \"The quality of a college education is a difficult thing to judge, especially in the short run,\" so education is \"prone to fads,\" especially politically fashionable ones. Today's fad \u2014 racial monomania \u2014 deepens the contradictory nature of the argument for the constitutionality of race-based admissions: Preferences supposedly improve the diversity pertinent to education \u2014 diversity of views \u2014 yet also dissolve stereotypes about race being a reliable indicator of mentalities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Presenting \"diversity\" as an educational benefit for all students is academia's way of justifying racial discrimination actually intended for aims that the Supreme Court has not said justify such discrimination \u2014 \"social justice,\" or compensation for past injuries. As Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy, who supports affirmative action, writes, many advocates of racial preferences in the name of diversity's benefits (\"only a contingent, pedagogical hypothesis\") \"would rightly defend affirmative action even if social science demonstrated uncontrovertibly that diversity (or its absence) has no effect (or even a negative effect) on the learning environment.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Michigan law school case assumed, Heriot and Mulder say, the educational benefits of racial diversity and assumed that these benefits were the school's motivation for racially discriminatory admissions. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, alluding to a 1978 case, wrote for the court's five-justice majority in 2003: \" 'Good faith' ... is 'presumed' absent 'a showing to the contrary.' \"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But why this presumption, given academia's politics and fads, and given that the supposed educational benefits of diversity remain a (politically convenient) \"pedagogical hypothesis\"? Next year, the Supreme Court's duty will be to exercise its judgment, not to defer to such presumptions.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2062788420.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>A Misguided Obsession With Civility</h2<p>Recent disruptive protests -- from diners at Mexican restaurants in the capital calling the White House adviser Stephen Miller a fascist to protesters in Pittsburgh blocking rush-hour traffic after a police shooting of an unarmed teen -- have provoked bipartisan alarm. The CNN commentator David Gergen compared the anti-Trump resistance unfavorably to 1960s protests, saying, \"The antiwar movement in Vietnam, the civil rights movement in the '60s and early '70s, both of those were more civil in tone -- even the antiwar movement was more civil in tone, but certainly the civil rights movement, among the people who were protesting.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But those who say that the civil rights movement prevailed because of civil dialogue misunderstand protest and political change.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This misunderstanding is widespread. Democratic leaders have lashed out at an epidemic of uncivil behavior in their own ranks. Senator Charles Schumer described the \"harassment of political opponents\" as \"not American.\" His alternative: polite debate. \"If you disagree with someone or something, stand up, make your voice heard, explain why you think they're wrong and why you're right.\" Democrat Cory Booker joined the chorus. \"We've got to get to a point in our country where we can talk to each other, where we are all seeking a more beloved community. And some of those tactics that people are advocating for, to me, don't reflect that spirit.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The theme: We need a little more love, a little more Martin Luther King, a dollop of Gandhi. Be polite, be civil, present arguments thoughtfully and reasonably. Appeal to people's better angels. Take the moral high ground above Trump and his supporters' low road. Above all, don't disrupt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This sugarcoating of protest has a long history. During the last major skirmish in the civility wars two decades ago, when President Bill Clinton held a national conversation about race to dampen tempers about welfare reform, affirmative action and a controversial crime bill, the Yale law professor Stephen Carter argued that King \"understood that uncivil dialogue serves no democratic function.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But, in fact, civil rights leaders, while they did believe in the power of nonviolence, knew that their success depended on disruption and coercion as much -- sometimes more -- than on dialogue and persuasion. They knew that the vast majority of whites who were indifferent or openly hostile to the demands of civil rights would not be moved by appeals to the American creed or to bromides about liberty and justice for all. Polite words would not change their behavior.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For King and his allies, the key moment was spring 1963, a contentious season when polite discourse gave way to what many called the \"Negro Revolt.\" That year, King led a mass demonstration in Birmingham, Ala., deliberately planned to provoke police violence. After the infamous police commissioner Bull Connor sicced dogs on schoolchildren and arrested hundreds, including King, angry black protesters looted Birmingham's downtown shopping district. Protesters against workplace discrimination in Philadelphia and New York deployed increasingly disruptive tactics, including blockading construction sites, chaining themselves to cranes and clashing with law enforcement officials. Police forces around the United States began girding for what they feared was an impending race war.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whites both North and South, moderate and conservative, continued to denounce advocates of civil rights as \"un-American\" and destructive throughout the 1960s. Agonized moderates argued that mass protest was counterproductive. It would alienate potential white allies and set the goal of racial equality back years, if not decades. Conservatives more harshly criticized the movement. By 1966, more than two-thirds of Americans disapproved of King.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>King aimed some of his harshest words toward advocates of civility, whose concerns aligned with the hand-wringing of many of today's politicians and pundits. From his Birmingham jail cell, King wrote: \"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice.\" King knew that whites' insistence on civility usually stymied civil rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those methods of direct action -- disruptive and threatening -- spurred the Kennedy administration to move decisively. On June 11, the president addressed the nation on the \"fires of frustration and discord that are burning in every city, North and South, where legal remedies are not at hand.\" Kennedy, like today's advocates of civility, was skeptical of \"passionate movements.\" He criticized \"demonstrations, parades and protests which create tensions and threaten violence and threaten lives.\" But he also had to put out those fires.

{"id": "txt/418325715.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>AN ERA OF CRYSTAL-CLEAR VIEWS</h2<p>Education reform lost one of its most important leaders last week with the death of Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, whose 900,000 members teach in large cities including Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. I also lost a good friend and mentor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I worked for Al for nearly eight years, most of that time as editor of the AFT's magazine American Educator, before joining the Reagan administration in 1983. Al Shanker was an outspoken critic of racial quotas and preferences, a proponent of teaching English to immigrant children and a lifelong anti-communist. He helped shape my views on affirmative action, bilingual education and foreign policy. He was also a tough union man and a Democratic Party activist who sometimes privately lamented the direction his party or the labor movement might take on a given issue but remained a staunch loyalist nonetheless.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In recent years, Al Shanker's most vital contribution was as the often lone voice in the education establishment promoting high academic standards for public schools. He had little patience with the fads that have wreaked havoc in public education in the last 25 years: values clarification, multiculturalism, the self-esteem movement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He believed schools were places where children should be taught history and literature, science and math; where they would learn that democracy was the best form of government; and where teachers were unafraid of teaching right from wrong or helping mold their students' character. He believed in homework and tough, demanding course work for which students would be graded on what they learned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His views did not always endear him to his political allies, even, at rare times, to members of his own union, though they continued to elect him president for more than 22 years. Shanker's following extended far beyond the union movement, however, largely because of a weekly column he published as an advertisement in the Sunday New York Times. Until his health began to fail recently, Al wrote the column himself every week, hammering out brave positions on controversial issues on an old typewriter and, in later years, a laptop computer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even his last column, which appeared the day after he died, took on the poppycock that sometimes passes for education theory these days: \"For years, promoters of the self-esteem movement have been asserting that low self-esteem is responsible for many of our students' social ills and academic problems. Their prescription? Give students big doses of praise and assure them that they are `special' and doing very well, even if their performance is mediocre or poor.\" Shanker warned that this could be dangerous, promoting \"conceit, pride, feelings of superiority and entitlement. How many parents would want to encourage these attitudes in a child?\" he asked.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like so many of his columns, this one drew its inspiration from a piece in a scholarly research journal. He was an avid and eclectic reader who loved to pass on favorite articles to friends and colleagues and to summarize them in his column. To the end, he remained a teacher.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With Al Shanker gone, the AFT is likely to lose its special identity. For some time, the AFT has championed policies at odds with the National Education Association, the larger and more left-leaning teachers union; but in recent years, the two unions have held merger talks. One of the big stumbling blocks for Shanker was the NEA's explicit system of racial and sex-based quotas for staff hiring and the election of union officials, which he adamantly opposed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's doubtful that his eventual successor will fight such issues with anything like his passion. Al Shanker's passing marks the end of an era for his union; and all of us who support public education will be the worse for it.</p>\n"}

This time, opponents of race-conscious college admission practices are claiming that Asian Americans are hurt by it. The plaintiffs in Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College, which presented oral arguments before the Supreme Court on Monday, allege that Harvard holds Asian American applicants to higher academic standards and rates them lower than other students on personal characteristics, such as fit, courage and likability. The proposed solution is to abandon race as a factor in admissions decisions.This approach is based on a fundamental misconception. Asian Americans face bias in education, but not in the direction the plaintiffs claim. Research that I and others have done shows that K-12 teachers and schools may actually give Asian Americans a boost based on assumptions about race. Affirmative action policies currently in place in university admissions do not account for the positive bias that Asian Americans may experience before they apply to college. Abandoning race as a consideration in admissions would further obscure this bias.The surge in violence against Asian Americans in the United States since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic is clear evidence that they are the targets of pernicious discrimination. Going back much further than the pandemic, U.S. history is fraught with anti-Asian violence and nativist discrimination, including decades of exclusion from immigration and citizenship that kept the Asian American population at a mere 0.6 percent of the country's total as late as 1960, according to the Pew Research Center.But in an educational context, those biases play out in very unexpected ways. In \"The Asian American Achievement Paradox,\" which I wrote with Min Zhou and is based on 162 interviews of Asian, Hispanic, Black and white adults in Los Angeles, we found that Asian American precollege students benefit from \"stereotype promise\": Teachers assume they are smart, hard-working, high-achieving and morally deserving, which can boost the grades of academically mediocre Asian American students.We found that teachers' positive biases of Asian American students sometimes led them to place even low-achieving Asian American students on competitive academic tracks, including honors and Advanced Placement classes that can be gateways to competitive four-year universities. Once there, we found that these students took their schoolwork more seriously, spent more time on their homework than they had previously and were placed in classes with high-achieving peers, thereby boosting their academic outcomes.A Vietnamese American student I'll call Ophelia (all names have been changed to protect participants' privacy under ethical research guidelines) described herself as \"not very intelligent\" and recalled nearly being held back in second grade because of her poor academic performance. Ophelia had a C average throughout elementary and junior high school, and when she took an exam to be put in Advanced Placement classes for high school English and science, she failed. Ophelia's teachers placed her, with her mother's support, on the AP track anyway. Once there, she said that something \"just clicked,\" and she began to excel in her classes.\"I wanted to work hard and prove I was a good student,\" Ophelia explained. \"I think the competition kind of increases your want to do better.\" She graduated from high school with a grade-point average of 4.2 (exceeding a perfect 4.0) and was admitted into a highly competitive pharmacy program. Ophelia's performance was precisely what her teachers expected, so they did not have to confront the role they may have played in reproducing the stereotype of Asian American exceptionalism.Ophelia's experience is not unique. In our research, we found numerous examples of Asian American students who were anointed as promising by their teachers, even in spite of weak grades and test scores.None of the white, Black or Hispanic adults we interviewed were treated similarly. Hispanic students in particular experience the opposite effect in school, as my work with Estela Diaz shows. The Hispanic students we studied received little encouragement from their teachers to attend college and even less information about how to get in.The sociologist Sean J. Drake drew on two years of ethnographic research in a highly ranked Southern California high school and found a similar positive bias toward Asian American students: \"I don't necessarily look at my classroom and treat a kid differently because they are Asian, but I know that if I have an Asian student in my classroom, I can count on that student. That student will probably work hard and be engaged. I can rely on that kid, and the parents, more so than I can for other groups,\" one teacher told him.Teachers' positive biases toward Asian students affect their assessment of white, Black and Hispanic students, too. The economists Ying Shi and Maria Zhu looked at the standardized test scores of public school students in North Carolina and compared them to teachers' judgments of the same students. In research the economists presented at a National Bureau of Economic Research conference this spring, they found persistent Asian-white disparities in teacher ratings. Teachers are significantly more likely to rate Asian students' skills higher relative to their standardized test scores compared to similarly performing white peers in the same class, even after adjusting for sociodemographic and behavioral measures.Dr. Shi and Dr. Zhu also found that the presence of a single Asian student in a class amplifies teachers' negative assessments of Black and Hispanic students vis-\u00e0-vis white students. Research in education typically focuses on Black-white or Hispanic-white achievement gaps and pays little or no attention to Asian Americans. But these new lines of research show how much more we learn about the ways race affects achievement when we include Asian Americans in our studies. They also show what we get wrong when we exclude them.Asian Americans made up 6 percent of the U.S. population in 2020, and 27.6 percent of Harvard's class of 2026. Students for Fair Admissions argues that number would be even higher if admissions were based on objective, meritocratic metrics, unconstrained by race. But the research my colleagues and I have done shows that some of the metrics that are most commonly cited as objective indicators of academic talent and effort -- things like teachers' assessments and grades -- are subject to bias and woven into the educational system well before students apply to college.Asian American students who have earned admission to Harvard are smart, promising and have no doubt worked very hard. But in ways that are most likely not visible to them, they may have also benefited from their racial status long before they applied. Race-conscious policies provide a mechanism to address this and other biases, and help level the field of opportunity for a diverse student body.Jennifer Lee is a sociology professor at Columbia University and a 2022-23 member of the Institute for Advanced Study.

{"id": "txt/432078693.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Learning From Diversity</h2<p>Jeffrey S. Lehman is the dean of the University of Michigan Law School.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the University of Michigan Law School's admissions policy, in which race is one of the many factors that can influence a decision. The ruling leaves in place a policy that is as cautious a form of affirmative action as one may find in higher education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When 361 students enrolled at our law school this past fall, only 26 were African-American. That is 7 percent of the class in a nation where 13 percent of the citizens are black. A more aggressive affirmative action policy could easily have admitted many more black students, yet our policy led us to reject 70 percent of black applicants. (We rejected a lower percentage of white applicants.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some critics have called our admissions policy insufficiently attentive to the cause of racial justice. They find it shameful that we enroll so few black students and turn away so many. But our policy was not designed to compensate for segregation and discrimination in American society, past or present. It was designed to enroll a group of highly talented students who will, after three years of study, be as well prepared as possible for the modern legal profession. (We pursue other important values as well; our desire to sustain a continuity of identity for the law school leads us to favor Michigan residents and children of alumni.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How does a school enroll a class that will end up as competent as possible at graduation? It is a matter of predictive judgment, not science. We consider each applicant's analytic ability and work ethic as revealed by grades, test scores, work experience, essays and letters of recommendation. Since legal education depends on intense interactions among students and teachers, we also consider what difference an applicant's presence would make to the mix.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Enrolling students who have studied abroad or served as interns on Capitol Hill contributes to lively and sophisticated classroom dialogue. So does enrolling a racially integrated class. And students who learn at integrated campuses are better prepared to succeed in the courthouses and companies of America in 2002.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some critics have argued that our admissions policy should not consider race at all. They contend that in light of the damage done by race consciousness throughout history, the law school should be rigidly colorblind, setting an example that will lead society in that same direction. This suggestion is wishfully utopian, as attractive as the ideal of colorblindness may be. Admissions policies like ours did not create race consciousness, nor are they the linchpin that keeps it in place. Race consciousness is every bit as strong in California and Texas today as it was before affirmative action was banned from their public universities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Our policy follows the guidelines for the appropriate consideration of race in university admissions established by the Supreme Court in the Bakke case 24 years ago. It is both realistic and pragmatic. That is why Secretary of State Colin Powell and former President Gerald Ford have spoken out in support of our admissions policy, as have General Motors, 3M and 30 other major corporations. The court decision maintains a sensible balance. Colorblindness is an ideal, not an idol, and the Constitution does not require us to sacrifice effective education and integration in its name.</p>\n"}

It now says that Federal funds may still flow to colleges and universities that use money from other sources to provide scholarships specifically earmarked for minority students. Just the other day, the department declared that such commingling of money had been illegal since 1964.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The turnaround makes good sense -- such good sense, in fact, that the White House might think again about its policy of refusing Federal funds to agencies that promote family planning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The department's brief press release contained no explanation for the turnaround, just a preamble saying its purpose was \"to prevent disruption to the efforts of colleges and universities to attract minorities to their campuses\" and to reassure current scholarship holders. The previous pronouncement against racially targeted scholarships had produced precisely that effect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The same legal minds that produced yesterday's switch can now face up to the new rule's logical consequences. The U.S. refuses to contribute to the U.N. Fund for Population Assistance because some of its recipients promote abortion. Why not follow a new scenario: First, let the U.N. fund operate freely with money from other sources. Then, let Washington specify that all U.S. money be applied to non-abortion planning activities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The White House argues that any  U.S. funding would constitute impermissible aid to abortionists abroad.

But she doesn't pause when she should. Doesn't question herself when she must.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's a dearth of reflection, a deficit of introspection, and that's not just a generational thing and not just a regional thing, as some of her fans and other observers have begun to assert, unprepared to surrender their image of Paula the Southern Eccentric to the reality of Paula the Deep-Fried Boor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's a judgment thing. A sensitivity thing. It's what happens when your shtick proves as golden as hers and your world is larded with handlers who only say \"yes\" and fans who only say \"more.\" You don't think anybody could possibly see anything untoward in you. So you stop looking for, adjusting to, and correcting the untoward impulses that are in every last one of us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A fresh illustration of this traveled through cyberspace on Monday, a video that shows Deen at The New York Times last October, being interviewed onstage by my colleague Kim Severson. The subject of race comes up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I feel like the South is almost less prejudiced,\" Deen says, \"because black folks played such an integral part in our lives. They were like our family.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That statement alone is awkward -- she's referring to servants, presumably -- but she doesn't stop there. Motioning to the inky backdrop behind her and Severson, she notes that her beloved driver, bodyguard and assistant, Hollis Johnson, is as \"black as that board.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Come out here, Hollis,\" she adds, looking offstage and directing the audience's attention there. \"We can't see you standing against that dark board.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's a lot of apparent focus on skin color, in a vein so breezy it really does make you wonder, especially given what that creepy deposition brought to light last week. She admitted having used \"the n word,\" more than once. She admitted finding beauty in a \"plantation-style wedding\" with an all-black wait staff. From her butter to her banter, she's a Confederate caricature, and a reminder of a past that's still too present.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just how far have we trekked on our long road toward a more colorblind, equitable society? Just how hurtfully do we still stumble? Such questions are prominent this week, with the Supreme Court sidestepping an affirmative-action decision and testimony in the Trayvon Martin case set to begin. We're once again taking stock.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And it's this backdrop that's relevant to Deen's firing by the Food Network and, on Monday, by Smithfield Foods. In a world of pervasive insult and elusive consensus, she provided a discrete opportunity for a line to be drawn. She served up a teachable moment on a platter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's almost always a larger context like that when someone falls as spectacularly as Deen has fallen, and there's almost always a prelude: a first strike.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hers was in early 2012. That's when she lost the benefit of the doubt, not racially but in terms of her character, by revealing that she had been diagnosed three years earlier with Type 2 diabetes, which is abetted by the calorie bombs on which her empire thrived.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This disclosure was timed not to benefit her fans, who were continuing to follow her fatty counsel, but to benefit her: one of her sons had a new healthy-cooking show that needed promoting, and she herself was stepping out as a spokeswoman -- a paid spokeswoman -- for a diabetes drug.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What's more, the triumphant cynicism of this situation seemed lost on her. She beamed as always. Was saucy as ever. You knew then that she had levitated to some altitude where she felt above reproach; that her investment in the bacon-wrapped burlesque of Paula, Inc., trumped a healthy conscience; and that self-examination was a condiment gone from her larder. And it's through the lens of that knowledge that many Americans responded to her deposition and questioned what was in her heart.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Others have urged clemency, noting that she's 66 years old and has lived her life far south of the Mason-Dixon line.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please. All of her adult years postdate the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and she's a citizen of the world, traveling wide and far to peddle her wares. If she can leave Georgia for the sake of commerce, she can leave Georgia in the realm of consciousness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Beyond which, people can change, growing past wrongful ways in the name of what's right. We pass new laws. We adopt new language. That's the recipe for progress: putting justice ahead of habit, principle over precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's not one that's been mastered by Deen, whose worst ingredient isn't corn syrup or Crisco but willful obtuseness.</p>\n"}

(President Kennedy was the first president to acknowledge that civil rights was a \"moral issue.\") This triggered nothing less than a crisis of moral authority that threatened the very legitimacy of American democracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even today, almost 60 years beyond the Civil Rights Act, groups like Black Lives Matter, along with a vast grievance industry, use America's insecure moral authority around race as an opportunity to assert themselves. Doesn't BLM dwell in a space made for it by America's racial self-doubt?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the culture, whites and American institutions are effectively mandated by this confession to prove their innocence of racism as a condition of moral legitimacy. Blacks, in turn, are mandated to honor their new freedom by developing into educational and economic parity with whites. If whites achieve racial innocence and blacks develop into parity with whites, then America will have overcome its original sin. Democracy will have become manifest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This was America's post-confession bargain between the races\u2014innocence on the white hand, development on the black. It defined the old order with which those convention speakers seemed to break. But there is a problem with these mandates: To achieve their ends, they both need blacks to be victims. Whites need blacks they can save to prove their innocence of racism. Blacks must put themselves forward as victims the better to make their case for entitlements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is a corruption because it makes black suffering into a moral power to be wielded, rather than a condition to be overcome. This is the power that blacks discovered in the '60s. It gained us a War on Poverty, affirmative action, school busing, public housing and so on. But it also seduced us into turning our identity into a virtual cult of victimization\u2014as if our persecution was our eternal flame, the deepest truth of who we are, a tragic fate we trade on. After all, in an indifferent world, it may feel better to be the victim of a great historical injustice than a person left out of history when that injustice recedes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet there is an elephant in the room. It is simply that we blacks aren't much victimized any more. Today we are free to build a life that won't be stunted by racial persecution. Today we are far more likely to encounter racial preferences than racial discrimination. Moreover, we live in a society that generally shows us goodwill\u2014a society that has isolated racism as its most unforgivable sin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This lack of victimization amounts to an \"absence of malice\" that profoundly threatens the victim-focused black identity. Who are we without the malice of racism? Can we be black without being victims? The great diminishment (not eradication) of racism since the '60s means that our victim-focused identity has become an anachronism. Well suited for the past, it strains for relevance in the present.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, for many blacks today\u2014especially the young\u2014there is a feeling of inauthenticity, that one is only thinly black because one isn't racially persecuted. \"Systemic racism\" is a term that tries to recover authenticity for a less and less convincing black identity. This racism is really more compensatory than systemic. It was invented to make up for the increasing absence of the real thing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This summer, in cities from Portland, Ore., to Baltimore, black protest seemed driven more by the angst of inauthenticity than by any real menace. The protests themselves came off as theater. There were costumes, masks and well-rehearsed mimes of confrontation and outrage. The violence was destructive, but only to a point. After all it was calibrated to go on for months. In the summer of 2020, self-consciousness replaced spontaneity as the essence of youthful protest in America\u2014yet another sign that there is not enough real victimization to light the sort of fire that burned down Detroit in the '60s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I doubt that any of the black speakers at the RNC would argue that racism has vanished from American life. What makes them harbingers of a new racial order is that they unpair victimization from identity. Victimization may be an experience we endure, but it should never be an identity that defines us. They all spoke as American citizens in a spirit of citizenship.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is the great challenge that always awaits the oppressed after freedom is achieved. If only out of loyalty to our past (all this suffering has to mean something), we will feel compelled to make victimization the centerpiece of our identity today. This will seem the authentic and honorable thing to do. But it will only further invest us in precisely the fruitless tangle of identity and woundedness that mires us in the past. We should never deny the past, but it should only inform and inspire.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the end, only one achievement will turn us from the old victim-focused racial order toward a new, nonracial order: the full and unqualified acceptance of our freedom. We don't have to fight for freedom so much any more. We have to do something more difficult\u2014fully accept that we are free.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Steele, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, is author of \"Shame: How America's Past Sins Have Polarized Our Country\" and writer and narrator of the documentary \"What Killed Michael Brown?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By Shelby Steele</p>\n"}

The resolution goes beyond race to prohibit discrimination based on \"race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability, genetic information, or veteran status.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>UNC's trustees were already trying to move the institution in this direction before the decision. Board member Marty Kotis began advocating a resolution forbidding discrimination in hiring and contracting in 2021. After the Supreme Court ruling, an overwhelming majority of the full board approved a more comprehensive version.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The resolution includes language from Chief Justice John Roberts's majority opinion to specify that \"the University shall not 'establish through application essays or other means' any regime of or encourage heuristics and/or proxies premised upon race-based preferences in hiring or admissions. If the University considers the personal experience of applicants for admission, each applicant 'must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual -- not on the basis of race.'\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"This is a moment of humility,\" said the board's vice chairman, John Preyer. \"For nine years, we've spent in the neighborhood of $35 million to lose a high-profile case. Why did we do that? Was that the right thing to do?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Harvard, UNC's co-litigant, has looked for ways to keep discriminating, and so have many other institutions. They focus on one sentence of the court's ruling: \"Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Harvard responded to the decision by citing this line in isolation, suggesting it would treat it as a loophole. The university said it would comply with the law but reaffirmed its commitment to diversity, commenting, \"we will determine how to preserve, consistent with the Court's new precedent, our essential values.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Other institutions responded similarly, indicating they would follow the law but look for ways to skirt it. Now that applications for fall 2024 are open, it is evident these schools are willing to risk further litigation by using admissions essays to continue to discriminate using race and other identity characteristics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Harvard has made a formerly optional prompt a requirement for all applicants: \"Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a diverse student body. How will the life experiences that shape who you are today enable you to contribute to Harvard?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's hard to read the word \"diverse\" in this prompt as anything other than a signal for students to mention their race or other favored identity characteristics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sarah Lawrence College has a new optional prompt that instructs applicants: \"Drawing upon examples from your life, a quality of your character, and/or a unique ability you possess, describe how you believe your goals for a college education might be impacted, influenced or affected by the Court's decision.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Give the school bonus points for cheekiness, but it surely seems Sarah Lawrence is looking for applicants who fit into favored categories. Nicolaus Mills, a professor of American studies at the college, recently wrote: \"Perhaps we are tempting litigation? But by using the Court's words in an essay prompt, what I think we are really doing is showing we can act according to the letter of the law without being weighed down by the law.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>New essay prompts at Johns Hopkins University and Rice University seem designed to be tested in court. In a required assignment, Johns Hopkins instructs applicants to \"Tell us about an aspect of your identity (eg. race, gender, sexuality, religion, community, etc . . . .) or a life experience that has shaped you as an individual and how that influenced what you'd like to pursue in college at Hopkins.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rice is fishing for the race of applicants with a new optional essay prompt, which asks, \"What perspectives shaped by your background, experiences, upbringing, and/or racial identity inspire you to join our community of change agents at Rice?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even though the court's opinion clearly indicates the focus should be on an individual's resilience and agency, the application processes at some of these institutions are now even more narrowly focused on diversity and identity than before. Some schools have responded to the court's decision by requiring all applicants to talk about diversity, whereas previously it was optional, and by removing opportunities for applicants to talk about other topics that are important to them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stanford University replaced a longstanding prompt -- \"What matters most to you, and why?\" -- with \"Please describe what aspects of your life experiences, interests and character would help you make a distinctive contribution as an undergraduate to Stanford University.\" While it doesn't mention diversity explicitly, it creates such an opening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Schools trying to flout the law are being supported by organizations such as the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, which plans to \"work diligently to identify strategies, to ensure our student populations reflect the broad diversity of our society\" and said it would offer a \"webinar on how to structure a holistic admissions process and other student recruitment strategies that will not violate the new restrictions.\" AACN defiantly states: \"We will not let today's Supreme Court decision stop us from creating a more diverse nursing workforce, which is essential to meeting our nation's healthcare needs.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While institutions have seized on one line in the Supreme Court's majority opinion, they haven't paid as much attention to what immediately follows: \"Despite the dissent's assertion to the contrary, universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It looks as if many colleges and universities will need to be told again, and they will deserve the litigation required to tell them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. McGuire is a fellow at the American Council of Trustees and Alumni.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Johns Hopkins Responds on Admissions Essay\" -- WSJ Aug. 19, 2023)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By Steven McGuire</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/428118535.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Public & Private; Getting In the Door</h2<p>Almost everyone has known a grandfather who was a bootstrapper.  The stories of hard work and personal achievement have a certain sameness: how he delivered newspapers to buy school shoes, how he worked his way through college driving an ice truck, how he started a business even though no one wanted to rent to someone of his ilk. (Pick an ilk. Many ilks. I have heard this story from grandfathers Irish, Polish, German, Italian.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These are inspiring stories that reinforce the notion that the United States is a place where perseverance and hard work can turn a poor person into a rich one. But there is sometimes something mean-spirited at the core of these simple parables. They do not allow for lucky breaks or for the differences between the past and the present. They assume that adversity is somehow ennobling. The stories contain an accusatory moral, a rhetorical question: If I did it, why can't you?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At this moment America's best-known bootstrapper is Clarence Thomas, a man who has moved from the abject poverty of Pinpoint, Ga., to a nomination to the Supreme Court. His public statements on his past have been deeply moving and extraordinarily contradictory; this is a man who once said \"any race-conscious remedy is no good,\" but also said of affirmative action measures, \"But for them, God only knows where I would be today.\" His policies as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and his politics as a black conservative are classic bootstrapper, sure that individual initiative is key and that government aid -- affirmative action, quotas, welfare --is demeaning and ineffective.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Employment is typically based on skills,\" he said in 1982, when he became chairman of the E.E.O.C. \"To become a news reporter, you must be able to write. Simple as that.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Oh, that it were so simple. This is a bootstrapper's belief, that merit is everything: in college admissions, in the job search. But it is human nature that when a hiring partner, a senior editor or a construction foreman looks across the desk at an applicant, one of many things that may play a part is a sense of seeing himself in the other person. That is one reason law firms, newspapers, construction sites are still mainly occupied by white men.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Affirmative action has changed some of that. In every job I have gotten in the last 15 years, my gender has played some part. I was hired and promoted during a period when the corporate world was feeling the heat about diversity, just as Clarence Thomas was hired and promoted when the governmental world was feeling that heat.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Why should we deny or decry that?  The fallacy is that there is some inherent conflict between self-sufficiency and programs that encourage or require participation by competent members of minority groups. The latter open the door; once inside, the challenge is to give value for money, to do the job competently. The risk is that a white man who fails is considered incompetent, while a black man who fails is seen as evidence that blacks cannot do the job.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Several weeks ago, the President stood at Clarence Thomas's side and said that race had played no part in his selection for the Court. Everyone knew that was not true. The question is, does it matter?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It matters to the bootstrappers, who embrace the fiction of color-blindness and who persist in saying that Judge Thomas's race is irrelevant, although he himself once said, \"There is nothing you can do to get past black skin.\" It matters to liberal opponents, who are uncomfortable opposing a black man but cannot support a conservative. And it matters to some supporters, too. \"Given the choice between two conservatives, I'll take the one who's been called 'nigger,' \" the columnist William Raspberry quoted a friend as saying.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don't believe that it matters how you get in the door, only how you perform once you're inside. Thurgood Marshall was chosen by Lyndon Johnson in no small measure because he was African-American. He will always be known as the first black Supreme Court Justice. He will also be known as a great one. Putting those two adjectives in the same place at the same time moves this country forward in its national perceptions. Bootstrappers move it back, to a time when our grandfathers pretended that hard work alone could surmount prejudice for anyone.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/433978930.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Goodbye, Reagan Democrats</h2<p>I'M finished with the Reagan Democrats of Macomb County in suburban Detroit after making a career of spotlighting their middle-class anger and frustrations about race and Democratic politicians. Bill Clinton wrote in his autobiography that my \"extensive research on the so-called Reagan Democrats and what it would take to bring them home\" was the reason he hired me as his pollster for his presidential campaign.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For more than 20 years, the non-college-educated white voters in Macomb County have been considered a \"national political barometer,\" as  Ronald Brownstein of National Journal described them during the Democratic convention in August. After Ronald Reagan won the county by a 2-to-1 margin in 1984, Mr. Brownstein noted, I conducted focus groups that \"found that these working-class whites interpreted Democratic calls for economic fairness as code for transfer payments to African-Americans.\" So what do we think when Barack Obama, an African-American Democrat, wins Macomb County by eight points?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I conducted a survey of 750 Macomb County residents who voted Tuesday, and their responses put their votes in context. Before the Democratic convention, barely 40 percent of Macomb County voters were \"comfortable\" with the idea of Mr. Obama as president, far below the number who were comfortable with a nameless Democrat. But on Election Day, nearly 60 percent said they were \"comfortable\" with Mr. Obama. About the same number said Mr. Obama \"shares your values\" and \"has what it takes to be president.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given Macomb's history, this story helps illustrate America's evolving relationship with race. These voters, like voters elsewhere, watched Mr. Obama intently and became confident he would work for all Americans and be the steady leader the times required.But focusing on the ways that Macomb County has become normal and uninteresting misses the extraordinary changes taking place next door in Oakland County -- a place that played a bigger role in Mr. Obama's success and perhaps in an emerging national Democratic ascendancy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While Macomb County is home to the white middle class that America's auto industry made possible, Oakland County is home to the affluent, business-oriented suburbanites of Birmingham and Bloomfield Hills, some of the richest townships in America. Just a quarter of Macomb County residents have college degrees, but more than 40 percent do in Oakland.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Oakland County has formed part of the Republican heartland in Michigan and the country. From 1972 to 1988, Democratic presidential candidates in their best years lost the county by 20 points. From Bill Clinton to John Kerry, however, Democrats began to settle for a draw. Over the past two decades, Oakland County began to change, as an influx of teachers, lawyers and high-tech professionals began to outnumber the county's business owners and managers. Macomb has been slow to welcome racial diversity, but almost a quarter of Oakland's residents are members of various racial minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These changes have produced a more tolerant and culturally liberal population, uncomfortable with today's Republican Party. When we conducted our poll of 600 voters in Oakland County on election night, they were a lot more open than voters in Macomb to gay marriage and affirmative action. We asked those who voted for Mr. Obama why they made that choice. At the top of the list was his promise to withdraw troops from Iraq, followed by his support for tax cuts for the middle class and affordable health care for all, and the idea that he will bring people together, end the old politics and get things done.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Oakland County voters gave Mr. Obama a 57 percent to 42 percent victory over John McCain -- those 15 points translated into an astonishing 96,000-vote margin. That helped form one of the most important new national changes in the electorate: Mr. Obama built up striking dominance in the country's growing, more diverse and well-educated suburbs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, good riddance, my Macomb barometer. Four years from now, I trust we will see the candidates rush from their conventions to Oakland County, to see the new America.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>STANLEY B.

{"id": "txt/408384755.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Good Teachers Do Make a Difference</h2<p>Ask any American who has enjoyed some measure of success and you'll hear a story about a teacher, perhaps several, who inspired the desire to learn and passed along skills that stuck for life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But a funny thing happens when we move from talking about our own experiences to discussing \"education policy.\" We remember everything except those teachers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is a good news column. It's about how education scholars are discovering not only that teachers matter but that good teachers can ease some of the social problems we spend so much time talking about. One of the most pernicious trends in social policy has been the idea that \"nothing works\" for poor and minority kids, that we should stop \"wasting\" money on problems that have no solutions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The \"nothing works\" view is not only morally suspect but wrong on the facts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yesterday the Education Trust, an organization dedicated to improving teaching for poor kids, released a report based on studies in Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Massachusetts. They found what your grandmother would have told you: Children with smart, well-trained and effective teachers did much better than children with less-qualified teachers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Tennessee study found that \"on average, the least effective teachers produce gains of about 14 percentile points during the school year. By contrast, the most effective teachers posted gains among low achieving students that averaged 53 percentile points.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A Texas study found that teacher quality -- \"measured by education, experience and test scores on initial teacher licensing exams\" -- explained some 43 percent of the variance in student achievement. In Massachusetts, which is going through a searing debate on the difficulties teachers are having in passing basic tests, a study of the Boston public schools found that the top one-third of the teachers are \"producing six times the learning\" compared with the bottom third of teachers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This research could overturn the view that only the occasional charismatic leader can turn around inner-city schools. \"What if these schools are succeeding not on the force of someone's personality but simply by teaching students what they need to know to perform at high levels?\" asks Katy Haycock, the director of the Washington-based Education Trust.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Further hope is offered by Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips in an article, in the new issue of American Prospect, based on their book, \"Black-White Test Score Gap\" (Brookings Institution Press). Jencks reverses an opinion he once held -- that raising the test scores of African American students would do little to improve their earnings relative to whites.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That may have been true in, say, 1964, Jencks says, but it's not true anymore. Among men who scored above the 50th percentile on national tests, black earnings once only two-thirds of those of whites have reached 96 percent of the white average -- near equality. Schooling matters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Jencks and Phillips reach conclusions remarkably similar to those in Haycock's studies. \"The most important resource difference between black and white schools,\" they say, \"seems to be that both black and white teachers in black schools have lower test scores than their counterparts in white schools.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Spending matters, but in more complicated ways than you might expect. School resources, Jencks and Phillips write, are now \"fairly equally distributed between blacks and whites.\" But \"predominantly black schools enroll far more children with severe academic and behavioral problems than white schools do. Such children consume many times more resources than the average child.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This means that \"ordinary black children without special problems are likely to be in larger classes, get less attention and have less academically skilled teachers than similar white children.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The cry now is to end affirmative action in college admissions and return to a \"merit\" system. Supporters of affirmative action argue that ending it has unfairly reduced the number of black students. Here's a challenge to affirmative action foes and supporters alike: Turn some of the energy now going to the affirmative action fight toward improving teaching in schools attended by minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As Jencks and Phillips note: \"If selective colleges could achieve racial diversity without making race an explicit factor in their admissions decisions, blacks would do better in college and whites would nurse fewer political grudges.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Americans value both a fair shake for all and an emphasis on education and achievement. It turns out that bringing the two together may be the most promising road to racial and social justice. Give kids good teachers, and amazing things happen.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398896243.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>'We Are All Racists At Heart'</h2<p>It was once easy to spot a racial bigot: The casual use of the n- word, the sweeping hostility, and the rigid unwillingness to abandon vulgar stereotypes left little doubt that a person harbored prejudice toward blacks as a group. But 50 years of survey research has shown a sharp decline in overt racial prejudice. Instead of being a cause for celebration, however, this trend has set off an ever more strident insistence in academia that whites are pervasively biased.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some psychologists went low-tech: They simply expanded the definition of racism to include any endorsement of politically conservative views grounded in the values of self-reliance and individual responsibility. Opposition to busing, affirmative action or generous welfare programs were tarred as manifestations of \"modern\" or symbolic racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Others took a high-tech path: Racists could be identified by ignoring expressed beliefs and tapping into the workings of the unconscious mind. Thus was born the so-called \"implicit association test.\" The IAT builds on the fact that people react faster to the word \"butter\" if they have just seen the word \"bread\" momentarily flashed on a screen. The quicker response suggests that the mind closely associates those concepts. Applying this technique, researchers such as Mahzarin Banaji of Harvard have found that people recognize \"negative\" words such as \"angry,\" \"criminal\" or \"poor\" more quickly after being momentarily exposed to a black (as opposed to a white) face. And this effect holds up for the vast majority of white respondents -- and sometimes even for majorities of blacks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What do investigators conclude from their findings that \"blackness\" often primes bad associations and \"whiteness\" good ones? According to some, it shows that prejudice permeates our unconscious minds and is not just confined to the 10% of hard-core bigots. Know it or not, we are all vessels of racial bias. From this sweeping conclusion, based on a small if intriguing scientific finding, social scientists, legal scholars, opinion leaders and \"diversity experts\" leap from thought to conduct and from unconscious association to harmful actions. Because most of us are biased, these individuals claim, we can safely assume that every aspect of social life -- every school, institution, organization and workplace -- is a bastion of discrimination. The most strenuous measures, whether they be diversity programs, bureaucratic oversight, accountability or guilt-ridden self-monitoring, cannot guarantee a level playing field.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What is wrong with this picture? In the first place, split-second associations between negative stimuli and minority group images don't necessarily imply unconscious bias. Such associations may merely reflect awareness of common cultural stereotypes. Not everyone who knows the stereotypes necessarily endorses them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Or the associations might reflect simple awareness of the social reality: Some groups are more disadvantaged than others, and more individuals in these groups are likely to behave in undesirable ways. Consider the two Jesses -- Jackson and Helms. Both know that the black family is in trouble, that crime rates in this community are far too high, and that black educational test scores are too low. That common awareness might lead to sympathy, to indifference, or to hostility. Because the IAT can distinguish none of these parameters, both kinds of Jesses often get similar, failing scores on tests of unconscious association.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Measures of unconscious prejudice are especially untrustworthy predictors of discriminatory behavior. MIT psychologist Michael Norton has recently noted that there is virtually no published research showing a systematic link between racist attitudes, overt or subconscious, and real-world discrimination. A few studies show that openly-biased persons sometimes favor whites over blacks in simulations of job hiring and promotion. But no research demonstrates that, after subtracting the influence of residual old-fashioned prejudice, split-second reactions in the laboratory predict real-world decisions. On the contrary, the few results available suggest that persons who are \"high bias\" on subconscious criteria are no more likely than others to treat minorities badly and may sometimes even favor them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is likewise no credible proof that actual business behavior is pervasively influenced by unconscious racial prejudice. This should not be surprising. Demonstrating racial bias is no easy matter because there is often no straightforward way to detect discrimination of any kind, let alone discrimination that is hidden from those doing the deciding. As anyone who has ever tried a job-discrimination case knows, showing that an organization is systematically skewed against members of one group requires a benchmark for how each worker would be treated if race or sex never entered the equation. This in turn depends on defining the standards actually used to judge performance, a task that often requires meticulous data collection and abstruse statistical analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Assuming everyone is biased makes the job easy: The problem of demonstrating actual discrimination goes away and claims of discrimination become irrefutable. Anything short of straight group representation -- equal outcomes rather than equal opportunity -- is \"proof\" that the process is unfair.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Advocates want to have it both ways. On the one hand, any steps taken against discrimination are by definition insufficient, because good intentions and traditional checks on workplace prejudice can never eliminate unconscious bias. On the other, researchers and \"diversity experts\" purport to know what's needed and do not hesitate to recommend more expensive and strenuous measures to purge pervasive racism. There is no more evidence that such efforts dispel supposed unconscious racism than that such racism affects decisions in the first place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But facts have nothing to do with it. What began as science has morphed into unassailable faith. However we think, feel or act, and however much apparent progress has been made, there is no hope for us.

In the brief, he states his belief that diversity can be beneficial in the long term, despite its short-term drawbacks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Our research reveals that even in the short term, diversity is not to blame. We independently analyzed the same data set Professor Putnam used, and we demonstrate that disadvantage, not diversity, is responsible for distrust.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At first glance, our results resemble those of previous studies: People in more diverse communities report lower levels of trust. Scholars and columnists alike have taken this to mean that diversity reduces trust, but we argue that this interpretation is flawed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A thought experiment sheds light on what is going on. Imagine two schools: a homogeneous school with all Dutch students and a diverse school with half Dutch students and half Bolivian students. If we are studying student height, we would most likely find that students in the diverse school are shorter, on average, than students in the homogeneous school. Hardly anyone would then argue that attending a diverse school makes students shorter. Dutch people are taller than Bolivians, on average, and this explains the difference between the schools. Substitute trust for height and communities for schools, and, based on a similar association between diversity and trust, scholars have concluded that living in a diverse community makes people less trusting.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The analogy isn't perfect, but it draws attention to an important possibility: Trust, like height, might be determined by pre-existing differences between groups, rather than exposure to diversity. In the United States, blacks and Latinos report lower levels of trust than whites, regardless of the communities where they live. The average homogeneous community (defined as a census tract) in the United States is 84 percent white, whereas the average diverse community is 54 percent white. Together, these patterns indicate that diverse communities do not make people less trusting. Rather, distrust is higher in diverse communities because blacks and Latinos, who are more likely than whites to live in one, are less trusting to begin with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If diversity doesn't reduce trust, what does? According to our analysis, disadvantage accounts for lower levels of trust. If you have a low income, or less schooling, or are unemployed or experiencing housing instability, you are likely to report lower trust. To make matters worse, if your neighbors experience similar disadvantages, this compounds your distrust. Taken together, this suggests that it is not the diversity of a community that undermines trust, but rather the disadvantages that people in diverse communities face.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is why blacks and Latinos report lower trust than whites: Socioeconomic and neighborhood disadvantages are more common among these groups. We suspect that blacks and Latinos also report lower trust for other reasons, including continuing discrimination, victimization by the police and hostile political rhetoric.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, our only finding related to diversity confirms a familiar story about white intolerance toward minorities. Whites who live among more blacks and Latinos report slightly lower trust than those who live in predominately white communities. This is a far cry from the claim that the minorities who are diversifying the nation are responsible for declining levels of trust.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This distinction has important implications for the affirmative action debate and social policy in general: If diversity is the problem, then policies should aim to protect or even promote homogeneity. If, instead, whites' bias against blacks and Latinos is partly to blame, then policies should aim to allay these biases and their consequences for targeted groups. This was part of President John F. Kennedy's original rationale for affirmative action: to address unequal opportunities across \"race, creed, color.\" Many of the conditions that motivated Kennedy's directive persist today. Blacks, Latinos and members of other disadvantaged groups still face unequal treatment across a range of arenas, from the labor market to housing to education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The current debate on affirmative action is playing out in the context of widespread anxieties about the changing face of the nation. Research that links diversity to negative outcomes legitimizes these anxieties. And it doesn't help that this research has found its way into arguments against affirmative action. But disadvantage and unequal opportunities, rather than diversity, present the biggest obstacles to our getting along. By doing away with affirmative action and limiting access to higher education for blacks and Latinos, we will aggravate the disadvantages these groups face, while accommodating the intolerance of whites toward minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>MARIA ABASCAL and DELIA BALDASSARRI   Maria Abascal is a doctoral candidate in sociology at Princeton and Delia Baldassarri is a professor of sociology at New York University.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Drawing (Drawing by Oscar Bolton Green)</p>\n"}

James Lawson Jr. Day\u201d annually in the city after L.A. County made a similar proclamation, describes him as the \u201cgodfather of the civil rights movement.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Soto-Martinez thinks it\u2019s crucial that more people learn Lawson\u2019s strategies. As he told me, if we\u2019re going to curb the polarization of America, \u201cwe need to see how these tactics are incredibly helpful.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a young man, Lawson spent 13 months in prison for refusing the Korean War draft, then traveled to India to study the practices of Mahatma Gandhi, who had won India\u2019s independence from British rule with nonviolent resistance, or satyagraha. When he came back to the U.S., Lawson met King, who recruited him to train hundreds of civil rights activists in those tactics, preparing them for the lunch counter sit-ins, freedom rides and other protests that led to an end to segregation laws in the South.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1974, six years after King\u2019s assassination, Lawson moved to L.A., where he served as pastor of the Holman United Methodist Church and led training for local labor leaders and activists, including teaching a continuing class at UCLA and at CSU Northridge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Soto-Martinez received his first training from Lawson as a union organizer at 23. A few years later, feeling burnt out and depressed, he questioned his capacity to stay in the struggle. Lawson urged him to dive deeper into the philosophy of nonviolence, suggesting a 1934 book, \u201cThe Power of Nonviolence\u201d by Richard B. Gregg, who also studied Gandhi and influenced King and his allies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cAnger, hatred, and fear make an enormous drain upon our energy,\u201d the book says. \u201cThe angry and violent man puts too much emphasis on immediate objects and too little on the ultimate impelling forces behind them.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Soto-Martinez realized that by acting from a place of love instead of anger, seeing opponents not as enemies to be defeated but as human beings to be won over, he could stay in labor activism his whole life. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about fighting for the sake of fighting, but about what we are trying to build,\u201d Soto-Martinez said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cReverend Lawson is under-appreciated,\u201d said Kent Wong, the UCLA Labor Center director who co-teaches the university\u2019s class on nonviolence with Lawson. He credits Lawson with the \u201crevitalization of the Los Angeles labor movement.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lawson\u2019s teachings have influenced everyone from national civil rights icon John Lewis to undocumented Gen Zers like Karely Amaya, a 23-year-old pursuing a master\u2019s in public policy at UCLA. She co-led Opportunity for All, a recent groundbreaking campaign that convinced the UC Regents to hire undocumented students on UC campuses. Lawson\u2019s class on nonviolence, Amaya told me, made \u201cit possible to see what we could do as undocumented students.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nonviolence education will soon be taught in public schools statewide thanks to a unanimously passed resolution by state Sen. Maria Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), a longtime friend and ally of Lawson\u2019s. The UCLA Labor Center is working on a high school curriculum based on Lawson\u2019s teachings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Durazo was president of the L.A. hotel workers\u2019 union Local 11 when she reached out to Lawson for guidance. He helped her plan protests that brought national attention to the plight of immigrants, including 2003 immigrant freedom rides where 18 buses traveled across the country to respond to rising xenophobia. Two buses were stopped by Border Patrol near El Paso, including one carrying Durazo.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because of training that every participant received from Lawson, they were calm in the face of intimidation by border agents. \u201cNobody ever said, \u2018let me go, I\u2019m a citizen,\u2019\u201d Durazo told me. \u201cWe all stuck together.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nonviolence has lost some of its appeal in recent years, with outrage becoming the norm in public discourse. Civilian militarization and polarization have also caused many activists to see violence as inevitable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The assault on human rights is coming from all directions \u2013 against people of color, women, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community and others. Because the monster now has so many heads, it\u2019s harder to expose the evil than when the villain was segregationist laws in the South.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a single enemy,\u201d said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. \u201cThe enemy is structures of inequality that need to be dismantled. And there\u2019s no strong consensus about how to do that.\u201d Even in deep blue California, well-known solutions to end the legacy of racism such as affirmative action and reparations lack popular support.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But satyagraha is the only sound solution. As the book Lawson suggested to Soto-Martinez states: \u201cPeace imposed by violence is not psychological peace but a suppressed conflict. It is unstable for it contains the seeds of its own destruction.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Karen Hayes, the director of a forthcoming documentary about Lawson\u2019s life, \u201cA Better Way,\u201d says, \u201cA lot of people see nonviolence as only reacting, they see it as passive, when it\u2019s actually radical. And it is disruptive.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Years ago, Lawson cordially asked a white man who had just spat in his face if he could borrow a handkerchief in his pocket. The man was so taken aback that he gave it to him without comment. \u201cIn that moment, Reverend Lawson is saying to that person, \u2018actually, I forgive you for doing that,\u2019\u201d Hayes explained to me. \u201c\u2018I see your humanity. I think enough of you that you will help me.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>She says he preaches that people who act inhumanely do so because they\u2019ve lost sight of their own humanity. In some cases, it\u2019s possible to help them find it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Put into practice, Lawson\u2019s teachings can change us all. Perhaps they even can heal our deep social divides.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>@jeanguerre</p>\n"}

Here's why that myth survives</h2<p>The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on affirmative action, focusing on whether Harvard\u2019s consideration of race in admissions intentionally discriminates against Asian Americans, is expected this month. A big part of our research has been to identify anti-Asian discrimination, so we understand how charges that Asian Americans are held to a higher standard in college admissions might feel like another instance of anti-Asian bias. But we just don\u2019t see an Asian American penalty in college admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Potent myths about admissions circulate within and outside Asian American communities: \u201cAsian Americans have to score higher than other students to get in\u201d and \u201cAsian Americans shouldn\u2019t check the Asian box on applications.\u201d These myths are often endorsed by college admissions advisors and accepted by parents and students, though not a single Asian American student has testified that they faced discrimination in the high profile Harvard case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The faulty evidence for these myths rests in large part on the assumption that tests like the SAT are the best and fairest measures of merit. But the SAT has never been fair and is rooted in racism, developed by a racist eugenicist, Carl Brigham. Standardized test scores are more highly associated with parental education and family income than with college success or completion. Asian Americans have the highest education and incomes of any racial group, though there are significant variations in income and parental education among Asian Americans, with poverty rates among Hmong and Burmese Americans at more than 25%.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Considering factors beyond test scores does not amount to intentional discrimination targeting Asian Americans, but is an important acknowledgment that standardized tests reflect economic inequalities and are flawed indicators of merit. In fact, that is why the University of California no longer considers the SAT in admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, the claim that Asian Americans have to score \u201c140 points\u201d more than white students to get into highly selective colleges has gone viral. Julie J. Park, a scholar of higher education, shows in \u201cRace on Campus: Debunking Myths with Data\u201d why this assertion is wrong. The SAT score differentials often cited are based on a study by Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Radford that, when viewed without context, is quite misleading. Based on data collected in the 1990s, their research does not provide an actual score differential between groups. Why? Because the analysis does not include key elements in admissions files, including letters of recommendation and essays. Espenshade himself has said that the data do not establish racial bias.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the conservative white legal activist Ed Blum is suing Harvard for allegedly penalizing Asian Americans. The complaint is not only on the SAT front, but also that Asian American applicants were subject to racial bias when it comes to Harvard\u2019s \u201cpersonal rating,\u201d one of five ratings that go into an admissions score.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why we don\u2019t buy that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Blum\u2019s suit makes much of the fact that the small numbers of Asian American applications his team reviewed contained comments reinforcing the \u201cmodel minority\u201d stereotype, portraying Asian Americans as passive nerds lacking leadership with phrases like \u201cvery quiet\u201d and \u201cquiet and strong.\u201d But \u201cvery quiet\u201d and \u201cquiet and strong\u201d were comments that appeared in the files of Black, Latino and white applicant files as well. The 2013-14 Harvard Interviewer Handbook highlights \u201cintrospection\u201d and \u201cthe reflective introvert\u201d as a \u201cfuture leader.\u201d Statistical models show positive, though not statistically significant, associations between admissions and Asian American identity for Asian American females and Asian Americans from California. We would expect to see statistically significant negative associations if intentional discrimination was at work here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Asian Americans, like all nonwhite students, do face implicit bias. Importantly, Asian Americans experience both positive and negative forms of bias in college admissions. The stereotype of hard work and smarts can provide an advantage in some instances. But research shows that those who view Asian Americans through that lens are more likely to view other people of color as lacking a work ethic. Indeed, the model minority stereotype has long been used to undermine demands for equality for all.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These troubled dimensions of U.S. race relations are prominently displayed in the Harvard case, in which opportunities are treated as a zero-sum game, divided between a few haves and many have-nots. The lawsuit against Harvard exploits this fear and uses Asian Americans as an argument against affirmative action and against Black, Latino and Indigenous students, rather than drawing attention to the systemic problem of a society that allocates more and more resources to the already advantaged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Harvard, for example, has an endowment of more than $50 billion, and more than half its students come from the top 10 percentile of American society. Of course, the overwhelming majority of students and parents won\u2019t be affected by Harvard\u2019s admissions policy, though the majority will be affected by college debt and underresourced state universities and community colleges. In California, 51% of Asian American college students attend community colleges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is why it\u2019s heartening that the majority of Asian American registered voters surveyed say they favor \u201caffirmative action programs designed to help Black people, women and other minorities get better access to higher education.\u201d Indeed, some studies have shown that Asian American chances of admission to highly selective colleges actually increase when race-conscious policies are in place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In California, the ban on affirmative action at public universities imposed more than 25 years ago had little positive impact for Asian Americans. Asian American and white students may have been marginally more likely to get into their first choice of college versus their second choice after the ban, but overall access to the top tier of UC campuses was unchanged, as were economic outcomes. The ban, however, had major negative impacts on Black and Latino students\u2019 enrollment at the most prestigious campuses, drove down their applications to the UC system overall and dramatically decreased earnings over time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reducing college admissions to a simple and highly biased score overlooks the nuances and complexities of how race and inequality intersect. Affirmative action and race-conscious admissions are limited but necessary tools among many needed to address this intersection. They will not solve the problem of race and inequality by themselves, but without them, that problem will be made worse for all of us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Janelle Wong is the director of Asian American Studies and a professor of American Studies and Government and Politics at the University of Maryland.

After the first incident, in late April, the student who had worn blackface then, Kyler Watkins, wrote in a letter to the Cal Poly student newspaper that \"growing up white and privileged, I was truly unaware of how insensitive I was to the racial implications of blackface.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At first, I was angered and saddened. Then I thought about myself when I was around their age.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was a political activist as a UC Berkeley undergraduate in the early 1990s. A believer in racial solidarity, I would never have worn blackface, or donned a sombrero for Cinco de Mayo, or dressed up as a Mexican gardener for Halloween. When I became co-chair of Berkeley's Asian American Political Alliance, I was undoubtedly full of my supposedly radical self. I was shocked, then, when my fellow co-chair -- a woman -- and every other woman in the organization decided to stage a protest against me and every other man in AAPA for our sexist behavior.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They demanded that we be silent and listen to their allegations against us: taking credit for their work, speaking over them and being unaware of gender and the difference it made in almost everything. They demanded our recognition that the Asian American movement for justice would be hypocritical if it did not also demand justice for Asian American women.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These Asian American feminists did me a favor in confronting me. They did not make me a feminist with one protest, but they altered my view of myself. They gave me a glimpse of how deeply patriarchy and misogyny were ingrained in me. I have never forgotten that lesson, and grappling with the traces of patriarchy and misogyny within me remains an ongoing project.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My time at Berkeley taught me that both education and self-criticism matters when it comes to confronting the things we take to be natural. Sexism feels natural for many men, and even for some women, too. Racism feels natural as well, and not just for white people.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Growing up among Vietnamese people, I heard racism expressed against African Americans and Mexican Americans. The Vietnamese were doing what feels natural to so many immigrants -- becoming American by becoming racist. Even if the Vietnamese might never become white, they could very definitely be not black.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These Vietnamese Americans would probably deny their racism and agree with Watkins when he wrote that his action \"had nothing whatsoever to do with racism or discrimination.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But wearing blackface has everything to do with racism and discrimination, even if the student does not believe himself to be racist. Although I did not believe myself to be sexist as a college student, the effects of my actions were sexist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>More than this, perhaps I did intend to be sexist without even acknowledging it to myself. People with good intentions are often complicit with systems of power that benefit them, including systems of white privilege, male privilege and class privilege. Abusing others feels natural, because in the sexist or racist or classist imagination, the object of the abuse deserves it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was fortunate to attend a university where the undergraduate body was reasonably diverse, and where my fellow students let me know that my behavior was unacceptable. At a university like Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, the least racially diverse California State University campus, the population is 54.8% white. Black students comprise only 0.7% of the student body. Mr. Watkins was deprived -- or deprived himself -- of contact with African American students who might have taught him how offensive blackface is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One function of education is to teach us what our worst instincts are and prevent us from following them. Cal Poly has not done its work to keep white students from acting on their privilege and students of color from feeling unwelcome and misunderstood. And Cal Poly is hardly unique.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Universities and other institutions need to replace good intentions with proactive solutions. Recruit a more diverse student body and faculty. Fund support services and build mentorship networks for students of color, first-generation immigrants, working-class students and every other population that needs this help. And do what a university is supposed to do: Educate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These two Cal Poly students most likely would not have worn blackface had they studied slavery or lynching or segregation. Studying racism and the experiences of people of color in this country should be required in all high schools and universities. I would not be writing these words had I not been an ethnic studies major and the recipient of an affirmative-action fellowship when I went to graduate school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But schools shouldn't stop at issues of race. They should also educate their students about gender and sexuality. For all my racial consciousness, my feminist education began informally, through the intervention of Asian American feminists.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They understood that when education failed, the students have to become the teachers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Viet Thanh Nguyen is a writer and professor of English at USC.

Critical mass is necessary, the school's lawyer argued, to address the racial isolation experienced by minority students and to obtain the full benefits of diversity for all students. But some justices were skeptical. \"How am I supposed to decide,\" Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked, \"whether you have an environment within [which] particular minorities . . . don't feel isolated?\" As the court prepares once again to hear arguments on Fisher's claim this week, African American student protesters on campuses across the nation have been offering a powerful response to Roberts's question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From the University of Missouri, to Lewis and Clark College in Oregon, to the University of Alabama and Ithaca College in upstate New York, African American students have described, for several months and in eloquent detail, the experience of racial isolation on university campuses.

But the claims of marginalization and isolation, and the sustained demands for change, offer a timely window into the precise phenomenon that university officials in Texas sought, in part, to address through the admissions plan they created in 2005.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Under this plan, the university admits 75 percent of its students pursuant to a state law that ensures the admission of every student who graduates in the top 10 percent of a Texas public high school class. Given the stubborn persistence of racial segregation in Texas, some increase in African American and Hispanic students at the university was guaranteed by an admissions plan that drew students from every public high school in the state, but the resulting increases were still insufficient. So the university created a process of holistic review for the remaining 25 percent of applicants that was designed to increase diversity across a wide array of factors and also explicitly to address, in part, the \"glaring racial isolation\" among African American students. The university itself found that 90 percent of the most commonly sized classes included only one or no African American students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These numbers tell only half the story: Black students at the university have also shared their experiences of racial isolation. Some describe being expected to \"represent\" the views of all black people. Other accounts are more explicitly racist. Some students threw a \"border patrol\"-themed party with people dressed up as Mexicans or border patrol agents. Others mockingly held an \"affirmative action\" bake sale, in which white customers were charged more. One of the students at the Black Student Alliance, for which we filed an amicus brief in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin , told us about the time a black student was asked if she was in a classroom to clean it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The University of Texas has rightly defended its efforts to create a more diverse learning environment and pointed out that students of all races derive benefit and learn from people with different backgrounds. And yet challenges to these universally beneficial programs are unceasing. Indeed, Fisher has enjoyed an unusual level of access to the Supreme Court, presenting her affirmative action challenge next week for a second time. In 2013, the court sent the case back to the lower courts, which upheld UT's admissions policy. The university notes that the record in the case does not support Fisher's standing to advance her challenge in the courts: She has graduated from another university and, importantly, would not have been admitted to the University of Texas even in the absence of the current affirmative action plan. There is also another layer of distressing irony in the access afforded Fisher to the court: For more than 30 years, the lower courts have generally refused to allow minority students to participate as full parties in most of the affirmative action challenges to reach the court - thereby inhibiting their ability to testify directly about problems of racial isolation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now African American university students are raising their voices - not in the courtroom, but on campuses nationwide. They are refusing the \"racial closeting\" required by foes of affirmative action, who suggest that minority students should shed their racial identity in the name of a false construct of colorblindness. Instead, they are demanding that their experiences as minority students be recognized and understood by university officials. Their claims, although focused on the classroom environment, curriculum and racial harassment, are deeply connected to the efforts of universities to increase diversity on campuses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Universities may not agree with every demand made by minority student protesters. But they are right to believe that at a minimum, they must build a class of students sufficiently diverse to ameliorate the \"extreme racial isolation\" that Texas students reported in the years before the current admissions plans were adopted, and that students across the country now powerfully describe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The writer is president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.</p>\n"}

Good men and women who challenge liberal policy orthodoxy are vilified, while the civil rights establishment plays defense even for felons if they pass the race test.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>True, liberal interest groups have criticized Sen. Ashcroft for his stands on abortion, the death penalty and gun control. But knowing a great many Americans agree with Sen. Ashcroft on these subjects, they've decided to make race the hot-button issue. Sen. Ashcroft's opposition to both affirmative action and Judge Ronnie White's nomination to the federal bench are cited by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil Liberties Union and other similar organizations as reasons why he should not be confirmed as attorney general.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At this time of collapsing ethics in both society and government, we should be giving the highest priority to moral and spiritual standards when determining an individual's fitness for elected or appointed office. But unfortunately race always trumps character when the political left is handing out its report cards. Public officials who subscribe to their agenda will not only avoid public censure for moral misconduct but in many cases will have their actions defended.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Former Democratic Rep. Gus Savage of Chicago, for example, was found guilty by the House Ethics Committee of sexual misconduct in his thwarted attempts to seduce a young female Peace Corps worker while on an official visit to Africa. He charged that his accusers were racist, and prominent members of the Congressional Black Caucus supported his successful 1990 re-election bid.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rev. Henry Lyons, head of the National Baptist Convention, was found guilty of misappropriating money that was donated to rebuild black churches, yet there was no condemnation by civil rights organizations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And former Rep. Mel Reynolds, convicted of having sex with a 16-year-old campaign worker, said he was the victim of the racism of a politically motivated white prosecutor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In all of these cases the groups that call into question the qualifications of Sen. Ashcroft were either defenders of the miscreants or took a pass at challenging them. In other words, if you hold the correct political views on race you can be a sexual predator, a crook or a pedophile and still receive an A on the civil rights and civil liberties groups' report card.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Members of Congress and the media, meanwhile, have no trouble finding bigotry on the right, but hesitate to challenge bigotry or playing the race card when it is clothed in benevolent intent and perpetrated by so-called civil rights groups and civil libertarians.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most important issue confronting the American public today is to have leaders who are morally and spiritually sound, especially in public offices like that of attorney general. John Ashcroft, no racist, as any fair look at his record shows, passes this test.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Further, we need leadership in promoting solutions to the most pressing problems of our society, such as youth crime and violence, substance abuse, homelessness, and dysfunctional educational systems. Sen. Ashcroft has been the foremost champion of the role of faith-based service providers in addressing these problems through his \"charitable choice\" legislation, which allows states to contract with these organizations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He is an excellent choice for attorney general.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Woodson is president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise in Washington.</p>\n"}

It didn't matter how I comported myself.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--  Henry Louis Gates Jr.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The nation's most famous black scholar was arrested last week breaking into his own home in Cambridge, Mass., after returning from a trip to China and discovering that his key didn't work. Henry Louis Gates Jr. is quite reasonably furious and quite reasonably assumes that it wouldn't have happened if he (and the car-service driver who helped him) were not black. Cambridge police say it wouldn't have happened if Gates had not been \"tumultuous,\" which also may be true, but is neither here nor there. After calming down a bit, Gates responded to being arrested the way any self-respecting Harvard professor would: He informed Charles Ogletree, director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School (\"Call Tree,\" he told his secretary as he was driven off, cuffed), and vowed to make a documentary about unjust arrests.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gates is being painfully reasonable. He says he is glad that a neighbor called the cops when she saw something suspicious going on at his front door, and he hopes she would do so again. He seems surprised that this sort of thing still goes on, which will lose him points in some circles but gain them for him in the credibility department. He is no Al Sharpton, constantly scanning the horizon for his next news conference. (Sharpton has already piped up, presumably uninvited.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gates nobly but unconvincingly frames his anger in nonracial terms: \"How many black and brown men and poor white men are the victims of police officers who are carrying racist thoughts?\" In 2009, there may well be neighborhoods where a couple of white men fiddling with front-door locks are a greater cause for suspicion than a couple of black men. And there may be racist black cops who are too quick to arrest them. But those cases must be even rarer than the race-based arrest of a black Harvard professor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The documentary should be interesting. Gates is a victim of racial profiling, which, if it is anything more than another term for racial discrimination, means leaping to unjustified conclusions about people because of their race. This sounds like something we all can deplore without much reflection, but it's not that easy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, generalizing about people based on characteristics that have no direct connection to the reason you are generalizing is both unavoidable and essential. If the police  --  \"called to the scene,\" as they say  --  find two women of any race seeming to break into a house, they are going to be quicker to believe the story that one of them lives there. They just are. Possibly because it's more likely to be true. I doubt this prejudice can be trained out of them, and at some point you don't want police to be trained to ignore their hard-earned instincts and experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second, generalizations about race don't lead only to bad things, like an unjustified arrest. They can lead to good things, too. The best example is well known around Harvard Square and other academic communities: affirmative action. Part of the rationale for affirmative action is that African Americans are more likely than whites to have struggled harder, under the burden of greater disadvantages, to reach the point where they are poised to enter Harvard. Therefore, they deserve a break. No doubt this is true on average. And no doubt it is false in many cases. You can easily decide that some generalizations are just too toxic to allow, even if true on average, and race might be a good area to start. But you'd be hard-put to justify forbidding racial generalizations in split-second decisions during tense confrontations between citizens and cops, while allowing them in the relatively leisurely precincts of a college admissions office.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Third, Skip Gates did not want to be treated like a citizen of society, no more and no less. He wanted to be treated on the basis of \"how I was dressed\" and \"how I talked\" and \"how I comported myself.\" In short, he wanted to be treated like a Harvard professor. And who can blame him for that? After all, it's a pretty good generalization that someone seen breaking into a house near Harvard Square is less likely to be a burglar if he is also a Harvard professor (and has the ID to prove it, as Gates did).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But how does a Harvard professor dress for his own arrest? A photo taken by a neighbor during the episode and posted on the Web shows Professor Gates, just off the plane from China, definitely underdressed for the occasion in a red polo shirt and dark slacks. At least he wasn't in jeans. In a recent column, George Will denounced jeans as (if I've got this right) a phony effort by folks with no dirt under their nails to show solidarity with the masses. At the time this struck me as overexcited, or at least several decades too late. But maybe Will has a point. As the Chevy Chase police no doubt are aware, one does not break into someone else's house in a tweed sport coat and bow tie.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>kinsleym@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/430508351.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Journal; Angry White Woman</h2<p>Tanya Melich began her Republican political career as a child, passing out leaflets for Wendell Willkie in her hometown of Moab, Utah. At the '92 G.O.P. Convention, she was a Bush delegate from New York. In between she's held almost  every political job she could, short of running for office. \"I cannot remember a time when the Republican Party was not part of my life,\" she writes in the opening sentence of a new book that Bantam is shipping to stores next week. She then goes on to explain just why she has bid the Republican Party goodbye.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The book is titled \"The Republican War Against Women,\" but its contents may be more accurately conveyed by its subtitle: \"An Insider's Report from Behind the Lines.\" Ms. Melich is the first Republican woman to provide a profusely documented, tell-all account of how the far right hijacked her party and then devised what she calls \"a misogynist strategy\" of running against abortion rights, family-planning programs, affirmative action, mothers on welfare and Murphy Brown. As the G.O.P.'s \"Southern strategy\" of the 60's appealed to the white backlash against the civil rights movement, Ms. Melich argues, so its misogynist strategy of the 80's and 90's calculatedly exploited the backlash against feminism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In an interview last week, Ms. Melich said she had written her book because  no one else, either in the G.O.P. or in the press, had told the real story of an inter-Republican sexual war so nasty that even Betty Ford was targeted as an enemy by the party's ascendant right wing. Though Ms. Melich still works as a political consultant in New York -- and was active in the Giuliani campaign -- she has finally lost the \"faith and hope\" that sustained her decades-long effort to bridge the Republican gender gap from within. Her disgust with the Houston Convention and George Bush's wimpy capitulation to its extremist forces led her, like many Republican women, to vote for Bill Clinton in '92.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But she has hardly leapt entirely across the political divide. \"What the hell was he doing setting up another major government bureaucracy with his health-care proposals?\" she asks rhetorically, explaining how the President's \"Great Society approach\" soon halted the assimilation of \"people like me\" into the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Melich's political homelessness has only benefited her as an author, however. She's landed in precisely the cultural battleground -- or, more accurately, no man's land -- where some of this election year's most heated skirmishes will be fought. Contrary to party flacks who downplay the schism, she believes that abortion is \"still the issue that most divides Republicans\" -- and evidence has been accruing in her favor just as her book is published. Even the  modest recent attempts by Bob Dole and The Weekly Standard, the conservative opinion magazine edited by William Kristol, to depart slightly from the G.O.P.'s pro-life stance have led to bitter exchanges between leaders of the party's religious and secular right, with Ralph Reed sniping at Mr. Dole and James Dobson of Focus on the Family attacking William Bennett.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Melich believes accordingly that the real, and perhaps decisive, action among Republicans in '96 will not be during primary season, but \"between April and August\" when Mr. Dole must try to unite a party in which \"the philosophical  contradictions are so enormous\" and anger on all sides runs higher than in '92.  Her own anger derives not just from her party's pro-life zealotry but, more broadly, from its intolerance of those with differing moral or religious values. \"I believe in tolerance for anti-choice Republicans,\" she says. \"You're always going to have different opinions in a democracy. All I'm asking is that extremists don't dominate, because if they dominate, democracy fails, and you have a theocracy or worse.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dismissing the Republican Presidential field as being totally in the pocket of the religious right and regarding Bill Clinton with skepticism, Ms. Melich is left with little alternative but to wish aloud in her book for a dynamic leader  free of both \"Republican bigotry and Democratic wastefulness.\" But who? In the compelling tale of one Republican woman's disenfranchisement, you can hear the predicament of many voters in both parties, men and women alike, as this election year dawns.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/409362863.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Bakke to the Drawing Board</h2<p>The Supreme Court's famous 1978 Bakke opinion on affirmative action never made any sense. The justices announced on Monday that they will rethink it. Bakke held that the Constitution forbids public universities and other government entities to use rigid racial quotas but does not forbid the use of race as one \"factor\" among others. This decision has been popular because it seems like a reasonable enough compromise between the view that reverse racial favoritism is unobjectionable and the view that it is offensive in any form.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Trouble is, the Constitution is not supposed to split the difference. It is supposed to declare basic principles. And as a matter of principle, there is no difference between considering race as a factor and considering race as a quota. University admissions are an all-or-nothing proposition: You're either admitted or you're not. And race either made the difference or it did not. It doesn't matter to the person who loses a place because of affirmative action whether the particular mechanism was an absolute exclusion from some part of the available places or a partial penalty in competing for all the places. Every place that goes to a different person because of race is a quota of one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The refusal of most affirmative-action supporters to acknowledge this unavoidable logical truth -- their naive or cynical embrace of Justice Lewis Powell's wiggy notion in Bakke that quotas are bad but race-as-a-factor is okay because they do it that way at Harvard -- leaves supporters quite rightly scared of what the court might do when it reconsiders the question from scratch.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the other side of the Bakke case has an even bigger logical hole. Alan Bakke was a white applicant for a place at a University of California medical school. Sixteen places out of 100 in the class were reserved for minorities. Bakke had better credentials than most of the black students who were admitted under this quota, and the Supreme Court ruled that he therefore was entitled to a place. Undoubtedly, Alan Bakke would have been admitted if he had been black. But that's not the right question. The right question is whether, as a white person, he would have been admitted to medical school if all those places weren't reserved for blacks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The same question arises in the current case, Grutter v. Bollinger. One of the three plaintiffs, Barbara Grutter, applied to the University of Michigan Law School when she was 43, 18 years after graduating from college with a 3.8 grade point average. With a flurry of statistical studies, Grutter's lawyers proved the obvious - - that blacks have a much easier time getting into the Michigan law school than whites with similar credentials. The school conceded that it aims for 10 to 12 percent of each year's entering class to be from the usual list of minorities. The school says race is just a \"factor\" in admissions policy. Grutter's side says no, it is a \"super factor.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Maybe it's even a \"super-duper factor.\" But it probably did not keep Barbara Grutter out of the Michigan law school. Figures from a representative year included in court documents indicate that the school gets about six applicants for every available place, and that even among those with Grutter's impressive GPA, the chance of getting in is about one in three. Even assuming, implausibly, that every single one of the special-treatment minority students was less qualified than Grutter and would not have been admitted if they were white, that would have improved Grutter's own chances by about one- eighth. The likelihood that affirmative action did her in is very small.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And while we're playing \"what if,\" we should also consider the effect on Grutter's chances if she had found herself competing against blacks and other minorities who had experienced the same variety of advantages and disadvantages as the white candidates in the applicant pool. One anomaly of affirmative action law as it now stands is that courts may allow -- or even require -- reverse discrimination as a \"remedy\" for past discrimination, even as they forbid institutions to practice it voluntarily. The Grutter case could make this anomaly worse by establishing that racial diversity alone is never a good enough reason to favor minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The \"remedy\" loophole applies to past discrimination by a specific institution, not to general discrimination in society. And of course it is impossible to measure the impact of that general discrimination over centuries on particular individuals today. There is no guarantee that any particular beneficiary of affirmative action has had it worse than any particular victim of it, and no reason at all to suppose that Barbara Grutter is responsible for the nation's past and present failures of equal opportunity. But in applying for a place at a highly selective law school, she surely benefited from the special burdens history has put on some of her competitors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And if justice entitles her to the higher chance of admission to the University of Michigan Law School that she would have enjoyed if there were no reverse discrimination, that calculation should also reflect the lower chance she would have had if there were no discrimination of the traditional sort either. Putting all this together makes it even less likely that unfair discrimination kept Grutter out of law school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Affirmative action is a grievance machine. That is probably the worst thing about it. The University of Michigan Law School rejects most people who apply for admission. Only an unidentifiable few are victims of reverse discrimination, but for each one, there are dozens or hundreds who believe they are racial victims or suspect that they may be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A feeling of grievance can be real even when the grievance itself is not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Critics of affirmative action, such as the conservative legal group that engineered the Grutter lawsuit, note accurately that this policy exposes some of the most sensitive nerves in American society. Their concern would be easier to take seriously if they weren't methodically and unjustifiably rubbing those nerves raw.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1909095497.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Why it'so hard for minorities in France to find safe spaces</h2<p>France has long insisted that it had found a wise approach to two volatile topics, race and religion. On race, the government has resisted any special measures to reduce inequality, such as affirmative action, and is barred by law from collecting statistics on race or ethnicity; this is rooted in the acknowledgment that such data were used to round up Jews during the Nazi occupation of France. But critics say the lack of numbers also makes it more difficult to track racial progress -- and racial discrimination -- in a society in which minorities have few high-profile roles. On religion, France has rigidly separated church and state since 1905. More recently, the government has banned the wearing of hijabs and other obvious religious symbols in public schools and face-covering niqabs in public spaces.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>France has stuck to its rigorous rules on color-blindness and secularism even as it has struggled to integrate the millions of Arab and African immigrants who have changed the face of France in the past five decades. By some estimates (since there are no official numbers), 6 million of France's population of 65 million are Muslim and 3 million to 5 million are black (many of them also Muslim). Tensions over refugees, immigration and terrorism helped drive 10 million French voters to cast their ballots for right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen in last month's presidential election. She lost badly to Emmanuel Macron, but the new president has offered few clues as to how he will address the racial and religious conflicts that surface periodically and how he will help give France's minorities a better sense of belonging.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A recent kerfuffle was triggered when Le Pen's right-wing party, National Front, criticized the \"exclusion of white people\" after a black feminist group wanted to reserve some workshops for black women only for a July conference in Paris. There was an immediate political uproar. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo threatened to cancel the conference at a city-owned venue, citing France's laws against racial discrimination. Condemnation of the Nyansapo Festival crossed political lines: SOS Racisme, a leading anti-racist group, and LICRA, which has long fought anti-Semitism, both criticized the organizers, known as the Mwasi Collective. \"Rosa Parks must be spinning in her grave,\" declared Alain Jakubowitz, president of LICRA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Attempts to organize along racial or ethnic lines are viewed with deep suspicion in France and quickly condemned as communitariste or separatist. The organizers explained that the closed sessions were intended to allow attendees to freely discuss issues without being intimidated or restrained by the presence of whites. The argument was similar to the controversial debate in the United States about creating \"safe spaces\" for minority students on college campuses. The French newspaper Le Monde pointed out that the concept of safe spaces has a long history in France, dating back to an abortion rights movement in the 1970s that held women-only meetings. Claude Askolovitch, writing in the French edition of Slate, suggested that Hidalgo would have probably objected to the 1995 Million Man March.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After several days of polemics, Hidalgo announced that a compromise had been reached. The main conference would be held on city property, but the women-only sessions would be hosted at private venues. The Mwasi Collective shrugged off the announcement as what the group had intended all along.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the issue of religion, the city of Nice barred investment firm Noorasur from posting a sign saying that it does \"Islamic Financing.\" Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi, citing the terrorist attack with a truck that killed 86 people last July, said the sign was a \"threat to public order.\" The city argued that the sign could provoke \"antagonistic gatherings\" and threaten the safety of employees of the firm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Islamic financing conforms to sharia by avoiding investing in tobacco, alcohol or pornography, barring interest charges and requiring investors to share both profits and losses. It is widespread in the Middle East -- France's large Muslim population suggests a profitable market in the waiting. In fact, the subject is even taught in some French universities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nice also tried to ban \"burkinis,\" the full-length swimwear worn by some conservative Muslim women. A viral photograph showed policemen forcing a woman on a beach to remove her burkini. The city's argument then was similar to the one about Islamic financing: fear of a violent reaction to Islam because the burkini \"overtly manifests adherence to a religion at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks.\" The ban was overturned by France's Council of State, which called the ordinance a grave violation of personal liberty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In both cases, Nice officials seemed to be saying that being identified as Muslim could trigger violence and is enough of a reason to ban an activity. \"It seems unbelievable to hold people who might be discriminated against responsible for the reactions they might trigger,\" says Rokhaya Diallo, a journalist and activist who has reported extensively on race relations in France. Noorasur has turned to the courts for a judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The recent terrorist attacks in England, France and Germany have once again raised urgent questions about how European countries can better integrate diverse groups into cultures that were much more homogeneous. Battles over safe spaces, burkinis and Islamic investing may seem peripheral to the larger issues, but they reflect a resistance to change that can reinforce a potentially dangerous alienation.</p>\n"}

{"id": "txt/2215680924.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Myth of Male Decline</h2<p>SCROLL through the titles and subtitles of recent books, and you will read that women have become \u201cThe Richer Sex,\u201d that \u201cThe Rise of Women Has Turned Men Into Boys,\u201d and that we may even be seeing \u201cThe End of Men.\u201d Several of the authors of these books posit that we are on the verge of a \u201cnew majority of female breadwinners,\u201d where middle-class wives lord over their husbands while demoralized single men take refuge in perpetual adolescence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How is it, then, that men still control the most important industries, especially technology, occupy most of the positions on the lists of the richest Americans, and continue to make more money than women who have similar skills and education? And why do women make up only 17 percent of Congress?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These books and the cultural anxiety they represent reflect, but exaggerate, a transformation in the distribution of power over the past half-century. Fifty years ago, every male American was entitled to what the sociologist R. W. Connell called a \u201cpatriarchal dividend\u201d \u2014 a lifelong affirmative-action program for men.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The size of that dividend varied according to race and class, but all men could count on women\u2019s being excluded from the most desirable jobs and promotions in their line of work, so the average male high school graduate earned more than the average female college graduate working the same hours. At home, the patriarchal dividend gave husbands the right to decide where the family would live and to make unilateral financial decisions. Male privilege even trumped female consent to sex, so marital rape was not a crime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The curtailment of such male entitlements and the expansion of women\u2019s legal and economic rights have transformed American life, but they have hardly produced a matriarchy. Indeed, in many arenas the progress of women has actually stalled over the past 15 years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s begin by determining which is \u201cthe richer sex.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Women\u2019s real wages have been rising for decades, while the real wages of most men have stagnated or fallen. But women\u2019s wages started from a much lower base, artificially held down by discrimination. Despite their relative improvement, women\u2019s average earnings are still lower than men\u2019s and women remain more likely to be poor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today women make up almost 40 percent of full-time workers in management. But the median wages of female managers are just 73 percent of what male managers earn. And although women have significantly increased their representation among high earners in America over the past half-century, only 4 percent of the C.E.O.\u2019s in Fortune\u2019s top 1,000 companies are female.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What we are seeing is a convergence in economic fortunes, not female ascendance. Between 2010 and 2011, men and women working full time year-round both experienced a 2.5 percent decline in income. Men suffered roughly 80 percent of the job losses at the beginning of the 2007 recession. But the ripple effect of the recession then led to cutbacks in government jobs that hit women disproportionately. As of June 2012, men had regained 46.2 percent of the jobs they lost in the recession, while women had regained 38.7 percent of their lost jobs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The 1970s and 1980s brought an impressive reduction in job segregation by gender, especially in middle-class occupations. But the sociologists David Cotter, Joan Hermsen and Reeve Vanneman report that progress slowed in the 1990s and has all but stopped since 2000. For example, the percentage of female electrical engineers doubled in each decade in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. But in the two decades since 1990 it has increased by only a single percentage point, leaving women at just 10 percent of the total.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some fields have become even more gender-segregated. In 1980, 75 percent of primary school teachers and 64 percent of social workers were women. Today women make up 80 and 81 percent of those fields. Studies show that as occupations gain a higher percentage of female workers, the pay for those jobs goes down relative to wages in similarly skilled jobs that remain bastions of male employment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proponents of the \u201cwomen as the richer sex\u201d scenario often note that in several metropolitan areas, never-married childless women in their 20s now earn more, on average, than their male age-mates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But this is because of the demographic anomaly that such areas have exceptionally large percentages of highly educated single white women and young, poorly educated, low-wage Latino men. Earning more than a man with less education is not the same as earning as much as an equally educated man.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among never-married, childless 22- to 30-year-old metropolitan-area workers with the same educational credentials, males out-earn females in every category, according to a reanalysis of census data to be presented next month at Boston University by Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. Similarly, a 2010 Catalyst survey found that female M.B.A.\u2019s were paid an average of $4,600 less than men in starting salaries and continue to be outpaced by men in rank and salary growth throughout their careers, even if they remain childless.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among married couples when both partners are employed, wives earned an average of 38.5 percent of family income in 2010. In that year nearly 30 percent of working wives out-earned their working husbands, a huge increase from just 4 percent in 1970. But when we include all married-couple families, not just dual-earner ones, the economic clout of wives looks a lot weaker.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In only 20 percent of all married-couple families does the wife earn half or more of all family income, according to Professor Cohen, and in 35 percent of marriages, the wife earns less than 10 percent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once they have children, wives usually fall further behind their husbands in earnings, partly because they are more likely to temporarily quit work or cut back when workplace policies make it hard for both parents to work full time and still meet family obligations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But this also reflects prejudice against working mothers. A few years ago, researchers at Cornell constructed fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, identical in all respects except parental status. They asked college students to evaluate the fitness of candidates for employment or promotion. Mothers were much less likely to be hired. If hired, they were offered, on average, $11,000 less in starting salary and were much less likely to be deemed deserving of promotion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The researchers also submitted similar r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in response to more than 600 actual job advertisements. Applicants identified as childless received twice as many callbacks as the supposed mothers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Much has been made of the gender gap in educational achievement. Girls have long done better in school than boys, and women have now pulled ahead of men in completing college. Today women earn almost 60 percent of college degrees, up from one-third in 1960.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The largest educational gender gap is among families in the top 25 percent of the earnings distribution, where women lead men by 13 percent in graduation rates, compared to just a 2 percent advantage for women from the lowest income families.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But at all income levels, women are still concentrated in traditionally female areas of study. Gender integration of college majors has stalled since the mid-1990s, and in some fields, women have even lost ground. Between 1970 and 1985, women\u2019s share of computer and information sciences degrees rose from 14 percent to 37 percent. But by 2008 women had fallen back to 18 percent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the N.Y.U. sociologist Paula England, a senior fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families, most women, despite earning higher grades, seem to be educating themselves for occupations that systematically pay less.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even women\u2019s greater educational achievement stems partly from continuing gender inequities. Women get a smaller payoff than men for earning a high school degree, but a bigger payoff for completing college. This is not because of their higher grade point averages, the economist Christopher Dougherty concludes, but because women seem to need more education simply to counteract the impact of traditional job discrimination and traditional female career choices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If the ascent of women has been much exaggerated, so has the descent of men. Men\u2019s irresponsibility and bad behavior is now a stock theme in popular culture. But there has always been a subset of men who engage in crude, coercive and exploitative behavior. What\u2019s different today is that it\u2019s harder for men to get away with such behavior in long-term relationships. Women no longer feel compelled to put up with it and the legal system no longer condones it. The result is that many guys who would have been obnoxious husbands, behaving badly behind closed doors, are now obnoxious singles, trumpeting their bad behavior on YouTube.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Their boorishness may be pathetic, but it\u2019s much less destructive than the masculine misbehavior of yore. Most men are in fact behaving better than ever. Domestic violence rates have been halved since 1993, while rapes and sexual assaults against women have fallen by 70 percent in that time. In recent decades, husbands have doubled their share of housework and tripled their share of child care. And this change is not confined to highly educated men.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among dual-earner couples, husbands with the least education do as much or more housework than their more educated counterparts. Men who have made these adjustments report happier marriages \u2014 and better sex lives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ONE thing standing in the way of further progress for many men is the same obstacle that held women back for so long: overinvestment in their gender identity instead of their individual personhood. Men are now experiencing a set of limits \u2014 externally enforced as well as self-imposed \u2014 strikingly similar to the ones Betty Friedan set out to combat in 1963, when she identified a \u201cfeminine mystique\u201d that constrained women\u2019s self-image and options.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although men don\u2019t face the same discriminatory laws as women did 50 years ago, they do face an equally restrictive gender mystique.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just as the feminine mystique discouraged women in the 1950s and 1960s from improving their education or job prospects, on the assumption that a man would always provide for them, the masculine mystique encourages men to neglect their own self-improvement on the assumption that sooner or later their \u201cmanliness\u201d will be rewarded.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to a 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center, 77 percent of Americans now believe that a college education is necessary for a woman to get ahead in life today, but only 68 percent think that is true for men. And just as the feminine mystique exposed girls to ridicule and harassment if they excelled at \u201cunladylike\u201d activities like math or sports, the masculine mystique leads to bullying and ostracism of boys who engage in \u201cgirlie\u201d activities like studying hard and behaving well in school. One result is that men account for only 2 percent of kindergarten and preschool teachers, 3 percent of dental assistants and 9 percent of registered nurses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The masculine mystique is institutionalized in work structures, according to three new studies forthcoming in the Journal of Social Issues. Just as women who display \u201cmasculine\u201d ambitions or behaviors on the job are often penalized, so are men who engage in traditionally female behaviors, like prioritizing family involvement. Men who take an active role in child care and housework at home are more likely than other men to be harassed at work.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Men who request family leave are often viewed as weak or uncompetitive and face a greater risk of being demoted or downsized. And men who have ever quit work for family reasons end up earning significantly less than other male employees, even when controlling for the effects of age, race, education, occupation, seniority and work hours. Now men need to liberate themselves from the pressure to prove their masculinity. Contrary to the fears of some pundits, the ascent of women does not portend the end of men. It offers a new beginning for both. But women\u2019s progress by itself is not a panacea for America\u2019s inequities. The closer we get to achieving equality of opportunity between the sexes, the more clearly we can see that the next major obstacle to improving the well-being of most men and women is the growing socioeconomic inequality within each sex.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stephanie Coontz teaches family history at Evergreen State College and is the author of \u201cA Strange Stirring: The Feminine Mystique and American Women at the Dawn of the 1960s.\u201d</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/422152588.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Shades of Mexican</h2<p>In Kansas, federal officials are investigating an Indian tribe for allegedly selling tribal memberships to illegal immigrants, along with the promise that the documents will protect them from the threat of deportation. By their spokesman's own admission, the Kaweah Indian Nation has sold more than 10,000 memberships for prices starting at $50 and, according to some reports, as much as $1,200.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one level, this is just one of many scams targeting society's most vulnerable consumers. Its success underscores how desperate many undocumented immigrants are to legitimize their status in the United States. On another, it is a powerful contemporary example of historical fact: Mexicans long have used and manipulated race to improve their social status.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unlike in the United States, where race is understood as purely biological, in Mexico it's defined by culture and class as much as it is by DNA. An Indian, for example, is not simply someone with Indian blood, but an individual who behaves, dresses and speaks \"like an Indian.\" Someone of wholly Indian heritage who speaks Spanish and lives according to Hispanic (as opposed to indigenous) customs would be considered mestizo, or mixed. Not surprisingly, when race is a question of culture, it is a fluid and even changeable category.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This isn't to say that race has had no social meaning in Mexican history. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, Spain imposed a hierarchical racial order in colonial Mexico, one that favored those with European heritage and lighter skin. Whites, blacks, mestizos and Indians were assigned different levels of access to property, power and prestige. But through the years, racial mixing eroded the categories and weakened that social order. As the categories loosened, upwardly mobile Mexicans gamed the system and climbed the racial ladder by creative categorization. This was most common on Mexico's northern frontier -- the contemporary American Southwest -- where government control was weak and most pioneers were mestizo. In California and Texas, settlers routinely reclassified themselves to improve their social standing. The first two census surveys of the pueblo of Los Angeles are full of instances of racial re- classification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1781, a certain Jose Vanegas was classified as Indian. Nine years later, however, he is listed as a mestizo. Similarly, while the first census lists Jose Navarro as mestizo, in 1790, he has become a Spaniard instead.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sixty years later, after the U.S. annexed Texas and conquered the Southwest, stricter boundaries went back into effect. Biology and not culture would determine caste and race. In general, the darker a person's skin color and the lower a person's status, the more vulnerable were that individual's rights. To solidify the boundaries, U.S. authorities established anti-miscegenation ordinances to discourage racial mixing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To the extent that Mexican Americans did enjoy legal rights under the new regime, it was because the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican-American War and extended U.S. citizenship to Mexicans in the conquered region, well before blacks, Asians and Native Americans were eligible. They weren't socially \"white,\" but between 1850 and 1920, the U.S. Census counted ethnic Mexicans in the white column.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It makes sense, then, that for much of the 20th century, whenever Mexican Americans were kept out of certain neighborhoods or schools or kept off juries, they employed the \"other white race\" strategy, asserting their rights by arguing that, as whites, they were being unfairly excluded.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>U.S. nativists in the late 1920s and 1930s tried to put a halt to Mexican immigration by having Mexicans (and Mexican Americans) declared non-white, by virtue of their Indian heritage. They based their strategy on a 1924 law that barred entry to immigrants who were ineligible for citizenship, and at that point, only blacks and whites, and not Asians or Native Americans, could naturalize.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The test case came in December 1935, when a Buffalo, N.Y., judge rejected Jalisco-native Timoteo Andrade's application for citizenship on the grounds that he was a \"Mexican Indian.\" Had it not been for the intervention of the Mexican and American governments, who forced a second hearing, this precedent could very well have made most Mexicans, the majority of whom are mestizo, ineligible for citizenship.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the first hearing, Andrade said he was 50% or 75% Indian. At the second hearing, he swore that he had since asked his mother, who assured him that it was probably less than 2%. His citizenship application was approved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the early 1970s, Chicano activists switched from the \"other white race\" to \"the other minority\" strategy as a way to fight discrimination. Just as whiteness once offered the best prospect of protected civil rights, the emergence of race-based policies such as affirmative action and the Voting Rights Act created incentives for them to highlight the nonwhite side of their mixed heritage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Which brings us back to the newest members of the Kaweah Indian Nation. The tribe, which is not federally recognized, says Mexicans can belong because of their clear indigenous ancestry. And it makes sense that the Mexicans putting up the money would be willing to switch racial labels in exchange for a better status in the United States. It's tempting to say that it's a strategy that runs deep in their blood.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/431471009.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>A Glass Half Full</h2<p>Of all the cruelties of apartheid, the most malicious may have been the deliberate denial of educational opportunity to blacks. Their segregated schools taught ''Bantu education,'' by design equipping them only for menial jobs; and the government excluded all but a few from the country's great universities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So it was a powerful symbol of change for me to watch a graduation ceremony the other day at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. It was for students of engineering, regional planning and development, among others; and most of the graduates were black.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like so many things in South Africa, the education story is mixed. Many state schools, especially in rural areas, are desperately under-equipped. Teachers are badly paid. But the state schools in the formerly all-white suburbs, which now have large numbers of black students, are maintaining standards -- and well-off white families are mostly not moving their children to private schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The crucial thing to understand about South Africa is that it has embarked on the second of two immense transitions. The first was political: the change from rule by the white minority to constitutional democracy. The second is economic and social: giving more South Africans an appropriate share of the country's great wealth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The political change went astonishingly well. Prophets of doom were confounded. The new political and legal system is working.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The economic and social challenge is just as daunting. Income distribution is grotesquely unequal. Apartheid's effects linger in a vast class without adequate education. Unemployment is severe. Crime is a serious problem, made to look worse by journalism's focus on horror stories.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But as any visitor can see, the fact is that South Africa is functioning as a sophisticated modern society. During my visit there were headlines about plans of the environment minister, Valli Moosa, to ban four-wheel-drive vehicles from beaches and outlaw the thin plastic bags that litter the countryside.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A skeptical British columnist, Simon Jenkins of The Times, visited a few months ago and wrote: ''Six years ago I would have predicted that, by now, Nelson Mandela's successor would preside over ailing business confidence, a sliding property market and a flight of money. I would have been totally wrong. . . . President Thabo Mbeki has tamed inflation and has a sustained private-sector boom.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>International credit-rating firms recently gave South Africa an investment-grade rating. A bond issue was oversubscribed, by, among others, American pension funds. The Financial Times of London commented: ''Not so long ago, bankers were more familiar with Johannesburg's crime statistics than with South Africa's economy. The enthusiastic response to Pretoria's bond issue shows how much things have changed.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The financial progress is impressive. But it leaves unanswered the question of how to uplift the have-nots: the unemployed and the rural poor who are not in the formal economy at all.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A widespread corporate effort to bring blacks into administrative jobs, backed by a national commitment to affirmative action, is enlarging the black middle class quite rapidly. The danger, though, is that a black elite will still leave the mass of the population underemployed, poor -- and increasingly resentful.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The challenge requires two further steps, I think. One is faster economic growth to create jobs. That necessarily means more foreign investment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other answer is more government action, for example to give land to landless black farm workers and restore land to black communities from which it was seized. The Ministry of Land is supposed to be doing this but has so far not even spent the money it has in its budget.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Uplifting the deprived sectors of society no doubt requires some sacrifice by whites of their economic position, which remains extraordinarily privileged. Many resist the idea. There is still little awareness that greater equality is essential to stability.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whatever the problems, one must not forget what a difference the end of apartheid and its repressive laws has made. A schoolteacher in the town of Germiston, Joseph Tumahole, noted the difficulties of his job. But he said: ''I am free now to say what I want to say. I am free to go where I want to go. I am free to see who I want to see.''</p>\n"}

The Inland Empire has been expanding in population and employment for years as affordable housing has attracted new residents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indeed, you can judge the Inland Empire's present by the fearsome buildup of commuter traffic on freeways linking it with Los Angeles and Orange counties to the west.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the region's changing outlook and its future as one of the most interesting areas of Southern California are news. And you can glimpse that future in the constant building and planning of UC Riverside.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>UCR is building a research park, with wet labs for biotechnology firms and Internet-ready offices for start-ups in information technology, chemistry and other disciplines. One aim is to stop venture capitalists from telling local companies to escape to Orange County or Northern California if they want financing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>UCR's engineering school is leading the way in environmental research on alternative fuels. The university is building a center for entrepreneurial management in Palm Desert. It is starting a law school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>UCR is innovating in education. Its school of education is teaching management courses for principals, administrators and teachers because the average elementary or high school these days is a big business that requires management skills.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>UCR is reaching out. It has more African American and Latino students--the \"underrepresented minorities\"--than any other UC school, even though at 9,550 students it has the smallest enrollment in the UC system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Riverside achieves that distinction because its chancellor, Raymond Orbach, practices affirmative outreach, not affirmative action. Orbach, who has led UCR for eight years, visits high schools in California's Central Valley and the San Gabriel Valley, in East and South Los Angeles, as well as his home territory, to recruit UC- qualifying minority students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"We have a special responsibility to the community,\" says Orbach, a Caltech- and UC Berkeley-trained physicist who grew up in Hollywood.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And, he adds, \"we must train a work force for the modern economy\" of science-based jobs that will characterize the Inland Empire in the decade ahead.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>San Bernardino and Riverside counties, a region larger than five New England states, have an economy based heavily on home and commercial construction and the freight handling and warehousing that go with serving as transfer point for goods from Los Angeles and Long Beach ports bound for the rest of the United States.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That warehousing economy has given the Inland Empire less employment and decidedly lower personal income than those of neighboring Orange County, which has fewer people.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But today many things are changing. Warehousing first of all is becoming more sophisticated, demanding greater computer skills than it used to because of Internet-based inventory controls, says economist John Husing, whose San Bernardino firm Economics & Politics Inc. reports regularly on the Inland Empire's economy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The next decade will see a shift of industry as Ontario Airport expands freight and passenger service and Orange County declines to do so. Businesses wanting to expand in Orange and Los Angeles counties will move to more reasonably priced land and accommodations in Corona, Temecula, Riverside and other cities in the Inland Empire.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's already happening. Timely Technologies, a company providing fiber-optic cables, is moving from Orange County to a site near the UCR campus. \"The firm's 15 owners and employees found that all but one of them already lived in the Inland Empire,\" says Michael Beck, UCR's director of economic development who is overseeing creation of the university's research park.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>UCR itself will be one of the area's fastest-growing institutions, with enrollment rising more than 100% to 19,900 in 2010.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition to environmental research, UCR's College of Engineering has support from Canada's Nortel Networks and Taha Information Systems of India for new studies in information sciences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A $15-million gift from Richard Heckman of Vivendi Water in Palm Desert is launching the UCR business school's entrepreneurial center in the Coachella Valley.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A $5-million gift from Henry Coil Jr., the head of a local construction company, will create a UCR law school. Riverside and San Bernardino counties have only one lawyer for every 898 people, compared with one lawyer for fewer than 300 people in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So UCR will become a greater university--and resource for the region. And it won't be an ivory tower.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Plans eight years ago were to erect a fence around the university, founded in 1907 as a citrus experimental center and commissioned as a college in 1954. But Orbach, who came from the provost's post at UCLA, nixed the fence and spent $1 million of UCR's funds to redevelop a derelict area of abandoned stores adjacent to UCR's campus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today the area is a mini-shopping center with UCR offices and classrooms above its restaurants and coffee shops and a movie theater that serves as lecture hall in the mornings and a cinema evenings and weekends. Half the jobs in the center are reserved for residents of the poor neighborhoods of East Riverside.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"We're not an island,\" Orbach says of the university.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indeed not, it is an economic engine. In other times, heavy- manufacturing plants provided the multiplier effects of jobs and economic development.

As Ariel President John Rogers, one of the few blacks to head a mutual fund advisory firm, put it in a press release: \"After working so hard to join the middle class, many blacks are missing out on the greatest wealth-building opportunity in American history.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The reasons are historical and current; they are cultural and practical. And they contain a message for all investors and mutual fund firms.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, Gloria Acoff, 44, a secretary at Chicago law firm Gardner Carton & Douglas, said, \"My father got into real estate for extra income, but it was never taught to me.,\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No one talked to Acoff about equity investing, either, until about seven years ago. At that time, her employer at another firm, a female lawyer, gave Acoff some material about equity funds offered in the firm's 401(k) retirement plan. \"Her father was heavily into the market,\" Acoff said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The absence of such role models combines with another stark reality for most African-Americans: lack of savings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"It's hard to describe it, but (African-Americans) live from paycheck to paycheck, and whatever money we have extra we're doing something else with it,\" she said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Equity investing in the United States arises from a tradition of inherited wealth owned by the country's economic elites--almost exclusively white Europeans. Until recently, most American households--white as well as black, Hispanic and others--had scant involvement in the stock market.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The cultural estrangement has been especially pronounced for African-Americans. The Ariel/Schwab survey showed that African- Americans generally don't trust institutions that purvey stocks and bonds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What does cultural tradition matter when the Standard & Poor's 500 index is climbing by 30 percent a year? A lot, says Harold Pates, 67, retired president of Kennedy-King College and a stock market investor for nearly 40 years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Despite African-American contributions to American culture for 300 years, many institutions, including Wall Street, remain essentially closed to them, he said. The notion of trading stocks is not foremost in the minds of people whose ancestors a few generations ago were traded like commodities and whose free labor created the profits underlying the equity values of many industries, he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a result, \"the current generation is probably the first generation to have even an academic familiarity with the stock market,\" he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pates, who says an aunt of his was a slave, said reluctance to invest in securities reflects \"the paucity of African-American participation in the stock market culture. We're hardly on the periphery.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For Acoff and many other African-Americans, the workplace--not the family, the church or the school--is the place where an understanding of and participation in securities investing has a chance to blossom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Employers may view tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as 401(k)'s, simply as a convenience and an incentive for employees already motivated to invest in mutual funds. But for many employees, especially minorities, the 401(k) plan is a door to a part of the white culture that they, like their parents, friends and neighbors, have never entered.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Building trust in this process requires of the employer more than a pro forma staff meeting and distribution of mutual fund pamphlets to employees. Most employers are not equipped for the task and are disinclined to engage in a much larger process of affirmative action that nurtures cultural integration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pates and Acoff were lucky. As a child, Pates watched his money grow in a savings account funded from his newspaper route. He started investing in funds through a friend who sold them door-to-door in the early 1960s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Acoff's previous employer and a friend who works for Ariel Mutual Funds put familiar faces into the daunting process of securities investing. Few employees are so fortunate. But many employees share Acoff's primary motivation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I don't know if Social Security is going to be around when I retire, and that has been my concern,\" she said. \"I feel I need to start doing something now.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moreover, many individuals recognize with Acoff the essential benefit of employer-sponsored investment plans: the payroll deduction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I always said to myself, Gloria, when you get paid, pay yourself first, but how many times did I do it?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With regular payroll deductions and monthly electronic withdrawals from her checking account into her Ariel mutual fund account, Acoff, as she puts it, never sees the money.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Don't get me wrong,\" she said. \"I could use the money now, but I know it's good for me (to invest) in the long run.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Despite the assumptions evident in mutual fund advertising, wealth building and saving for retirement are not essential instincts for many Americans, especially lower-income Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The motivation to diversify wealth springs from the culture of inherited wealth and the risks of concentration in a few investments, Pates said. \"You will not find that predicament in the black community,\" he said. \"Even the African-American middle class is one paycheck from financial inconvenience and two paychecks away from poverty.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>African-Americans will invest when they see a welcoming--as well as a helping--hand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dumb question: Why is it that when making an IRA rollover from one mutual fund to another, the check gets lost in the mail for three weeks?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The answer may be to avoid checks and demand electronic transfer of your funds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The weekly \"dumb question\" from readers is answered each Sunday in the belief that there is no such thing as a dumb question when it comes to understanding the financial markets.

{"id": "txt/410316869.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>In Obama, African Americans See Promise of 1776 Fulfilled</h2<p>As the nation prepares to celebrate its first Fourth of July with a black president, I wondered whether African Americans are feeling more patriotic. So I talked with some students in a summer school class at Howard University, one of the country's most time-honored black colleges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was not disappointed. The African American journalism students agreed overwhelmingly that Barack Obama's election has strengthened blacks' enthusiasm for our nation and trust in the democratic ideals we will honor Saturday. (Of course, African Americans, like everybody else, view the holiday primarily as a chance to gobble barbecue, watch fireworks and stalk holiday bargains at the mall, but that's a separate issue.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Obama's victory \"represented the idea that America was changing for the better,\" said Charnese Wilson, 21, a senior from Detroit. \"My peers, that's what they're celebrating, the evolution of America.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The patriotism of African Americans as a group has never been in question. They have fought honorably in the nation's wars and sometimes have suffered disproportionately high casualties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But African Americans tend to love their country more for what it has promised  --  especially on July 4  --  than for what it has delivered. That's hardly surprising, given nearly 21/2 centuries of slavery, followed by another century of segregation and, despite progress, continuing discrimination and disproportionate economic hardship.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sure enough, the Howard students had plenty to say about how hypocrisy has corrupted American ideals. Thomas Jefferson wrote the famous words \"all men are created equal,\" but he was a plantation owner who once said that living without slaves would be an \"inconvenience.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Deontay Morris, 19, a junior from Detroit, expressed contempt for the Founding Fathers because of their \"horrible legacy\" as slaveholders. \"I'm pretty sure George Washington didn't want Barack Obama to be president,\" he said tartly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A moment later, though, Morris praised the Declaration of Independence as \"one of the best documents ever written, because it's evolving over time.\" That's the key to understanding how the Spirit of 1776 has led to a black president whose election adds to African Americans' faith, or at least their hope, that the country will keep its pledges of equality and liberty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the United States was founded, the word \"democracy\" had a negative connotation, because it was associated with mob rule. Only white men with property could vote.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But \"all men are created equal\" has proved powerful over the years. It inspired successful efforts to extend the vote to poor white men during the Age of Jackson in the early 1800s. Lincoln quoted it as he led the country to abolish slavery. Suffragists added \"and women\" when women won the right to vote in 1920. The Declaration animated Martin Luther King Jr. In the movie \"Milk,\" about gay rights activist Harvey Milk, there's a dramatic moment when he tells a crowd, \"All men are created equal. No matter how hard you try, you can never erase those words.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, a black man in the White House is unmistakable evidence of another advance for equality in America. The Howard students, and other African Americans whom I interviewed, recognize and appreciate that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"For the first time, people looked past color and looked at substance\" in the vote, said Kristopher Owens, 20, a junior from Lithonia, Ga.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Obama's election shows that the promise of the United States \"is being realized. We're heading toward that more perfect union,\" said Joe Madison, the well-known black host of a radio talk show based in Washington.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are some outward signs of the change. Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett (D), a black Vietnam veteran, said he had noticed that in the past, about four-fifths of blacks would put their hands over their hearts while standing for \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Recently, though, he said he has observed that it's up to \"virtually 100 percent,\" and he attributes the change to Obama.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Others said they think that African Americans are following the news more closely and are more likely to visit Washington as tourists, because they feel as if they have more at stake in government and politics. African Americans continue to volunteer in larger-than-average numbers for the military, although that reflects economic pressure as well as patriotism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, what should we do so we can celebrate further progress on future Independence Days?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Howard students mentioned the need to improve urban education, to end de facto segregation of institutions such as some high school proms and nursing homes, and to halt gentrification of neighborhoods such as the one around Howard. Their professor, Lawrence Kaggwa, was concerned about Monday's Supreme Court decision favoring white firefighters in New Haven, Conn. It restricts an employer's ability to consider race in personnel decisions, and Kaggwa wanted to ensure that it won't weaken affirmative action and make it harder for his students to get jobs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Asked what African Americans need to do, the students suggested that parents read to their children and use Obama as an example of what can be achieved. \"No longer can we use the homeboy down the street who sells, or [rappers] Tupac [Shakur] and Biggie [Smalls]\" as role models, Owens said. \"The leader of the free world is your standard. You have no excuse.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's an easy way for Obama to contribute to realizing America's democratic dreams. He should speak out forcefully in favor of full voting rights for the District. He supports it, in theory, but has done almost nothing to use his power and prestige to advance the cause. \"All men are created equal\" helped inspire the nation to give political rights to other groups. It's time to do the same for D.C. residents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) has betrayed his commitments to open, transparent government by failing to fully disclose his schedule and travels as Democratic Party chairman.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I'll discuss local issues at 8:51 a.m. tomorrow on WAMU (88.5 FM).

{"id": "txt/2466656215.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>What four California ballot initiatives reveal about race relations in the U.S.</h2<p>In 2020, America's three biggest problems \u2014 according to Americans \u2014 were the coronavirus pandemic, poor political leadership and race relations. Voters expressed their preferences on the first two by throwing President Trump out of the White House.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The election provided little insight on racial issues, however: There is no way to look at Trump's or Joe Biden's vote totals and determine what the public wants on criminal justice, police reform or the many other policy areas where race matters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But we can take some cues from California, where voters were asked to make judgments about a number of questions that touched on race. Their votes yielded a mixed bag of outcomes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>California voters easily defeated Proposition 20, an old-fashioned \"tough on crime\" initiative, which would have enacted stricter parole laws and given prosecutors the option to charge some property crimes, such as \"serial shoplifting,\" as felonies or misdemeanors. Opponents of the measure argued that the state should try to rehabilitate low-level offenders rather than punishing them, and Californians agreed by a 62 percent to 38 percent margin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Voters similarly adopted Proposition 17, which proposed allowing paroled felons to vote. While many convicted felons in America are White, bans on felons voting after serving prison sentences have played a role in suppressing Black votes. Californians voted 59 percent to 41 percent to change their rules, a move that other states may follow in the coming years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The vote on Proposition 16 tells a different story. The initiative would have lifted the state's ban on affirmative action \u2014 allowing the state government to consider race, ethnicity and gender in hiring and contracting decisions, and letting state universities consider those factors in admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The measure failed by a 57 percent to 43 percent margin, suggesting the public remains uncomfortable with measures that use racial preferences to increase diversity in communities. Los Angeles County \u2014 a reliably blue area \u2014 voted \"yes\" by only a two-point margin. In San Francisco County, where only 13 percent voted for Trump, 36 percent opposed the measure. And \"no\" prevailed in every county outside the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proposition 25 showed that, on other issues, the devil is in the details. Prop 25 would have eliminated cash bail and allowed county judges to use an algorithm to assess the risk that someone would fail to appear at their trial. Ending cash bail is goal of progressives in many states, but some civil rights advocates opposed the proposition, arguing that judges and racially biased algorithms would exercise too much power. Ultimately, voters rejected the measure 56 percent to 44 percent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The outcomes suggest there is some appetite for policy changes: The push to expand felon voting rights got 59 percent of the vote, which may mean related reforms are viable in light-blue or even purple states. Moreover, the broad support for reforming parole laws suggests that voters know some old-fashioned sentencing measures need modernizing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But even deep-blue California has its limits. If affirmative action can't regain traction here, it's not clear where it would pass. Moreover, the defeat of affirmative action suggests a majority for more sweeping policies such as \"defunding\" the police may be hard to mobilize elsewhere.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In short, if California is any guide, voters are likely ready for some reforms of out-of-date criminal and sentencing measures. But a majority for broader reforms of America's racial landscape did not emerge from this cycle.</p>\n"}

While such appointments deliver a small measure of prestige and glory, they are thankless, time-consuming public service assignments. For every person you please, you anger twice as many.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was appointed in 1993 and confirmed by the California Senate on a 37-0 vote in 1994. At my confirmation, student leaders hailed me as a \"breath of fresh air.\" Why?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From the outset, I consistently voted to slow the rate of increase in fees and was usually among the first approached by student representatives when issues concerned them. I have voted with student regents more than any other regent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one issue, however, I happen to be out of step with most of the university family, particularly student \"leaders,\" and that is the appropriateness of racial, gender and ethnic preferences. I vehemently oppose such practices and they support them. Because I dare to disagree, they want me to resign.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How quickly the air becomes stale when you disagree with some people.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was not the only regent who voted against racial and gender preferences. So did 14 others. Why am I the only one being singled out for banishment from the hallowed halls of academia? Could it be that my critics fear I might keep looking under the rocks and find other distasteful practices, such as separate graduation ceremonies based on race and ethnicity? Or a confusing, duplicative and wasteful system of \"diversity\" courses that even many faculty members privately question? Or other university-sanctioned practices that divide our students along racial lines and waste precious resources?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because I believe that giving preferences based on race, sex and skin color is a form of discrimination and am asserting my right as a private citizen to express my opposition to such conduct, these students want me gone. This is intellectual conformity at its worst. I have learned the hard way how fickle, intolerant, intellectually lazy and politically naive some of these students can be. They seek to silence their opposition--whom they see as anyone who does not agree with them on every issue--by having them leave the arena of debate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It never ceases to amaze me that many of those who support racial, gender and ethnic preferences proclaim their allegiance to \"diversity,\" but want to deny those who disagree with them their right to assert a different point of view.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I was appointed, I was not informed that I would be required to relinquish my 1st Amendment right of free speech. Nor was I told that I should support the university even when it engaged in conduct that betrayed the Constitution and the deeply held convictions of the people of California.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although this will come as a surprise to many administrators, faculty, staff and students, public universities belong to the people, not to you. We respect your invaluable contribution to our institutions of higher education and acknowledge that without you, they would be without value. But in the final analysis, we, the people, own these institutions and we, the people, will govern them through our duly appointed boards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am not an elected official and I am not running for any office. My first duty as a regent is to the people of California. It is not \"politicizing\" the university when regents catch the academic establishment straying from the values that we the people hold dear and demand that the university bring itself into compliance with our basic values.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Regents swear to uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution and the California Constitution. As I read those documents, racial discrimination is against the law. It is therefore idiotic for anyone to suggest that I have a \"conflict\" when my position as a private citizen is entirely consistent with the policies of the university.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One final comment: On Nov. 5, 1996, the people of California reaffirmed my belief that racial preferences are morally wrong and bad public policy when they adopted by a decisive margin Proposition 209, which reads: \"The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proposition 209 applies to the University of California. I expect the courts to affirm soon that this initiative is the law of our state. I suggest that student leaders get comfortable with the reality that a majority of people in this state support Proposition 209 and the race-neutral principle for which it stands. And I suggest that they get comfortable with regents whose \"personal ambition\" is to attain a society in which no citizens are discriminated against.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Ward Connerly, a Sacramento businessman and chairman of the American Civil Rights Institute, was a sponsor of Proposition 209</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/419366364.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>THE AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION PRESIDENT'S DILEMMA</h2<p>It is common knowledge that President Bush was not much of a student. Although the facts of his lack of academic distinction--at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., Yale University and Harvard Business School--are well known, few people have stopped to ask a seemingly obvious question: How did someone with mediocre grades get admitted to two of this nation's most prestigious universities? With respect to Yale, the answer is plain. George W. Bush was admitted to Yale because his father, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his grandfather, Prescott Bush, were prominent alumni.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Giving preferential treatment to the children of alumni is standard practice at most elite institutions of higher learning. University officials claim these \"legacy admittees\" strengthen their schools by creating continuity across the generations and building a loyal alumni base. This justification parallels the most commonly articulated defense for affirmative action in minority admissions. But Bush and many of his supporters have expressed skepticism--and in the case of U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, outright hostility--for affirmative-action policies for minority students while saying virtually nothing about the affirmative help routinely given to alumni children.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The president's admirers who oppose affirmative action for minorities might try to avoid this uncomfortable analogy by offering a different justification for Yale's decision. During the campaign, those supporting Bush typically chalked up his academic difficulties to youthful indiscretion, emphasizing instead his record in business and as governor of Texas. Judged from the perspective of his post- graduation accomplishments, his defenders implicitly assert, Yale's decision to admit the future president was a wise one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The empirical record, however, belies any attempt to distinguish the two forms of affirmative action on the basis of post-graduation success. The overwhelming majority of minority students who benefit from affirmative action in university admissions also go on to become productive and public-spirited citizens. In the most comprehensive study to date, former university presidents William Bowen and Derrick Bok conclude that black students from selective colleges and universities lead successful and rewarding careers that parallel those of their white classmates. A recent study of the University of Michigan Law School's minority graduates reaches a similar conclusion. Indeed, the post-graduation success of minority students who neither enjoy Bush's ready access to circles of power, nor the automatic assumption of competence that still is attached to those who are white and male, suggests that minorities actually get more out of their education than their white peers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rather than seeking to distinguish affirmative action for legacies from other practices designed to tailor admissions policies to meet university objectives, Bush and his supporters would do better to ask what the success of both kinds of affirmative action says about the predictive value of the \"standard\" criteria used to admit all students. In the Michigan study, for example, researchers found, with only one exception, no statistically significant correlation for any student between undergraduate grades and scores on the Law School Admissions Test and future income or public service. The exception is the inverse correlation between test scores and public service-- the higher a student's LSAT score, the less likely he or she is to engage in significant public service. These findings suggest that law schools and other educational institutions should re-examine their admissions processes for all students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>President Bush claims he wants to \"leave no child behind\" and to \"improve the tone in Washington.\" Minorities might take this effort more seriously if Bush were to acknowledge forthrightly the role that legacy affirmative action has played in his own life. Such candor would go a long way toward persuading minorities that the president really intends to move beyond traditional Republican rhetoric that brands any effort to aid minorities as preferential treatment while ignoring advantages routinely given to those already in positions of power.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Similarly, Bush's pledge to leave no child behind would be more credible if it were accompanied by an explicit promise that the Bush Justice Department will, notwithstanding the views of Atty. Gen. Ashcroft, defend admissions policies that ensure minority students have the same opportunity to succeed as Bush was given when he was admitted to Yale.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Should Bush yield to those on the right and attack affirmative action for minorities while saying nothing about legacy admissions, he will reveal that compassionate conservatism has almost nothing to do with practices that promote diversity and everything to do with policies that protect the children of privilege.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO: President Bush (foreground) hosts his first Cabinet meeting with, from left, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, Secetary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

{"id": "txt/2053180496.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Main Street: An Asian-American Awakening</h2<p>Have progressives poked a sleeping giant? A thousand New Yorkers showed up Sunday at City Hall to protest Mayor Bill de Blasio's bid to substitute de facto racial quotas for a merit-based admission test at the city's elite public schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Two things make the protest striking. First, the protesters were Asian-American. Second, the big local dailies, save for the New York Post, didn't cover it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>New York is not the only place where Asian-Americans are revolting against racial preferences as a tool to help minorities. Four years ago, a backlash by Asian-American lawmakers in California helped defeat a proposed constitutional amendment that would have repealed a state prohibition against considering race in education and other government functions. Meanwhile, a lawsuit accuses Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American applicants in violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"For years Asian-Americans have been viewed as the 'model minority' -- you know, quiet and well-behaved,\" says Chunyan Li, a professor of accounting at New York's Pace University. \"But when we see the effects of social engineering on the future of our children, we can get nasty against the politicians too.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It wasn't supposed to work like this. In theory, only the white patriarchy loses from affirmative action, and all people of color share the same interests, regardless of their history or socioeconomic status or achievement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But affirmative action as practiced today by the American education establishment is blowing a big hole in these assumptions. As Ms. Li notes, many Asian-American families now see that one minority's floor is another's ceiling -- and that the effect of race-based admissions is to set one group against another. It is all the more galling for the signal it sends, which is that if you happen to be the wrong minority, you will be penalized for your hard work and achievement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Certainly this is the implication of Mr. de Blasio's effort to change the admission standards for the city's eight most selective public high schools. At the moment, admission to these schools is determined by the Specialized High School Admissions Test. The progressive dilemma is that the outcomes on this test do not match their desired racial outcome.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Take Stuyvesant, the best-known of New York's specialized schools. Asian students account for 72.9% of the student body, against 2.8% for Latinos and 0.7% for blacks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Asian-American parents -- who aren't always as affluent as the stereotype -- fully understand what this means: Any change that introduces criteria other than merit will mean that qualified Asian applicants will be denied seats in favor of unqualified black and Latino ones. The signs Asian-Americans waved at Sunday's protest reflected this understanding: \"Keep the test,\" \"Excellency is color blind,\" and \"I also have a dream.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As these Asian-Americans were protesting in New York, a lawsuit by a group called Students for Fair Admissions has been working its way through pretrial discovery. The suit accuses Harvard of unlawfully discriminating against Asian-Americans today in the same way the Ivy League once limited the admission of Jews.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The group notes that roughly 20% of applicants Harvard admits are Asian-American today, just as in 1993 -- when the Asian-American population was half what it is now. The higher percentage of Asian-Americans represented at universities that do not use race (e.g., 43% at Caltech) suggests Harvard is deliberately keeping the number low.

Gavin Newsom and replace him are Republicans, but some wear different stripes. There\u2019s a variety to choose from.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The starkest contrast ideologically is between conservative radio talk show host Larry Elder and moderate former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sorry, can\u2019t help you much on the best-known GOP aspirant: Caitlyn Jenner, the Olympic Gold medal-winning decathlete, reality television star and probably the most prominent transgender candidate in American history. She\u2019s a recluse on public policy and has failed to tell us much about what she\u2019d do as governor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re running out of water. I am a big advocate of fire protection, OK?\u201d she answered pesky reporters pressing for specifics at a July 9 news conference, her first of the campaign. Aides stopped the Q&A after 12 minutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Days later, Jenner flew to Australia to compete in a reality TV show.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Back to Elder and Faulconer: One example of how they differ is on racial discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cIt is bull\u2014 that racism remains a major problem in America,\u201d Elder, who would be California\u2019s first Black governor, told me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sure, he said, there used to be racism in employment and housing, \u201cbut not now.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe big problem\u201d for Black communities, Elder continued, \u201cis the absence of fathers in the home.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But what about mistreatment of Black men by white police, as illustrated in the George Floyd killing?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cPolice are more reluctant to pull the trigger on Black people than whites,\u201d he contended.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I asked the 69-year-old syndicated talk show host, who grew up in Los Angeles\u2019 Pico-Union and South Central neighborhoods and became a lawyer, whether he had ever felt racial discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nobody my age who hasn\u2019t felt something. Nothing significant,\u201d Elder replied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The radio commentator has been insisting for many years that America is not systemically racist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By contrast, when Faulconer was mayor, San Diego created a new city department aimed at ending systemic racism and assuring fair distribution of government funds for such things as parks, libraries and contracts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cEstablishing an Office of Race and Equity is an important step forward \u2026 to eliminate the historic inequities and barriers that have existed for so long,\u201d the mayor said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He called on San Diego to \u201chelp our nation acknowledge and act on the systemic racism that has held too many Americans back from their true potential.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Faulconer recently emailed me: \u201cI reject the notion that America is fundamentally racist.\u201d But, he said, \u201cWe have much work to do when it comes to eliminating inequities and barriers.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Racism is a sensitive subject that doesn\u2019t get debated a lot in campaigns for high office. But it\u2019s an important factor when politicians create public policy and divvy up tax dollars. Examples: police funding and use of force, affirmative action in public education and employment, and allocation of school money.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I called Rancho Santa Fe businessman John Cox, another Republican candidate in the Sept. 14 recall election, and asked him how seriously he considers racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cox answered that Black and Latino children living in low-income communities receive second-rate public educations compared with white students whose parents can afford private schooling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cLook at Black and brown communities in California, and they\u2019re behind the eight ball. They\u2019re being given short shrift,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cox added: \u201cI\u2019m an advocate of school choice.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>School choice usually means taxpayer-funded vouchers that parents can spend at private institutions, a concept California voters have previously rejected.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On gun control, Faulconer differs from other candidates. He\u2019s OK with California\u2019s tight restrictions and doesn\u2019t want to weaken or strengthen them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Elder sounds like the National Rifle Assn., contending: \u201cAll they do is tie the hands of law-abiding citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Republican candidate Doug Ose, a former congressman from the Sacramento suburbs, has been urging people to arm themselves for self-protection, noting that the Newsom administration has been releasing state prisoners early.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cox says the state should focus less on banning guns and more on identifying potential killers, treating any mental illnesses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Abortion is no longer a burning issue in California. But a candidate\u2019s position is often a litmus test for voters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Faulconer supports abortion rights, labeling himself pro-choice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Elder believes abortion law should be left up to each state. It was until the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationally. Elder thinks it was a bad decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI believe abortion is murder,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cox told me: \u201cI\u2019m pro-life, but not talking about it. I\u2019d rather talk about water, about electricity. I\u2019m not trying to change the abortion law.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cMy personal story,\u201d Cox continued, \u201cis my mother said she was raped by my real father. She had me and may have aborted me if it were legal [in 1955]. I had the right to life.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On water, all the candidates are for more storage and desalinating. No controversy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bullet train? Derail it, they say.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cPut the dollars into local roads,\u201d Faulconer asserts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Jenner: Use the money to build former President Trump\u2019s border wall.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One caveat in all this: What Elder says may not matter. He waited until the last minute before Friday\u2019s deadline to file official paperwork. So, he didn\u2019t make the secretary of state\u2019s tentative list of candidates that was announced Saturday night.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Elder\u2019s camp said it expects him to be included on the final certified list to be released Wednesday.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If not, it would be worse than Newsom\u2019s team not acting in time to get the governor identified on the recall ballot as a Democrat.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No party has a monopoly on screw-ups.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2831902418.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The affirmative action ruling is big. Now elite colleges need to think bigger.</h2<p>I was sorry but not surprised to see Thursday's Supreme Court decision disallowing affirmative action in college admissions. It is ironic that a court that regards itself as conservative has taken an action so radical in terms of upsetting long-standing practices and expanding federal power over private institutions. Unless universities now respond dramatically and innovatively, the likely result will be degradation of an American university system that is the envy of the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Much of the strength of our university system derives from its pluralism, with fierce competition among institutions large and small, public and private, sectarian and nonsectarian, specialized and liberal-arts oriented, research or teaching focused. It is crucial to allow private institutions to set their own course in admissions and other matters essential to their missions unless bright red lines such as segregation or defrauding students are crossed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Further, as former president Barack Obama's powerful statement this week on his own experience reminds us, admissions policies focused beyond the test scores that dominate in most other countries have allowed private schools to make great contributions to social justice in the United States.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is risk following this week's decision that educational excellence will be set back. To say admissions policies should not be based wholly on test scores is not to say test scores should have no role. If schools take steps such as abolishing testing requirements or emphasizing criteria apart from academic performance to preserve diversity, the result is likely to be a diminishment in how much knowledge they can impart and ultimately a reduction in their contribution to society.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What is done is done, however, and a deep rethinking is now needed. After this earthquake from the court, I hope that elite institutions will broaden their focus from diversifying the racial composition of their ivory towers to additional dimensions of diversity and broadening their commitment to opportunity and social justice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While I supported affirmative action and was heavily involved as university president in writing Harvard's brief in the landmark 2003 affirmative action case Grutter v. Bollinger, I have always been uncomfortable with admissions policies that substantially favor the prep-school-attending minority children of wealthy parents with Ivy League degrees over poor kids from disadvantaged backgrounds with access only to substandard public schools. Years ago, Obama expressed a similar sentiment when he made clear that he did not think that his children should benefit from affirmative action policies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here is the ambitious program that follows from these considerations. First and most straightforward, elite universities should eliminate preferences for legacy applicants, take a hard look at admissions preferences for those who excel in \"aristocrat sports\" and resist being impressed by those who have benefited from high-priced coaching through the admissions process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Elimination of early decision and early admission options would also make the process fairer to applicants from less-sophisticated and -advantaged families.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These steps would open up many admissions slots for which most poor and minority applicants cannot effectively compete at present.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Furthermore, I hope \"holistic\" admissions policies will move to more explicitly consider family disadvantage in selecting applicants. Finding students who have overcome real disadvantage, rather than judging personality, should be central in admissions interviews.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But there are even more promising avenues to pursue. Selective private colleges and universities enroll a tiny fraction of 18-year-olds each year. Changes in their admissions policies will in turn affect only a small fraction of their classes. So for all the attention they attract, the admissions policies of these institutions have a marginal impact on social justice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If elite institutions are serious about social justice, they have to think about scale. What except exclusivity is the rationale for not significantly expanding freshman classes as applicant pools explode?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Beyond that, many leading universities have summer and extension schools. Instead of running summer schools and camps for the children of the privileged, with high tuition and limited financial aid, why not create programs for able disadvantaged kids and motivated and eager public school teachers? Technology makes possible extension courses not just for local education but also for the world and not just for young people but also for students of all ages.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In an earlier era, leading universities were deeply involved with strengthening pre-college education. University faculty created advanced placement courses and, in the post-Sputnik era, a range of science curriculums. With the internet, the capacity of universities to support and supplement high school education is immense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All of us who are part of elite university communities are tremendously fortunate. Indeed, Ivy League endowments have grown dramatically over the past generation. The question for America's elite institutions is this: Will they define their greatness by their exclusivity, while debating who will be the privileged few? Or will they take truly affirmative action, and use their vast resources and great human and social capital to include as many people as possible?</p>\n"}

When you think you're fighting for a less hostile, less confusing and more mutually respectful country for our children to live in and then you find out your idea of a shared purpose wasn't shared by people you like and respect, a real hopelessness sets in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The N-word is filth; it's disrespectful, confusing and uplifts no one. I know of no other minority in the world co-opting a dehumanizing, racial slur used by its oppressor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet I'm told, \"You don't get it; you're white.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No. That doesn't work for me. I deserve a seat at this table. This is about the world my 3-year-old is going to live in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Spending my formative years in a rural part of Hawaii, where welfare and food stamps were how many families in Ewa Beach got by, I grew up as one of a few \"haole\" kids among an ethnic stew of poor- to middle-class Filipino, Samoan, Tongan, Hawaiian and Japanese kids. I would not wish some of the early prejudice and violence I experienced on any prepubescent teen. But in hindsight, I now feel being a minority, even for a few years, should be a prerequisite for every person of a dominant culture; it makes you see and feel what people on the other side see and feel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's where I gained a real affinity and appreciation for diversity, for experiencing the world outside my own ethnic prism. I want to continue that for my son, to impart the one-world values my father imparted on me. I don't want him to experience the word in any form.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I am told, \"This isn't about you,\" I feel like I'm being judged by the color of my skin and not the content of my character.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I understand many black people in this country, including several close friends, feel territorial in having a license to use the word as they see fit. For them, that means diluting its power and origin, the fact that the word was often the last thing a black man heard before he was lynched. I understand most of them mean no malice and actually use it as a term of affection. I've even heard it in locker rooms often the past 25 years covering sports.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I still don't get why it's okay - on any level.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I asked Wilbon to explain his position to me over the phone this past weekend, he said, \"Just know it's so complex. It's like Aloha: It can mean 1,000 different things. My father called me that every day of my life. Every day. To my face. 'Come here, my little [N-word].' \"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Having known Wilbon for 20-plus years and worked with him at The Post for almost 10 years, hearing the word over the phone in such a routine way blew me away. I asked him how that felt, to be called that as a little kid. \"I like the word,\" he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He added that Bill Rhoden, my former colleague at the New York Times, called many of the country's prominent black sports journalists about 20 years ago to ask them to stop using the word in hopes they could help kill it. \"I tried it for about a week,\" he said. \"I couldn't do it. The analogy would be a smoker trying to give up smoking cold turkey. I haven't decided whether I'll call [my son] that. But you know what? I think I will.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But Wilbon also acknowledged, \"Now there's a whole new generation of white people using it. I can see how that can be dangerous.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think it's more than dangerous; I think the casual, callous acceptance of the word by any racial group is downright frightening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Worse, it leads ill-intentioned whites to care even less about people who don't look like them.When that word is deemed acceptable in any situation, here's who gets empowered: those who mock the NFL rule guaranteeing a minority candidate at least be interviewed before a head coaching job is filled, the ones who think affirmative action was always a ruse just to get unqualified minorities jobs, the warped souls who still believe to their core that black activists and white guilt elected President Obama.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition people called late last Friday, inviting me at the last minute to be on a panel encompassing everything from the Washington football team's name to the image of the African American athlete portrayed by the media, I brought up the N-word issue in front of an almost all-black audience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bob Butler, a reporter for KCBS radio in San Francisco and the current president of the National Association of Black Journalists, essentially said that ship has sailed. After the panel, he told me of the frustration of having his teenage son continue using the word on his Facebook account and how that looks for the president of NABJ.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I coach kids about 16, and every time they come off the court, that's what they call each other it seems,\" said Curtis Symonds, the panel's moderator and a former BET executive whom I've known for a while. \"It's so steeped in the culture, you can't even know.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When Suzan Shown Harjo, the Muscogee-Cheyenne woman fighting the name of Daniel Snyder's NFL team in court for the past 20 years, asked the audience at the end to \"please stop using the R-word,\" I couldn't help but feel hollow inside. Really, how in the hell will a room of socially conscious, highly educated African Americans extricate an NFL team name from their vocabulary when Sir Charles, Jay-Z and others in the entertainment industry are telling them the worst thing you can call a black person is all good in the 'hood?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Black people rightly ask white people to examine our prejudices, racism and bigotry, take a hard look at things inside us and around us that we subconsciously might not even recognize. It's an ongoing, everyday effort to meet that challenge, but I've gladly accepted it for my son's future and my own betterment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now I'm asking all my brothers and sisters of every complexion to do something: Take this confusion off the table.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We still live in a very segregated society. Keeping this word around divides us more. Don't write my kid off. Don't make it harder on him just because you have special admission to a club with a sign above it that reads, \"N-words Only.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>mike.wise@washpost.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For more by Mike Wise, visit washingtonpost.com/wise.</p>\n"}

{"id": "txt/2068946767.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>What We Learn From Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings; The questioning of would-be justices isn't just political theater. It often reveals crucial differences in judicial philosophy. What will Brett Kavanaugh reveal?</h2<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Elena Kagan wrote in 1995 that Supreme Court confirmation hearings were a \"vapid and hollow charade.\" That was 15 years before her own confirmation hearing. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the years. (July 13, 2018)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the country prepares for what are likely to be some of the most polarizing Supreme Court confirmation hearings since the nomination of Robert Bork in 1987, the one thing that Republicans and Democrats share is a tendency to dismiss the hearings themselves as a form of political theater devoid of substance--a \"Kabuki dance,\" as then-Senator Joe Biden once put it. In 1995, law professor Elena Kagan, who would be confirmed as a justice 15 years later, neatly summarized this consensus, dismissing all of the post-Bork hearings as a \"vapid and hollow charade.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the consensus isn't entirely accurate. Of course, in every hearing since 1987, Senators have asked gotcha questions and nominees have given evasive answers. But once you cut through the political noise, every one of the hearings has also served an important educational function. Constitutional law can't be reduced to simple politics, and not all judicial conservatives and judicial liberals are the same. For those who have been paying attention, the hearings have revealed the differences among the judicial philosophies of the various nominees with remarkable precision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The end of the Senate filibuster for judicial nominees means that Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination by President Donald Trump can likely be pushed through on a party-line vote. That makes it all the more important to use the coming hearings as a way to educate all Americans, including Judge Kavanaugh's supporters and opponents, about what kind of judicial conservative he would be if confirmed to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For most of American history, Supreme Court hearings rarely focused on judicial philosophy. The first extended public hearings were held in 1916, on the hotly contested nomination of Louis Brandeis who, following custom, refused to testify in person. The first time a nominee testified under oath in fully public hearings was in 1939, when Felix Frankfurter appeared before the Senate to answer charges of disloyalty for his civil libertarian sympathies. The first hearings to focus extensively on a nominee's judicial philosophy were Bork's, when then-Senator Biden declared the right of the Senate to accept or reject the nominee based not on his qualifications but on his approach to interpreting the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Bork hearings set in motion a series of forces that polarized the Supreme Court confirmation process and the country, mobilizing an army of judicial interest groups on both sides. But the hearings were useful in clarifying the difference between the judicial philosophies of Bork and Anthony Kennedy, who was nominated in his wake. Bork insisted that the Constitution should be interpreted in light of the original understanding of its framers and ratifiers, and he argued that judges should refuse to enforce rights that are not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the Senate's rejection of Bork, Anthony Kennedy clearly telegraphed his very different approach when questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"The concept of liberty in the [Constitution's] due process clause is quite expansive, quite sufficient, to protect the values of privacy that Americans legitimately think are part of their constitutional heritage,\" he said, signaling his commitment to uphold the core of the Court's abortion decision in Roe v. Wade.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When asked what standards judges should use to determine which private consensual activities are protected by the Constitution, he replied: \"A very abbreviated list of the considerations are the essentials of the right to human dignity, the injury to the person, the harm to the person, the anguish to the person, the inability of the person to manifest his or her own personality, the inability of a person to obtain his or her own self-fulfillment, the inability of a person to reach his or her own potential.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This statement anticipated his most influential (and controversial) statement as a justice, in his 1992 decision upholding abortion rights: \"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\" It also anticipated the language that he used in his 2015 majority decision upholding the right to same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The 1987 hearings revealed that while Bork embraced a jurisprudence of original meaning, Kennedy was open to invoking the kind of wide-ranging moral reasoning more often favored by judicial liberals. Since then, confirmation hearings have illuminated which method of constitutional interpretation the nominees embrace, and also how much their views are shaped by commitments to precedent and how they see the role of the Court in our constitutional system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1993, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg was nominated, some feminist groups objected to her statement the previous year that Roe v. Wade had been decided too broadly and should have emphasized women's equality rather than the right to privacy. \"Change in our society is incremental,\" she reiterated in her hearings. \"Real change, enduring change, happens one step at a time.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the Court, Justice Ginsburg has focused on incremental changes to existing precedents, just as she promised. In 1996, for example, she persuaded a nearly unanimous Court to enact her view of gender discrimination into law in a case holding that the Virginia Military Institute had to accept female cadets. In doing so, she was able to ratchet up slightly the standard used by the Court for evaluating distinctions based on gender, requiring \"skeptical scrutiny\" of any official action that denied rights or opportunities based on sex.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan have been pragmatists on the Court, as anyone who watched their confirmation hearings would have predicted. In 1994, Senator Orrin Hatch accurately said that then-Judge Breyer embraced \"a pragmatic, nonideological vision of the law.\" In 2010, Senator Chuck Schumer highlighted the fact that then-Solicitor General Kagan had won the respect of her conservative colleagues at Harvard Law School with her \"pragmatism and moderation.\" As she declared during her hearings, in an effort to reach across the aisle, \"In a sense, we are all originalists.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the Court, Justices Breyer and Kagan have often sided with their liberal colleagues, but they also have found common ground with Chief Justice John Roberts and the Court's conservative majority. This past term, in cases striking down a federal ban on sports gambling and upholding a baker's right to refuse to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, they joined 7-2 decisions that were based not on sweeping constitutional principles but on relatively narrow technical grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The liberal justice who stands in clearest opposition to this pragmatic approach is Sonia Sotomayor. As she made clear in her confirmation hearings, she believes fervently that the Constitution protects certain fundamental rights against infringement by the government, from the right to equality to the right to vote. Justice Sotomayor has expressed this view in a series of principled and searing dissents to rulings of the Roberts Court, highlighting the impact of the Trump administration's travel ban on religious minorities and the barriers to racial minorities posed by Ohio's motor-voter law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among the conservatives on the Court, the justice whose philosophy most resembles that of Justices Kagan and Breyer is Chief Justice Roberts, who combines conservative pragmatism with a focus on constitutional structure and the Supreme Court's institutional legitimacy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most illuminating takeaway from then-Judge Roberts's confirmation hearings was his belief that, in order to maintain the nonpartisan legitimacy of the Court, a chief justice should try to persuade his colleagues to reach agreement on narrow opinions and to avoid broad rulings on divisive constitutional disputes. \"The bedrock principle of legitimacy in the American system for courts,\" he said, \"is that any authority to interpret...the Constitution derives from the obligation to decide a particular case or controversy.\" The Court's basic role, he believes, is to resolve the disputes that come to it, not to set out far-reaching and contested general principles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When asked how he would avoid 5-4 decisions along partisan lines, Judge Roberts said, \"I do think it should be a priority to have an opinion of the court [as a whole].... You don't, obviously, compromise strongly held views, but you do have to be open to the considered views of your colleagues.\" His concern with the Court's institutional legitimacy informed his historic--and pragmatic--vote to uphold on narrow grounds President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In other cases, Chief Justice Roberts has convinced his colleagues to reach a consensus by deciding cases on narrow grounds. A unanimous decision early in his tenure upheld a law that withheld federal funds from universities for banning military recruitment on campus. In more recent cases, on issues ranging from partisan gerrymandering to affirmative action, the Court under his leadership has managed to produce rulings that avoided the most far-reaching claims made by the contending parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If Chief Justice Roberts has emphasized consensus, Justice Clarence Thomas has shown himself to be a principled originalist, as he clearly signaled he would be in his confirmation hearings. Over the years, he has written a series of bold concurrences and dissents setting out his views of the legitimate, original understanding of the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a 1995 case, for example, he suggested that the founding generation would have questioned the constitutionality of the post-New Deal administrative state. And in the Court's recent ruling to allow the Trump administration's travel ban, he wrote a concurrence saying that the original understanding of the Constitution did not include the issuing of nationwide injunctions by district courts--the tactic favored by opponents of the ban.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for the newest justice, Neil Gorsuch, he also emphasized his credentials as an originalist in his confirmation hearings, though he added, \"I'm not looking to take us back to quill pens and horses and buggy.\" He repeatedly cited a 2012 Supreme Court case in which the justices held that the police could not attach a GPS tracking device to a car and follow a suspect for a month. As he put it, \"The Court held that if that's a trespass to chattels and a search 200 years ago, it has to be today, though the technology is obviously different.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He further developed this approach in his dissent last month in a case concerning digital privacy rights. Chief Justice Roberts and the four liberal justices held that the police couldn't seize more than five months of a suspect's historical cellphone data without a warrant, because most people don't expect to be ubiquitously tracked in public. Justice Gorsuch didn't accept their reasoning, but he suggested that he would have been sympathetic to the defendant if he had instead based his argument on a claim of property rights in his cellphone data--a claim more grounded, in Justice Gorsuch's view, in the Constitution's original meaning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Judge Brett Kavanaugh's hearings in the fall are yet another opportunity to educate the public about the judicial philosophy of a nominee. When President Donald Trump nominated him, the judge declared, \"My judicial philosophy is straightforward.\" As he put it, \"A judge must interpret statutes as written. And a judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's striking that Judge Kavanaugh did not call himself an originalist, and his opinions on the appellate court suggest that he uses less originalist analysis than Justice Thomas or Justice Gorsuch. Instead, Judge Kavanaugh appears to focus on constitutional structure, to ensure that the executive branch and Congress operate within their specified boundaries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A central focus of the confirmation hearings will be on Judge Kavanaugh's views about the weight of existing precedent, since the Court may have the opportunity to overturn not only Roe v. Wade but a series of cases in which Justice Kennedy voted with the liberal justices, ranging from same-sex marriage to affirmative action and the death penalty. Although Judge Kavanaugh, like all nominees, pays the obligatory respect to the importance of precedent, it's worth delving into whether he is willing to overturn precedents that have been repeatedly reaffirmed by justices appointed by presidents of both political parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The former judge Michael Luttig, whom President George W. Bush considered for the Supreme Court, has called these \"super precedents,\" suggesting that even justices who disagree with Roe v. Wade, for example, should consider affirming it because it has become so deeply embedded in the fabric of American law. Does Judge Kavanaugh, like Chief Justice Roberts, consider the institutional legitimacy of the Court to be an important consideration in constitutional interpretation?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By using the Kavanaugh hearings as an opportunity for constitutional education, the Senate Judiciary Committee can perform a real service to the country. The hearings can help citizens to understand that constitutional law cannot be reduced to a series of political questions pitting Republicans against Democrats. Instead, it aspires to be a legal enterprise in which people of good faith can disagree based on constitutional methodologies rather than on political ideologies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The confirmation hearings are an opportunity for all of us to learn about the range of approaches to interpreting the Constitution. However inflamed the politics become, citizens can use the hearings to educate themselves about how liberal and conservative justices, at their best, reason together about American history and fundamental law. Here's a chance, above all, for Americans to decide which approach they find most persuasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Rosen is the president and chief executive officer of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia and a law professor at George Washington University.

{"id": "txt/2625418392.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>How Stephen Breyer could end his tenure with a surprise</h2<p>After a distinguished 27-year career, Justice Stephen G. Breyer's final months on the Supreme Court will include a half-dozen cases of major consequence. The question is: How will he choose to go out \u2014 a respected dissenter, or something more?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Breyer's record answers much of this question. He will almost certainly dissent in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, the case that aims to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Could Breyer surprise on the two critical religious liberty cases pending before the court ahead of his exit? He has never been a champion of the free exercise clause \u2014 the \"first freedom\" in the First Amendment. But he's an observant fellow of the culture around him and his books have shown support for a civil society tolerant of disagreement. He can see the dominant culture of elites restricting people of faith, including an assistant football coach in Washington state fired for praying with his players (Kennedy v. Bremerton School District), and Maine's voucher program excluding religious schools even in remote areas of the state where no public high school can be found (Carson v. Makin). Both matters will be decided by the court soon. Perhaps Breyer will take a deep breath and decide that, after all, this society was supposed to be welcoming to all faiths and protective of all faith traditions especially as against the state.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But probably not. Three dissents then. It would have almost certainly been four had the court not punted affirmative action (Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College) to the fall. \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race,\" Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in 2007\u2032s Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, \"is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" The chief is likely to have at least five other votes for the long overdue end to the use of race by the state in any way and at any level to award benefits or inflict penalties. Breyer broke with Roberts in 2007 on the question. It's hard to see how views on such a fundamental issue have changed much in the subsequent 15 years, but the calendar means Breyer will miss one last plea for affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So will Justice Breyer go out with even a single, significant majority opinion? It is possible, but only if he \u2014 and his originalist colleagues \u2014 recognize the need for some clarity on the Second Amendment in 2022. What if Breyer authors the majority opinion in the Second Amendment case before the court: New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This would be a clear departure from Breyer's dissent in the 2008 Heller decision \u2014 the milestone ruling that the Constitution protects an individual's right to bear arms. At that time, Breyer wrote that \"Neither the text of the Amendment nor the arguments advanced by its proponents evidenced the slightest interest in limit\u00ading any legislature's authority to regulate private civilian uses of firearms.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Specifically,\" Breyer continued, \"there is no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Breyer lost in 2008. Could he now choose to accept the reality of the new court expanding on what the more closely divided court decided back then? Could he indeed offer to write the majority opinion, and replace the outdated \"standards of review\" for gun laws (strict scrutiny vs. intermediate scrutiny vs. \"rational basis\") with some sort of reasonable rule, devised by Breyer, that articulates a test for the constitutionality of gun control laws in a way that the vast majority of gun owners see as not only reasonable, but compelling?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This new \"Breyer rule\" would be a boon to Second Amendment advocates \u2014 creating some consensus on the court and a usable framework for what is indisputably a constitutional right continually under attack by means other than a constitutional amendment. At the same time, it would also be a balm to gun-control advocates to realize that a rule exists that would uphold bans on machine guns in private hands and some limits \u2014 reasonable \"red-flag\" laws, for example. The new standard would surround the Second Amendment with some court consensus on its reach, a \"Breyer rule\" that his conservative colleagues could agree would not have offended the Framers a bit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yes, Justice Breyer could close his last term 0-6, and still be esteemed by his colleagues for his temperament and first-rate mind. But what if he reaches for more? What if he wants to try to settle the Second Amendment's scope with a rule that protects the right to keep and bear arms but also the need for the government to assert the protection of the public that is inherent in the ban on machine guns and tanks in private hands? Breyer's intellect is up to the task. Perhaps he is willing to put his reputation as a stalwart liberal on the line to settle a long-running argument that would best be resolved by clarity.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/408372429.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Rocky Road to Equality</h2<p>Watching yet another dialogue on race with Bill Clinton on the Public Broadcasting System, I was startled when two of the participants tried to speak unsparing truth to presidential power.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Elaine Chao, former head of United Way and now with the Heritage Foundation, told of a single mother in San Francisco whose son was applying to a high school in the Unified San Francisco School System. It has a quota system implemented through a court's consent decree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The youngster had a high test score but was rejected, Chao reported, \"because there were too many Chinese Americans\" already in the school. The Chinese quota was filled -- in a public school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To achieve diversity, the school, she notes, has different standards for different students of different colors. \"If you are Asian American, you have the toughest standard\" to meet for admission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"That is a horrible example,\" she said, \"of preferential treatment and of unfair treatment based on race.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The president, who had earlier given his customary ode to diversity, showed no indignation at the discrimination Chao cited. And columnist Clarence Page jumped in to lecture her. He urged Chao to keep in mind \"the pain we want to pay\" to achieve \"the dream of integration.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Page put the equation more honestly, from his point of view, than most supporters of affirmative action. They, like Jesse Jackson, talk of \"sharing\" pain and not about inflicting pain on specific other people.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Page laid it out: \"How much equal opportunity are you willing to sacrifice in pursuit of diversity? . . . If you want the virtue of having your kids exposed to other kids of different races and backgrounds, then you got to be willing to say we got to put a ceiling on some people.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Black children indeed have been denied equal opportunity from the beginning of the republic, and they have suffered. But who is to decide that pain must be inflicted on this qualified Chinese kid? And under what definition of fundamental fairness is he to be designated for punishment -- only because he is Chinese?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Is this new discrimination the only route to diversity?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Along with Chao, another important contributor to the dialogue was Richard Rodriguez of the Pacific News Service. He brought up a subject that rarely surfaces in discussions of affirmative action:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The language of affirmative action is . . . that poor white males . . . are somehow represented in the public society. Like hell they are. Where are the Appalachian whites represented?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He also underlined, as a \"middle-class Mexican American,\" how complex racial identifications are: \"My father is very light skinned, my mother looks very Indian. There are white Hispanics, there are black Hispanics. If we are going to discuss race in America with bureaucratic understandings of who is a Hispanic -- without even knowing what a Hispanic means -- we are in real trouble in this country.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The president kept coming back to affirmative action in college admissions. He asked Richard Rodriguez what he would do if he were president of a university. Wouldn't he want a \"racially diverse\" faculty and student body?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rodriguez would not play that game. \"I think,\" he said, \"you would start at the bottom of the social ladder. You would start in first grade rather than at graduate school to decide which ones of us get into law school. You would make sure America has a system of education that saved children in the first grade because we lose them there.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Chao made a point that goes beyond affirmative action: \"Equal opportunity must exist for everyone in this country regardless of color, race or creed. When we do not offer opportunity based on merit, that leads to \"differential treatment, preferential treatment, with one group versus another,\" she said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not mentioned in the discussion was a point made in the Wall Street Journal by linguistics Prof. John McWhorter of the University of California at Berkeley: \"Affirmative action at Berkeley primarily benefited middle class students -- not the disadvantaged the program aimed to aid.\" As Rodriguez says, the place to start is the first grade.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2831916113.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Here's how to move forward without affirmative action; It will be critical to retain minority students. That means increasing diversity among the faculty.</h2<p>The Supreme Court's reversal of a long line of decisions supporting affirmative action in higher education signals a deep-seated denial that inequality continues to be perpetuated by America's educational system. The decision on Thursday ignores that people have been discriminated against when accessing education and that many have suffered from an unequal socioeconomic system in which higher education attainment can be a ladder to a better life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, inclusion in higher education -- which can lead to inclusion in white-collar professions and leadership positions in society -- is more complex than simply enrolling a diverse student body. It's also important to keep students on track once they've been admitted, making sure they learn, bond, feel that they belong and ultimately graduate. That's one reason to diversify the top ranks of faculty. The court's decision means that fewer ethnic and racial minority students will be admitted, making it even more important that institutions support those who are enrolled, ensuring that attrition is as low as possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In my work as a behavioral and data scientist, I've seen a strong connection between faculty diversity and student retention rates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Think back to your own school days: The people who inspired you, advised you and made you feel included were probably both peers and teachers. Connecting with a particular faculty member could make you feel special -- that you brought something unique to the program, that you had a sense of psychological safety. On the flip side, if you didn't engage with faculty, you may have felt alienated and isolated. You may have begun to wonder whether you should quit the program or the school altogether.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Diverse faculty bodies can provide students with different ways to dream about their own future and remain engaged in school. They help students see how people from different backgrounds can succeed from varied starting points. Once students from ethnic and racial minorities get into a program, the presence of diverse faculty members helps them persist and earn their degrees. This persistence is grounded in what has been called a growth mind-set, and it's something that a diverse faculty body can help instill. Without students seeing a piece of themselves in the faculty around them, they may not grasp that everyone's abilities can grow through effort, that they can ask for help and that they can find strategies to overcome challenges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A more diverse faculty body doesn't just lead to higher retention rates for minority students. It can influence the entire student population. For example, if a college's faculty body includes a higher-than-average number of women, the rate at which students leave the school is lower and the rate of degrees awarded is higher for men and women, across ethnicities. And when the full-time faculty body includes more minorities than average, men and women earn degrees at higher rates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given the court's ruling on affirmative action, universities must do more to increase their faculty diversity -- and they can, because hiring and personnel practices for faculty are not affected by the decision on student admissions. My research points to several interventions that schools could implement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a university setting in which the part-time faculty population is more diverse than the full-time faculty body, partnering those who hold tenure with other instructors to teach core classes could allow for a more even demographic match between students and teachers. Prescribing specific strategic behaviors for instructors, such as being available to have one-on-one interactions with students, can also help. So can training faculty on how to draw all kinds of students into class discussions and the learning process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another intervention is to bring in more lecturers who have practical experience and a passion for teaching but may have been steered away from or kept out of typical paths to academia. Universities could also design visiting practitioner series on a variety of topics and invite professionals from different backgrounds to speak.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When colleges and universities gain a reputation for having a diverse faculty body, when students find out they can learn from a group of individuals with varied backgrounds and experiences, diversity in the student body is likely to follow.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even with a ban on affirmative action in admissions, there are tools schools can use to support and retain diverse talent among students and leaders. The court's decision may deny the inequities that minorities continue to face, but our universities can still do the right thing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: PHOTO: PEOPLE walk through the gates of Harvard Yard at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTOGRAPHER:Charles Krupa Associated Press</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Paola Cecchi-Dimeglio is a lawyer and data scientist.

{"id": "txt/399098963.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- de gustibus: Heaven Sustain Us: Environmentalists Have Taken Over the Dorms</h2<p>On Monday the trustees of the University of Delaware voted to approve a new yearlong residence life program. Undergraduates will be asked, in a reprise of \"show and tell,\" to bring in one of their \"favorite material objects\" and explain why it is important to them. They will be instructed to discuss intrusive questions like \"How do you define love?\" and \"Who are you voting for\" with their dorm-mates. Finally, this extracurricular curriculum will ask students to \"pick a metaphor that illustrates their view of sustainability.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you have spent any time on a college campus recently, you will realize that \"sustainability\" is the academy's favorite new buzzword. There's the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE); a Sustainable Endowments Institute that publishes a College Sustainability Report Card; an Ivy Plus Sustainability Working Group, and another one for colleges in the Northeast. There are sustainability offices and officers at dozens of schools nationwide.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>People unfamiliar with this subject might think that sustainability is just a fancy-sounding term for a smattering of environmentally friendly campus activities. But while it's true that the word does encompass recycling and higher-efficiency light bulbs, college administrations in recent years have started to give the term a more dramatic meaning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>More than 500 schools have signed AASHE's American College and University President Climates Commitment, which sets them on a path toward \"climate neutrality.\" Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University and one of the document's signers, released this humble statement: \"Colleges and Universities must lead the effort to reverse global warming for the health and well being of current and future generations.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to Lee Bodner, president of EcoAmerica, an organizer of the pledge, the schools have two years to create a comprehensive plan for \"eliminating direct emissions\" from their campuses and for integrating sustainability into their classrooms. Efforts to accomplish the former include offering free bicycle maintenance, unplugging appliances, using French-fry grease to power campus buses, providing laundry racks for clothes drying and incorporating green principles into new construction. Many schools are also working with local communities to reduce emissions. Oberlin College, Mr. Bodner tells me, has opposed the building of a coal-fired plant near its campus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If a school's efforts don't quite measure up, administrations can buy carbon offsets to help. And since academics like to travel to conferences almost as much as Al Gore does, Mr. Bodner and his colleagues have recommended such offsets to balance out all the pollution professors create with airplane fuel. So far the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, is the only school to have achieved \"carbon neutrality,\" buying $25,000 of these indulgences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for the curricular advances, Arizona State has an entire cross- disciplinary program in sustainability. Houston Community College offers training in green building certification. According to Mr. Bodner, students there learn \"practical marketable skills that are good for the community.\" Yale hasn't signed the pledge, but it has publicly promised to reduce its greenhouse gas levels to 10% below their 1990 level by 2020. And it already has 60 courses in which students can study issues of sustainability, according to Julie Newman, the director of the office of sustainability there. Graduate students can get joint degrees in \"the environment and business and the environment and divinity school,\" and Ms. Newman hopes that such opportunities can be expanded to undergraduates soon.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Academic opportunities aside, Ms. Newman, excitedly touts the ways in which sustainability programs \"are becoming part of students' everyday lives.\" But wait. Are these administrators gushing because students are, say, unplugging their laptops before leaving on winter break? Of course not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The sustainability folks have a much bigger agenda. As Mr. Bodner explains: \"Sustainability, broadly speaking, is creating the ability for people to live on a planet that can support the population in an environmental way but also ultimately a way that promotes the good life for everyone, for social justice.\" And Kathleen Kerr, the head of residence life at the University of Delaware, told a gathering of college administrators last fall that the idea that \"sustainability is mostly about the environment\" is a \"myth.\" In fact, she and a colleague offered a PowerPoint presentation listing other items that administrators might consider in this category. They included \"Fair Trade,\" \"Gender Equity,\" \"Affirmative Action,\" \"Multicultural Competence,\" \"Worker's Rights\" and \"Domestic Partnerships.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Which brings us back to those Delaware dorms. Thanks to some outside pressure from free-speech-on-campus groups like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, the university's indoctrination schemes at least won't be mandatory. But they probably don't need to be. Students are generally among the most enthusiastic proponents of such nonsense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And college administrators couldn't be happier that their young charges have rallied around this cause. After all, as Peter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars explains, universities have been trying for decades to \"create community\" on campus. Undergraduates complain that campuses are too balkanized. This is the result, Mr. Wood explains, of the rejection of the administration's in loco parentis role, the rise of research universities and the institution of diversity programs to remind students how different they are from each other. \"So administrators thought they could generate community by focusing on some inspiring issue. They turned to the residence life folks and said: 'You have a new mission.

{"id": "txt/424037421.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>ESSAY; CARTER'S GOOD DEED; by William Safire</h2<p>Time was, the top 7,000 Civil Service employees - the creme de la creme of the Federal bureaucracy - were locked into their jobs, unable to be moved or even influenced by an incoming Administration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then, in 1978, came ''Carter's Good Deed.'' Under a Civil Service reform act, President Carter, working with Senator Percy in the Senate (credit where due, and all that) took a great stride toward making the bureaucracy manageable: the creme de la creme were herded into a Senior Executive Service, made eligible for bonuses when they were outstanding, but separated from specific job tenure. It is now possible for a newly appointed Cabinet officer to shuffle around his upper middle management.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a result, we have an infinitely more responsive top bureaucracy. Only a Democrat could have done it -under Nixon or Ford, such an attempt would have been labeled a pernicious power grab. Many civil servants in politically sensitive jobs - general counsels, Congressional liaisons -have already selected open slots into which they can be transferred; others have a new incentive to show the new bosses they can be effective workers in jobs they now hold. Hats off, Jimmy Carter, for a real improvement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But then, at the last minute, the politicians running Justice tainted Carter's Good Deed.  People entering the Civil Service from college, starting at the bottom, have had to take a written test called the Professional and Administrative Career Examination (PACE). It's a fair test, stressing job-related questions insuring that merit and not political influence is the criterion for hiring.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because only 5 percent of blacks and 13 percent of Hispanics who take the test pass, compared to 42 percent whites, a civil rights group filed a lawsuit to do away with the merit test. Instead, a quota would be established based on the percentage of minorities applying, and other tests or nontests created to admit that quota.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''That is so manifestly unfair,'' wrote William Raspberry, the columnist, ''that it bids to cut the moral ground right from under the whole concept of affirmative action .... Forget elemental fairness. If the test doesn't produce the proper racial results, then keep fiddling around with it until it does.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Carter's Justice Department did not want to defend the Government against the lawsuits. A consent decree was worked out surrendering to many of the plaintiff's demands, despite con-cerns from Treasury about lowering the quality of I.R.S. agents, and a caution from merit-conscious Margery Waxman, general counsel of the Office of Personnel Management, to include the newly elected Attorney General in the decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the night of Jan. 8, two weeks before Reagan's inauguration, Associate Attorney General John Shenefield assured the Reagan transition team at Justice that he had not yet decided to sign the decree. However, a court hearing had already been arranged for the next morning; the Reagan men were tipped off in time to appear in court to ask for delay, but a liberal Democratic judge gave preliminary approval to the Carter deal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reached in the Virgin Islands, Mr. Shenefield argued that the consent deal specified no quotas, and that if he had gone to trial, ''a Federal judge would be more stringent than that settlement.'' I think he's wrong.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In his first week in office, Attorney General William French Smith (no longer to be derided in this space as ''Mr. French Smith'' - we had lunch and I sold out) wrote the judge on Monday that he would advise the court by Feb. 9 ''in the event that the views of the United States differ from those previously expressed.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let's hope the Reagan views differ strongly, and that the Reagan Justice Department will refuse to go along with the final-days political deal. The Attorney General should ask the court to disapprove the consent decree so that the Government can try the case. The liberal judge, who pointed out to transition lawyers that the President-elect had no standing, will probably refuse; if that is appealed, the liberal Court of Appeals in Washington is likely to uphold a decision not to try the case; then, maybe, it will go to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since the issue of quotas versus merit is clearly involved, the Reagan Administration should fight this all the way. No written test, PACE or not, should be the sole criterion in hiring at the entry level - interviewers should search for motivation, personality and work habits as well, providing affirmative-action opportunity. But we do not need unqualified people of any race on the Federal payroll, and such tests help keep standards up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Good Deed, followed by the political cave-in - the Carter record in Civil Service is a microcosm of the last four years. We can thank him for the ability to move around the people at the top, even as we try to fix the mess he created at the bottom.</p>\n"}

Barack Obama not only confronted race in his speech Tuesday, he transcended it, and no honest American ear could ever be immune to the pitch, tone and quality of his words; not yours, not mine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So much of what he said was undeniable and true and honestly spoken, in the calm and clear voice of a reasonable man explaining America's most unreasonable and hateful topic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"We've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that's it's based solely on the desire of wide-eyed liberals to purchase reconciliation on the cheap,\" said the senator from Illinois.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"On the other end, we've heard my former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation; that rightly offend white and black alike.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As he spoke, I saw him as the next president of the United States and thought of voters feeling the same. A few moments afterward, one of the wire service headlines said: \"Obama Speech Confronts Racial Division,\" a view certain to continue, reinforced by the media at every opportunity, that Obama faced the dragon and emerged from Philadelphia as triumphant as</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>St. George. All of this is quite nice indeed. But confronting race wasn't the task at hand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Obama's obligation Tuesday was not to talk about race. We talk and talk about race in America. We use it to measure everything, from public contracts to college and graduate school admission standards and, sometimes, it seems we talk of nothing else.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No, Obama's job was to address and condemn and isolate his candidacy and his nation from the ugly, anti-American rhetoric espoused by his pastor, Rev. Wright.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In talking to Tribune reporters about this Friday, and in other comments made over the  weekend, Obama offered the view that Wright's passions were set in the Jim Crow '50s and '60s, and you can hear the anger in Wright's comments as a relic of our ugly, racist, American past.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet anyone remotely interested in the truth of the Wright/Obama story knows this one isn't really about race in the conventional sense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is about the fact that Wright cursed the United States and blasphemed from the pulpit. It is about the fact that videos of Wright's comments are circulated endlessly on the Internet, no doubt to the delight of Bill and Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is about the fact that on the Sunday following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Rev. Wright offered this particularly hateful bit of homily that sounds ghost-written by Louis Farrakhan:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"America's chickens  are coming home to roost.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Does Obama believe or countenance such ugly nonsense? Of course not. His is truly an American story, impossible anywhere but here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet when we confront race in America, shouldn't we not only confront white racism, but another type, mostly unmentioned and rhetorically dangerous, in which black leaders of Wright's generation sometimes say ridiculous and hateful things and are shielded?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In America's unofficial white liberal catechism that frames so much of the discussion, whites often pretend they don't hear such black hate speech, because to hear it would compel them to challenge it, and a challenge offers the prospect of being denounced by black leadership as racist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is nothing more terrified than a white political reporter about to be called a racist. Unless, of course, it is a \"transcendent\" black presidential candidate of great promise, harangued by political thugs as not being black enough, perhaps concerned he'd be denounced as a traitor if he condemned not only Wright's words, but Wright himself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Obama must have heard such hate speech from that pulpit for years and said nothing of it, even though the white grandmother who loved him and helped raise him would have certainly cringed before Wright's anger.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet Obama did invoke his grandmother Tuesday in his speech. He said she loved him even though he'd heard her admit some racial prejudice that \"made me cringe.\" He treated Wright as a complicated man, yet he reduced his grandmother to a two-dimensional rhetorical device, to protect her grandson from criticism that he didn't go far enough to condemn Wright's foolishness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He was saying: I love Wright, who is black. I love my grandmother, who is white. Would you have me damn my own beloved grandmother by damning Wright, as he damned the United States?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It hurt me to watch it. And, I hope for his sake, that it hurt him to say it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Obama joined Wright's church for a reason, just as he knew there was a reason the political fixer Tony Rezko was trying to seduce him. Obama is no fool. He gets to the edge of things.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So on Tuesday, he stepped lightly, expertly shifting the debate about Wright to a wider debate on solid ground, about race and American hopes and American guilt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>jskass@tribune.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2777084926.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>DeSantis May Have Been Right</h2<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In January, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida announced he would ban a draft curriculum proposed by the College Board for a new Advanced Placement course in African American studies, criticizing the educational merit of the course. This month the College Board released an official curriculum that revised the course by designating some of the writers and ideas in the draft curriculum as optional topics of study rather than core lessons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The board claimed that the changes were responses to \u201cthe input of professors\u201d and \u201clongstanding A.P. principles.\u201d I am unconvinced, to say the least, especially given the degree to which the counsel of these \u201cprofessors\u201d was mysteriously consonant with DeSantis\u2019s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to make clear that I disapprove of the vast majority of DeSantis\u2019s culture warrior agenda, a ham-handed set of plans designed to stir up a G.O.P. base in thrall to unreflective figures such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. If DeSantis runs for president, he will not get my vote.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, even a stopped clock is right twice a day, and in terms of how we tell the story of Black America, the board did the right thing, whether because of DeSantis\u2019s threat or for more high-minded reasons. The take that I saw in the course\u2019s original draft depicted the history of Black America over the past several decades as an unbroken stream of left protest against a seemingly unchanging racist hegemon. There is certainly drama in the procession. The Black Panthers, the Black arts movement, Black studies departments, Black Lives Matter. Incarceration, reparations and Black struggle. Amiri Baraka, Molefi Kete Asante, Manning Marable (all notably left-leaning writers). But Black history has been ever so much more than protest and professional pessimism; note how hard it is to imagine any other group of people whose history is written with this flavor so dominant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is not education but advocacy. And in no sense does racism mean that the difference has no meaning. The key issue is the difference between opinions that are considered and debated and opinions that are mostly uncontested and perhaps considered uncontestable \u2014 essentially opinions that are treated as if they were facts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, it is possible to teach about opinions rather than facts. When that is properly done, the opinions are presented along with intelligent counterproposals. Given that Black conservatives \u2014 or skeptics of progressive narratives often processed as mainstream after the late 1960s \u2014 were nowhere to be found in the A.P. curriculum (except for Booker T. Washington, who has been dead for over a hundred years, and Zora Neale Hurston, whose conservatism is all too often downplayed), it is reasonable to assume that opinions from the left were going to be presented with little or no meaningful challenge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Certain takes on race are thought of by an influential portion of progressive Americans \u2014 Black, white and otherwise \u2014 as incarnations of social justice. To them, our nation remains an incomplete project that will remain mired in denial until these ways of seeing race are universally accepted and determine the bulk of public policy. These issues include ones in the earlier version of the A.P. course, such as the idea that Black people may be owed reparations and that one of the most accurate lenses through which to view America is through the lens of intersectionality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I imagine that to people of this mind-set, incorporating these views into an A.P. course on African American studies is seen as a natural step, via which we help get America woken by appealing to its brightest young minds. But for all the emotional resonance, the savory intonation of key buzzwords and phrases and the impassioned support of people with advanced degrees and prize-awarded media status, views of this kind remain views.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To dismiss those in disagreement as either na\u00efve or malevolent is unsophisticated, suggesting that racial enlightenment requires comfort with a take-no-prisoners approach and facile reasoning. Not even the tragedies of America\u2019s record on race justify saying \u201cI\u2019m just right, dammit!\u201d as if the matter were as settled as the operations of gravity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s article \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d which appeared in The Atlantic in 2014 and focused on the injustice of redlining policies in mortgage lending until the late 1960s, stimulated a nationwide discussion. It was initially listed as a \u201csource for consideration\u201d in the course. However, for all the impact of that intelligent, influential and well-written article, the idea that reparations are owed is open to wide dispute. It is a proposal and one that many Black people reject. (Useful examples of that, from long before the Coates article was published, are here).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some think that despite the injustices of the past, people in the present should achieve via their own efforts. Others contest the causal link between past discrimination and Black America\u2019s current problems \u2014 a key plank in today\u2019s reparations arguments. Some observe that Blackness alone is too ambiguous a concept in our endlessly hybridized society, i.e., they acknowledge what almost all believe, which is that our concept of race is a messy, contingent fiction. I think the Great Society programs, affirmative action, the loosening of welfare programs in the late 1960s, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and other significant policies have already been conceived of as a form of reparations, if not under the name itself. Reparations advocates have some answers to those objections, but even they fail to establish reparations as a moral absolute. The issue remains a controversy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Intersectionality is a similar matter, in part as it seems a stand-in for the more openly controversial critical race theory. The very definition of C.R.T. has become a shifting target, rather like the term \u201cneoliberal\u201d or what it means to say that two people dated. However, the implication in much discussion \u2014 that C.R.T. is a mere matter of the legal scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\u2019s concept of intersectionality, documenting that race, gender and other factors condition how people process life \u2014 is coy. No school of legal or academic thought could consist solely of that unexceptionable and even rather obvious observation. What worries many about C.R.T. are the conclusions its advocates draw from this intersectionality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The original draft did not explicitly mention C.R.T., as opposed to intersectionality. However, it is reasonable to suppose that many teachers would use intersectionality as a springboard for instructing students, for example, that white people can be conceived as a single mass of domination and that racism is baked into America\u2019s very essence in ways inescapable and unending. We must note that criticism of Crenshaw\u2019s removal from the course \u2014 which took place in the College Board\u2019s modified draft \u2014 often claim that detractors don\u2019t want students to know the truth about America, something that overshoots the mere excision of the term \u201cintersectionality\u201d and implies a sanctioning of students being taught something broader and more judgmental.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some C.R.T. advocates, for example, conclude that systemic oppression means that views from those oppressed via intersectionality must be accepted without question, as a kind of group narrative that renders it egregious to quibble over the details and nuances of individual experience. As the C.R.T. pioneer Richard Delgado put it, nonwhite people should protest based on a \u201cbroad story of dashed hopes and centuries-long mistreatment that afflicts an entire people and forms the historical and cultural background of your complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But this perspective, called standpoint epistemology, while intended as social justice, also questions empiricism and logic. Who really thinks that its absence from an A.P. course constitutes denying that slavery happened or that racism exists? C.R.T. advocates too often discuss white people as an undifferentiated mass, as in claims that white people resist letting go of their power, a view memorably promulgated by the legal scholar Derrick Bell. There is a rhetorical power in this sociological shorthand, but it also encourages a shallow classification of American individuals as bad white people and good everybody else. Fact this is not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To pretend that where Blackness is concerned, certain views must be treated as truth despite intelligent and sustained critique is to give in to the illogic of standpoint epistemology: \u201cThat which rubs me the wrong way is indisputably immoral.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And I hardly see this as applying only to people I disagree with. I have broadcast my views about race for almost a quarter century. Naturally, I consider my views correct \u2014 that\u2019s why they are my views \u2014 and contrary to what some may suppose, conservative white people are by no means the core of people who often see things my way. I am always gladdened to find that there are quite a few Black people from all walks of life who agree with me. Yet I would protest seeing my views on race included in an A.P. course as facts or uncontested opinions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are certainly conservatives who think discussion of racism should be entirely barred from public life. This is, on its face, blinkered, ignorant and pathetic. But to pretend that controversial views on race from the left are truth incarnate is being dishonest about race as well. It sacrifices logic out of a quiet terror of being called racist (or, if Black, self-hating). How that is progressive or even civil in a real way is unclear to me. In being honest enough to push past the agitprop, I hate having to say that in this case, DeSantis, of all people, was probably right.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>John McWhorter (@JohnHMcWhorter) is an associate professor of linguistics at Columbia University.

Pete Wilson, Florida Rep. Charles Canady and House Speaker Newt Gingrich blast the race for reverse discrimination?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The organizers of the Bolder Boulder race have made up new rules that will allow only three runners from Kenya and three each from other foreign countries to compete. Any American who finishes in the top five will earn double the prize money. This virtually ensures that the elite runners will be mostly white Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Bolder Boulder organizers are the latest to join the escalating movement to limit (or ban outright) Africans from races and award Americans a bigger hunk of the prize money. They've made this bit of reverse discrimination official by forming the U.S.A. Circuit, which pays prize money almost exclusively to Americans. The circuit has been endorsed by the U.S. Track and Field Federation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The squawk about foreigners taking over American road racing is hypocritical and racist. When white British, Norwegian, Australian and New Zealand runners overran American road races in the late 1970s and '80s, there were no complaints about foreign domination of racing. There is no outcry to bar Canadians from American hockey teams, Russian skaters from U.S. skating competition, South African golfers from tournaments or French and British players from tennis tournaments in the U.S.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If European nations decided to indulge in athletic protectionism and limit the number of Americans who can compete or reduce their prize money on the lucrative European track circuit, Americans would howl in protest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Racing organizers, however, aren't really concerned with banning foreigners from American competition. They're concerned with the Africans, or more specifically the Kenyans. Although other countries have world-class caliber runners, they do not have them in the numbers that the Kenyans do. They claim that the Kenyans are just too good, and they're right. In 1997, Kenyan men grabbed the top spots in the New York, Honolulu and Boston marathons. The Kenyans finished first and second in this year's Boston marathon. In the 1997-98 Professional Road Racing Circuit, which awards $379,000 in prize money, Kenyan men occupy the top seven places. There are no American runners in the top 25.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While the Kenyan runners, by the standards of their country, where annual per capita income is $280, have become fabulously wealthy, they have not literally taken American money and run. In many cities, they have conducted popular clinics for young runners. This year's Boston Marathon winner, Moses Tanui, publicly invited American runners to train at his running clinic in Kenya. But this means nothing to those race directors who want the Africans out of American racing. They are scared that hordes of black Kenyans dominating races will make it harder to get corporate dollars and media attention for their events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In promoting this reverse discrimination, the organizers of Bolder Boulder and other races ignore the fact that distance running never has been the sole property of any one country. It is and always has been an international sport that aimed to break down racial and gender barriers. Their white elitism also makes a cheap mockery of the much-touted Olympic goal of promoting international harmony among the athletes and peoples of the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even though the move to ban the Kenyans panders to virulent national chauvinism and racism, rewards mediocrity and guarantees that Americans will be even less competitive in road racing, the director of Bolder Boulder still defiantly declares that American sponsors want American winners or at least Americans among the top finishers. This is blatant advocacy of preference over merit and quotas over qualification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Again, I ask, will the outspoken opponents of affirmative action who preach to women and minorities the importance of talent, ability, performance and hard work protest a policy that rewards less-qualified white Americans?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of \"The Crisis in Black and Black.\" E-mail: ehutchi344@aol.com.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTO: Earl Ofari Hutchinson</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of \"The Crisis in Black and Black.\"</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/430509546.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>A View from Berkeley</h2<p>Chang-Lin Tien has been Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley since July 1990.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the debate over affirmative action in higher education started to simmer, the stance I took as Chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley seemed to surprise many people.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To be sure, my view -- that we should consider race, ethnicity and gender along with many other factors in admissions -- has put me at odds with some constituencies, including the majority of the Regents of the University of California, who govern my campus. Last July, these officials voted to end affirmative action admission policies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And with California voters to decide later this year whether to end all state affirmative action programs, silence might seem a more prudent course for the head of a major public university. We already have enough battles to fight, my staff sometimes reminds me: declining public funding, for example.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's also true that a few students and friends have hinted that it might make more sense for me, as an Asian American, to oppose affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Asian Americans, who are not considered underrepresented minorities under affirmative action, have divergent views. Some are disturbed by the ''model minority'' stereotype applied to them; they say it pits them against other minorities and hides the discrimination they still face. Others -- including the two Asian American Regents who voted to end affirmative action at the university -- believe the only fair approach is to base admissions on academic qualifications only. That approach would also open the door to more Asian Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So why do I strongly support affirmative action? My belief has been shaped by my role in higher education. And by my experience as a Chinese immigrant.i</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I know first-hand that America can be a land of opportunity. When I came here, I was a penniless 21-year-old with a limited grasp of the language and culture. Yet I was permitted to accomplish a great deal. My research in heat transfer contributed to better nuclear reactor safety and space shuttle design. My former students are professors and researchers at some of America's best schools and business concerns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But as I struggled to finish my education here, I also encountered the ugly realities of racial discrimination. This, too, is part of America's legacy and -- like it or not -- it is inextricably connected to the need for affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I first arrived in this country in 1956 as a graduate student, for example, I lived in Louisville, Ky. One day I got on a bus and saw that all the black people were in the back, the white people in the front. I didn't know where I belonged, so for a long time I stood near the driver. Finally, he told me to sit down in the front, and I did. I didn't take another bus ride for a whole year. I would walk an hour to avoid that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I served as a teaching fellow at Louisville for a professor who refused to pronounce my name. He addressed me as ''Chinaman.'' One day he directed me to adjust some valves in a large laboratory apparatus. Climbing a ladder, I lost my balance and instinctively grabbed a nearby steam pipe. It was scorchingly hot and produced a jolt of pain that nearly caused me to faint. Yet I did not scream. Instead, I stuffed my throbbing hand into my coat pocket and waited until the class ended. Then I ran to the hospital emergency room, where I was treated for a burn that had singed all the skin off my palm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Outwardly, my response fit the stereotype of the model-minority Asian: I said nothing and went about my business. But my silence had nothing to do with stoicism. I simply did not want to endure the humiliation of having the professor scold me in front of the class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, four decades later, there have been major civil rights advances in America. But serious racial divisions remain. That's why colleges and universities created affirmative admissions programs. The idea was to open the doors to promising minority students who lacked educational and social opportunities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As Berkeley's chancellor, I have seen the promise of affirmative action come true. No racial or ethnic group constitutes a majority among our 21,000 undergraduates. And Berkeley students enter with higher grades and test scores than their predecessors. They graduate at the highest rate in our history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think that affirmative action should be a temporary measure, but the time has not yet come to eliminate it. Educational opportunities for inner-city minority students, for example, still contrast dramatically with those of affluent students in the suburbs, where many white families live.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And as a public institution, the university needs to look at broader societal needs, including greater leadership training of California's sizable African-American and Hispanic population.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I try to explain this when, as occasionally happens, Asian-American or white friends complain to me that their child, a straight-A student, didn't get into Berkeley because we give spaces to others. I also mention that we use admission criteria other than test scores, grades and ethnicity, including  a genius for computers, musical talent, geographical diversity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Besides, a straight-A average wouldn't guarantee admission to Berkeley even if there were no affirmative action. For a freshman class with 3,500 places, we get about 25,000 applicants. This year, 10,784 of them had a 4.0 high school record.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What's more, helping minority students may not be the most compelling reason for preserving affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Every time I walk across campus, I am impressed by the vibrant spirit of this diverse community. In teeming Sproul Plaza, the dozens of student groups who set up tables represent every kind of social, political, ethnic and religious interest. In the dorms, students from barrios, suburbs, farm towns and the inner city come together.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When there are diverse students, staff and faculty (among whom there are still too few minorities) everybody stands to gain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, interactions between students of different backgrounds can occasionally bring misunderstanding. Some white students tell me they feel squeezed out by black and Latino students they believe are less deserving, as well as by overachieving Asian American students. Some African-American and Latino students confide they sometimes feel their professors and white classmates consider them academically inferior, a view that's slow to change even when they excel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, the overall message I get time and again from students and recent graduates is that they have valued the chance to challenge stereotypes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So I was stunned by the Regents' decision to end affirmative action admissions policies, which goes into effect by 1998. I even debated whether to resign.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In Chinese, however, the character for ''crisis'' is actually two characters: one stands for danger and the other for opportunity. And I took the Chinese approach. Noting that the Regents had reaffirmed their commitment to diversity when they discarded affirmative action, I decided to stay to try to make a difference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Recently, I joined the superintendents of the major urban school districts of the San Francisco Bay area to announce a campaign: The Berkeley Pledge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Under this program, Berkeley is deepening its support for disadvantaged youth trying to qualify for admission. One way will be to provide educational expertise for teachers; another will be to create incentives for pupils at selected school ''pipelines'' that begin in kindergarten. We also are stepping up our recruitment of exceptional minority students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>America has come a long way since the days of Jim Crow segregation. It would be a tragedy if our nation's colleges and universities slipped backward now, denying access to talented but disadvantaged youth and eroding the diversity that helps to prepare leaders.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/418315534.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>CLIMBING OUT OF EDUCATION'S MORASS THE GROWING CASE FOR SCHOOL VOUCHERS ... AND GETTING A HANDLE ON COLLEGE TUITION HIKES</h2<p>The only student demonstration I ever led, back in the heady, naive days when I was editor of the Daily Northwestern and looking for good stories, protested against Northwestern's raising tuition by an outrageous 33 percent. We lost, of course. But the big-time media coverage was gratifying. And for a time, we even dared to hope we had made our point.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tuition jumps have long since ceased to be news. They now seem as inevitable as taxes, have increased at least twice as fast as the cost of living for years and are related more to how much colleges can extort from families than to a straightforward accounting of costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Parents are now warned they should start saving for their children's college expenses no later than at birth. If they come up short--and it can now cost about $30,000 for one year at a selective private college--they must prove it on intrusive financial aid forms that dissect their income and assets. Then they may get a financial aid package, perhaps with some grant money, but heavy on an array of loans and part-time student jobs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now President Clinton, trying to make political points with parents obsessed and overburdened with college costs, is proposing some relief. His plan is a mix of tax breaks and grants that would cost taxpayers billions of dollars and in some ways would make the problem worse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What is supposed to appeal most to parents is what Clinton calls Hope Scholarships, which would give parents either a tax credit of $1,500 a year for a child's first two years in college, provided the student maintains a B average and stays off drugs, or a $10,000 deduction from taxable income. The tax breaks would phase out when family income is between $50,000 and $100,000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Problems with the plan are obvious and were pointed out to Clinton before he announced it. The tax credits are not refundable, so the poorer the family and the less income tax they pay, the less help they would be. The new money would reduce the amount of aid students from poor families get from Pell grants and other federal sources, although the president did propose increasing Pell amounts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But how would the government make sure a student isn't using drugs? Would he have to submit urine test results with his parents' income tax returns? Or would colleges be required to make spot drug checks of their Hope Scholarship students? Would the requirement that students keep a B average lead to even more grade inflation and to IRS monitoring of college records?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The biggest catch is that the extra money from taxpayers almost certainly wouldn't end up reducing families' exorbitant costs. Instead, it would encourage colleges to raise their tuition even higher, knowing there were extra dollars they could soak up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>President Clinton's plan does nothing to get at a basic question: Why should total costs of a year of schooling (nine months or less in reality) at a selective private college be almost as high as the median annual household income in the United States? The answer is that colleges, especially those that are private and prestigious, charge what the market will bear. Parents have been conditioned to equate \"most expensive\" with \"best.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most selective private schools are careful to keep their tuition--and total charges--rising at about the same rates, so families have little or nothing to gain by shopping around for a price advantage. Until an antitrust investigation several years ago, Ivy League schools and MIT even traded information about the aid packages they planned to offer individual students accepted to more than one of the colleges and made adjustments to avoid price competition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many state universities and colleges are superb and provide splendid education at lower cost than private institutions because of tax support. But costs have risen sharply here, too. Tuition in four-year public colleges has jumped 234 percent since 1980 compared to a 74 percent increase in Consumer Price Index.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are plenty of reasons for the higher-than-inflation increases in college costs. Enrollments grew rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, prompting campus expansions, new buildings, more faculty and administrators. Federal funding has slowed. Energy costs have risen. Security needs have increased. Faculty salaries are higher and teaching loads lighter. Student recruitment expenses have grown. Curriculum choices have expanded. Technology costs are soaring. Affirmative action has increased the number of students needing financial help.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because they have not encountered any significant consumer resistance, colleges also continue to raise tuition to what they think the market will bear, using creative justifications to show how urgently all that money is needed. And they are getting away with it, as increasing numbers of applications for admission show.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Maybe, after all these years and all those tuition increases, protesting doesn't seem like such a naive idea.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1955906529.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Let's Agree: Racial Affirmative Action Failed</h2<p>We disagree in principle about affirmative action. One of us, a frequent fundraiser for Democratic candidates, believes that it's better for colleges to have a diverse student body that more faithfully reflects the nation; and that we need to counterbalance the impact of poverty on education and opportunity, which often means giving special consideration to minority students. The other, a former Reagan staffer, believes consideration of race is intrinsically unfair and hinders race relations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But we agree that race-based affirmative action hasn't worked. Because of how it has played out in practical terms, it's time for colleges to shift the policy from being based on race to income.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Affirmative action's original intent was to incorporate more minority students, specifically blacks and Hispanics, into elite universities. But blacks and Hispanics have actually lost ground in the admissions race over the past 25 years, as recently reported by the New York Times. And while the original policy was intended to help minorities, Asian-American students feel they are taking the biggest hit. As a result, many have filed lawsuits against Ivy League schools such as Harvard, claiming that to gain admission, Asian-American students, on average, have to score 140 points higher on the SAT than white students, 270 points higher than Hispanic students, and 450 points higher than African-American students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In tandem with shifting the basis for affirmative action, colleges need to be clearer about what qualifies students for admission. Many people believe that selective college admissions is, or should be, purely based on academic success. But the work of admissions officers is more complicated than finding the highest test scores. It's more like casting a movie. They want to put together an incoming freshman class that has aspiring journalists for the school newspaper, great athletes for all the teams, debaters, musicians, actors, dancers, legacies, and development prospects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Jack DeGioia, the president of Georgetown, told us that his school has to fill more than 140 separate \"buckets,\" reflecting the diversity of interests and backgrounds that will create a vibrant community. Of 19,500 Georgetown applicants last year, about half were academically qualified -- that is, they scored over the threshold of test scores and grades to put them into the qualified pool to fill those buckets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Standardized tests help admissions officers narrow their pools; they are still the most often used yardstick colleges have to compare applicants. But those tests are also very responsive to focused preparation. A new survey commissioned by Noodle found that Asian-American families spent more than twice as much money on test prep as any other group. This explains in part why Asian-American kids do so well on the exams. It's not surprising that they are disappointed when their higher scores don't result in admission to elite schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the counterintuitive admissions secret -- based on hundreds of interviews we've conducted with college admissions directors, deans and presidents over 25 years -- is that an additional 10 or 20 points on the SAT above the (secret) threshold doesn't improve one's chances of getting in. That's because admissions officers know that standardized tests are best at measuring how hard someone prepares for the test. They are less useful at predicting whether an applicant will be an academic star in college. Consequently, admissions officers place much more weight on the rigor of academic courses and teacher recommendations to help identify the most promising students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The application essay is another tool for admissions officers, which they use to identify applicants who are generous, considerate and thoughtful -- and to weed out those who obviously are not. Then they look for evidence of long-term commitments to extracurricular interests, volunteer activities and even after-school and summer jobs, to fill those buckets and leaven the college community.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One way schools could make admissions less \"unfair\" and a bit less stressful is to be more transparent about their scoring rubrics -- the combination of GPA, SAT and course selection that get an applicant into the \"possible\" pile. Colleges could say: \"To be a serious candidate for admission, you need a 3.2 GPA and 1200 SAT scores. Of course, if you are a potential All-American athlete, an all-state flutist, or have a family income under $35,000, we'll probably make allowances. But importantly, once you've met that threshold, we really do not care if your grades or SAT scores are higher. At that stage, we're looking for interesting, nice kids with a passion.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the 2003 pivotal decision in Grutter v. Bollinger, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that colleges should not need race-conscious decision policies in 25 years; that was 14 years ago.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now is the time to make the switch from a \"minority\" bucket to a \"grit\" bucket -- for applicants of any race who've risen above economic adversity -- and to be transparent about this change. Whether on the left or right, fair people cannot begrudge a boost in the admissions process for a young person who overcomes poverty and inferior local schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rather than continue to pretend that college admissions is one giant academic meritocracy, let's be more candid about the complex and idiosyncratic needs of each school. Let's explicitly reward students who have overcome disadvantaged financial beginnings, but not give one race an advantage over another. This is where we begin to create better outcomes and build a fairer, healthier system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Katzman is CEO of Noodle and founder of the Princeton Review and 2U.

{"id": "txt/424877371.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>WOMEN VS. REAGAN</h2<p>Wil l Ronald Reagan, central casting's gift to the media, win an electoral Oscar from the voters next November? Before accepting the conventional wisdom that Mr. Reagan is unbeatable, political prophets should consider strong evidence that the President is worse off with the electorate - and women particularly - than he was four years ago.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rather than just another special-interest group, women are the biggest eligible voting group in the nation (53 percent); in 1980, six million more women than men voted, and in 1984 they may outnumber male voters by more than nine million.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last year, Mr. Reagan's campaign director, Edward J. Rollins, warned that ''the political party that gets the women's vote will be the majority</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>party, while the party of men will be the minority.'' Mr. Reagan received only 21 million votes from women in 1980, while Jimmy Carter and John B. Anderson got 25 million. In the last three years, President Reagan has so successfuly alienated millions of women from all walks of life that he will most likely get an even lower total in 1984.  The President is threatened not only by intensive voter registration drives by major organizations of women, blacks, minorities and labor but also by the loss of significant support from two female groups that were among his mainstay in 1980: Republican women and older women. In 1980, when there was an 8 percent gender gap between Republican men and women voters, 13 percent of the women defected; last June, a New York Times/CBS News Poll showed a startling 24 percent gender gap on the question of whether Mr. Reagan deserves another term.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And last June, a Republican poll that found that ''every subgroup of women is more negative towards President Reagan than their male counterparts'' cited older women, those over age 55, as among the most negative. This switch can be traced to fears raised by Mr. Reagan's attempt to tamper with Social Security and the one-year freeze of cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The President's efforts to bridge the widening gender gap have been largely cosmetic, callous and unconvincing. In that great gush of syrupy platitudes that served as his report on the State of the Union, Mr. Reagan cited Barbara Proctor, a black business woman ''who rose from a ghetto to build a multimillion dollar advertising agency in Chicago,'' to assure women that they too could become Harriet Algers. In an interview the next morning, Mrs. Proctor said she shared the President's spiritual values but attributed her success to affirmative action and Federal loans, both favorite targets of the Reagan Administration.Mrs. Proctor's prosperity is typical neither of black nor white women.  Only one percent of American women earn more than $25,000; three out of five working women earn less than $10,000; and the wage gap for black women is 54 cents on the dollar and 49 cents for Hispanic women - if they are fortunate enough to have jobs.  Behind Mr. Reagan's ''nice guy'' image and talk of old-fashioned family values is a tough reactionary who wants to keep women in their low-paid economic ghetto and dump kids from school lunch programs. Most revealing of his motives is his Administration's plan to challenge a Federal court decision ordering the State of Washington to pay an estimated $642 million in back pay and $195 million in raises to female state employees who were paid less than men in jobs of comparable worth.  For Mr. Reagan to win a majority of the women's vote, he would have to stop picking their pockets and stop being himself. By significant majorities, women favor genuine peace initiatives, the nuclear freeze, cuts in military spending, an end to armed intervention in Lebanon and Central America, enforced environmental protection, the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion rights, family planning, equity in the job market and pay envelope and more Government spending for social programs, child care, education and other human services. The President's record and continuing actions place him in direct opposition to the political agenda of modern American women.  According to our projections, Mr. Reagan will need 59.3 percent of the male vote to win in 1984, compared with the 54 percent he received in 1980. He will need about 65 percent of the votes of white males. The 49 percent support he received from blue- collar males and the 47 percent support from male unionists in 1980 is not likely to be increased or even duplicated in 1984 - not with more than nine million Americans still unemployed.  The President has a big problem with women and with male voters hurt by Reaganomics. He can be defeated.</p>\n"}

But what is its true value?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Diversity is a serious plank in the platform for equality generally: equality, be it noted, not of opportunity but of result. Diversity -- in universities, corporations, government, TV commercials -- is in part a deliberate attempt to make amends for past injustices. The intention is to bring minority groups out from their positions of marginality into the center of institutions, politics and culture generally.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Universities employ deans and associate provosts whose entire task is to foster diversity. One such person was recently hired \"to realize an ideal Northwestern University where community members are challenged to engage differences as strengths in an environment that ensures equality of access, opportunity, participation and representation.\" When I spoke to a friend who teaches at Northwestern about what seemed to me the emptiness and unnecessary expense of such a job, he corrected me, at least partly, by pointing out that without such an administrator for diversity the school might be denied federal funds for scientific and other projects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's nothing wrong with the idealistic yearning for equality unless it gets in the way of other important goals or goods. The ideal of promised equality under communism, for example, annihilated the ideal of personal liberty. The political philosopher Isaiah Berlin often wrote about the conflict that arises when two good qualities compete. Great goods, Berlin thought, sometimes cannot live together: \"We are doomed to choose, and every choice may entail an irreparable loss.\" Is diversity, in higher education and in politics, always the right choice?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In contemporary higher education, diversity competes with intellectual authority, based on scholarly and scientific accomplishment. These days, diversity is all but victorious and intellectual authority well in retreat. This leaves no one in a position to set or determine educational standards. University presidents, once educational leaders, now focus on fundraising and public relations. The heads of academic departments tend to accept their jobs not out of a desire for intellectual leadership but to reduce their teaching loads. Because of this want of intellectual authority, universities have now been on the slide for many years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In government, the value of diversity is often in conflict with the value of true merit, or of the real abilities of the people chosen to perform their jobs. Under identity politics, so much favored by the Democratic Party, diversity is the sine qua non. In choices for cabinet and subcabinet posts, under identity politics the desire for -- some might say the tyranny of -- diversity generally trumps past performance. Under the banner of diversity, the political version of affirmative action rules. To have, in Mr. Biden's words, \"the single most diverse cabinet . . . that has ever existed in the United States\" is considered meritorious, something grand in itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the conflict between goods, it is always worth asking who is favored and who loses because of the good chosen. In higher education we have witnessed Harvard, in its desire for diversity, turn away large numbers of highly qualified Asian-American applicants for admission. In contests for awards and prizes, diversity, too, is often the primary factor. A friend recently told me that his grandson won a Marshall Scholarship, all the more remarkable, he noted, since the kid is a white male.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>America has always been and remains a diverse country, composed of waves of immigrants seeking opportunities available nowhere else. If some groups have had to struggle to secure these opportunities, they have for the most part successfully done so. Those who oppose them are now rightly regarded as retrograde. Left to their own devices, and once freed of the harness of victim status that many of their leaders wish to bind them in, they are likely to go from strength to strength. Attempts to rig the system in their favor through the artificial arrangements that imposed diversity requires cannot ultimately help them attain the genuine equality that only true accomplishment can bring.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The best way to celebrate diversity, perhaps, is to begin by celebrating diversity of thought.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Epstein is author, most recently, of \"Gallimaufry: A Collection of Essays, Reviews, Bits.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Merit and Diversity Need Not Be in Conflict\" -- WSJ Jan. 12, 2021)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By Joseph Epstein</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/424240814.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>NEW YORK; COVERING THE WRONG WOUNDS</h2<p>Self-examination sessions by the press can be predictable, dominated by large, articulate egos, and dull. But one such panel discussion two weeks ago - at Automation House - erupted from blandness into a passion unanticipated either by its sponsors or by most of the 200 in the audience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was a passion about the race issue - which, because of recent events, including the City Council's discriminatory districting plan and the Census Bureau results showing the city to be at least 44 percent black and Hispanic - is out in the open to a degree not experienced here for over a decade.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''This is a black and brown town already,'' said a Hispanic television reporter. ''We don't see that reflected in the news. What we see is negativity when it comes to our community.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He complained not only about the lack of sensitive and sophisticated coverage of minority communities but also of what he called ''the kind of racism, sheer racism that happens all of the time in our newsroom.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As but one example, he told a story of a white reporter who had refused an assignment in a minority area, saying he would ''not go uptown and deal with those monkeys,'' and of how he was sent instead.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''It infuriates me, it sickens me,'' he said.  A veteran white reporter from the same TV station took issue with some of the remarks of his Hispanic colleague. ''I believe we have to build bridges,'' he said. ''In my view, you're suggesting a kind of divisive approach to journalism - that we have X number of black reporters and Y number of white reporters. We should have more black and Puerto Rican reporters and undoubtedly there has been a lack of sensitivity on that. But I don't think that a white reporter is insensitive to black issues or a black reporter is insensitive to white issues. I don't think that sensitivity depends on the pigment of your skin.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Hispanic shot back: ''Your argument is a 60's argument. It's old and it's rancid. What I'm talking about is policy-making ...  about who controls the images that go out over that screen. We're not talking about 'affirmative action.' ''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the white reporter tried to reply by talking about the need for traditional standards of objectivity and competence, another Hispanic television newsman leapt to his feet in the audience, shouting: ''Who passes the goddamn judgment on competency? Come on, now! Don't tell me competency. (Even) when you get the competent person in, he is not allowed (to do the job). So stop your bull!''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The force of the emotions stunned many in the room. Faces looked hurt. Decent people were being accused of that dirty word - racism.  And while they rejected, and expressed resentment over, the whiteconspiracy theories of some of their accusers, their responses confirmed the plain truth - a truth not peculiar to this generation -that those on the bottom were having a hard time getting up the ladder.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''I sympathize with you. I empathize with you,'' said the white television newsman. ''I think there is a lot of unfairness in this society.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some white newsmen, distressed and uncomfortable, tried to steer the discussion away from the race issue, arguing that while extremely important, it was not the only area where the press needed major improvement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But visceral feelings had been stirred. ''Race is the issue in this city,'' said a reporter who has been active in an affirmative-action lawsuit against his newspaper. ''You talk about competence and learning the nuts and bolts of journalism. Well, there's nobody who loves this profession more than I do. I work in a shop where black reporters can sweat and bleed to dig up exclusive stories with national attention, and those stories are taken from them and given to white reporters who sit on their duffs.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, a woman newspaper reporter rose and, for many, identified what had been happening for two hours in this room. She recalled a passage from the novel ''Catch-22'' in which Yossarian crawls to the rear of his bomber to help a wounded tail-gunner. He works hard and long to stanch a wound in the young gunner's thigh only to realize that the man is dying from a gaping hole in his chest. ''He was paying attention to the wrong wound,'' the newswoman said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''I think we are seeing here a rage, an anger. We are seeing that there are divisions between the races. I think we have to ask ourselves as journalists whether we are covering the right story. And I think it could be argued that there is something happening in this city that we - the white media, the mass media - are not covering.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>''And I think that we are seeing here the kind of rage that is going on in different pockets of the city that may come together as a majority. Maybe we're looking at and reporting on the wrong wounds.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is not necessary to agree with all the charges laid by the black and Hispanic reporters to know - from the vehemence of the storm at that media session - that the problem is real and cannot be looked away from.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398996214.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Rolling Bakke</h2<p>Proponents of public universities giving broad admissions preferences to selected racial minorities won a battle Tuesday as the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling and upheld the admissions practices of the University of Michigan Law School. But the majority was slender -- 5-4 -- and the ruling narrow. The majority opinion disdained all but token consideration of the merits of the case, instead hiding behind the Supreme Court's quirky 1978 Bakke case, declaring simply that Justice Lewis Powell's lone opinion \"remains the law until the Supreme Court instructs otherwise.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Opponents of racial preferences can take heart not only because the dissent in the case, Grutter v. Bollinger, was far more impressive than the majority opinion, but because the decision virtually forces the Supreme Court to review discriminatory practices in higher education for the first time since Bakke, if only to resolve a hopeless split among the various federal circuits. As matters now stand:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- The Fifth Circuit has held that racially discriminatory admissions policies designed to promote diversity flunk the test of constitutionality, thereby tossing aside a central contention of Justice Powell, the swing vote in Bakke.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- The Sixth and Ninth Circuits have held themselves bound by Bakke.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- The 11th Circuit has held that race is not a proxy for diversity, thus skirting the issue of whether state universities have a compelling interest in diversity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That Bakke has staggered along for nearly a quarter-century  is truly remarkable. Brought by a rejected white applicant for the University of California, Davis Medical School, the suit challenged a quota system that allocated 16% of places in each entering class to favored minority students. Four justices held the quotas a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Four others argued that the \"benign\" use of racial categories designed to redress past discrimination should not have to meet a strict \"compelling interest\" standard of judicial review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justice Powell held that the strict standard was appropriate and that the quota system was unconstitutional. But he suggested that as a matter of academic freedom, universities have an implied First Amendment right to promote a diverse student body through \"a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not a single colleague joined Justice Powell's constitutional frolic, and in  a series of cases involving state contracting, federal contracting, and congressional redistricting, the Supreme Court has rejected the consideration of race unless narrowly tailored to redress specific acts of past discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In their scramble to gain the protection of Bakke, some of the nation's leading public universities have contrived admissions practices that offend both the Constitution and admittedly quaint notions of academic integrity. Until Proposition 209 got in the way, for example, the University of California, Berkeley tinkered with a \"non quota\" matrix system that magically produced nearly identical percentages of black and Hispanic students year after year. Until stopped by the courts, the University of Texas Law School had color-coded applicant files considered by separate committees applying different standards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The University of Michigan Law School method involved admitting a \"critical mass\" of favored minorities, defined as the number necessary to \"enable minority students to contribute to classroom dialogue and not feel isolated.\" The school's dean testified that no quota system was intended, but the numbers speak otherwise. From 1995 to 1998, the law school admitted 46, 44, 46 and 47 minority applicants, respectively, in each case between 13.5% and 13.7% of the entering class. Minority students were often dozens, sometimes hundreds, of times more likely to be admitted than white applicants with similar grades and LSAT scores. University officials acknowledged that had race not been given weight, minorities would have comprised 4% or less of each class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the Michigan case moves toward the Supreme Court, the Bush administration will have to choose between principle and interest group politics. Those fearing another steel tariffs type retreat note that, last October, Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson asked the Supreme Court to reject a challenge to the affirmative action provisions of the Transportation Equity Act. But then, Mr. Olson was entering a case well advanced at the time of his confirmation, and one where the government could plausibly argue that its regulations limited preferences to situations where discrimination had been documented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even a Supreme Court decision disowning Bakke and rejecting Michigan's admissions policy is unlikely to end the struggle over race preferences.  Like Sampson, quota supporters are willing to bring down the temple rather than see enemies prevail. Already, assaults on objective admissions criteria -- such as the LSAT -- are in the works. Other jurisdictions are turning to guaranteed admission for those who achieve a threshold class standing of, say, the top 10%, a standard that ignores great differences in school quality.

{"id": "txt/418843284.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>MIT'S SELF-STUDY IS A POWERFUL LESSON FOR OTHERS IN ACADEMIA</h2<p>A recently released study on discrimination against women faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology provides powerful ammunition in support of affirmative action in academia. The MIT study comes at a critical juncture in the debate over diversity in education. There is a well-funded conservative crusade under way to erase affirmative action programs at colleges and universities across the country. Public universities in California and Texas have already succumbed to this crusade, resulting in a dramatic reduction in minority students at both the University of Texas and University of California campuses. Critics of affirmative action argue that racial and gender discrimination no longer exists and therefore special programs to combat it are unnecessary. What the MIT self-study demonstrates is that even when motivations are good, unconscious biases and assumptions, longstanding unreviewed practices and informal \"old boys\" networks contribute to a damaging pattern of discrimination that might not be visible at first glance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The persistence of sexism and racism in our society and our educational institutions indicates that affirmative action initiatives need to be improved and expanded rather than dismantled. The Department of Labor's Glass Ceiling Commission Report in 1995 reiterated this point. The commission's report also indicated the need to view gender, and I would add race, discrimination in the context of history. If we pluck affirmative action out of its historical context, it makes no sense. It is the pre-existing and pervasive history of racism and sexism that was the impetus for such programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There was a time when many elite universities refused to admit women or people of color and had quotas that also limited the number of Jews. It is still not uncommon for students to tell me that I am the first black woman professor they have encountered in the classroom, even at a major public urban university. This is not too surprising given that 80 percent of tenured university professors are white males, despite the fact that this group constitutes only 33 percent of the U.S. population. There is a long history of exclusion, marginalization and outright discrimination that the academy has to overcome. The first step is to admit guilt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The reason the MIT study is unique and important is that MIT took a critical look at itself, and then told the world what it found. Almost as a reflex, most universities are quick to defend themselves and deny discrimination even while they concede change is needed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>MIT began this process by listening to those most impacted by discrimination. In the winter of 1994, more than 2,000 scholars converged on the campus of one of the most prestigious centers for science research in the country. A large gathering of scholars at MIT was not unusual. The composition of this group, and the purpose of this gathering, was. A majority of the participants were women of African descent and the conference, titled \"Defending Our Name: Black Women in the Academy,\" was organized by two untenured African- American women faculty members. The purpose was to address the problems and progress of black women scholars. Over the course of the three-day event, women told personal stories of discrimination, marginalization and even humiliation at academic institutions, from Howard to Harvard. Obviously, at least some MIT administrators, many of whom supported and attended the conference, were listening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Soon after the gathering, MIT's administration supported the formation of a committee to assess the extent of discriminatory gender practices and recommend solutions. The content of the study is important. It roots out the subtle and unconscious forms of gender discrimination. It eliminates the need for majority faculty and administrators to say, \"We didn't mean it.\" Intention does not negate the impact of action or inaction. The MIT study found that women were treated unfairly in terms of salary, the allocation of resources and space, and retention. MIT President Charles Vest offered an endorsement of the report. In his summary he observed that in the post-Civil Rights era, \". . . discrimination consists of a pattern of powerful but unrecognized assumptions and attitudes that work systematically against women faculty even in the light of obvious good will.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the other side of the affirmative-action debate an entirely different set of forces and arguments has been amassed. The Center for Equal Opportunity (CEO)-- borrowing its name from the language used by the anti-bias movement it opposes--has funded efforts from coast to coast to discredit affirmative-action policies at public universities. Ward Connerly, the conservative African-American regent at the University of California, also has served as cheerleader and spokesman for this crusade. His skin color provides a convenient cover for a campaign harshly criticized by the majority of black, Latino and women's groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The CEO has begun to survey affirmative-action policies at Illinois schools, hoping to put school administrators on the defensive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is ironic that MIT, viewed as one of the bastions of white male privilege, has taken a leadership role in countering the right-wing assault on diversity and equity within the Academy. Other schools can learn from this example and take it further. This weekend the University of Illinois at Chicago and Malcolm X College will be the sites of a national conference on the future of affirmative action, featuring Harvard law professor Lani Guinier and Dr. Mary Frances Berry, former head of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. Let's hope the UIC gathering will attack the problem of race and gender bias rather than succumb to the bullying tactics of conservative critics of affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO: Barbara Ransby.</p>\n"}

But his current status among conservatives isn\u2019t so much rooted in Carson\u2019s redemptive rise from rags to respectability, as it is in the belief that he is, in the long winter of Obama, the one they\u2019ve been waiting for.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last week, Carson came under attack for comparing advocates of same-sex marriage with advocates of bestiality and the North American Man/Boy Love Association. He then cast himself as a victim of political correctness, besieged by white liberals \u2014 \u201cthe most racist people there are\u201d \u2014 who could not countenance his heterodoxy and wanted to keep him on the \u201cplantation.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The plantation metaphor refers to a popular theory on the right. It holds that the 95 percent of African-Americans who voted for a Democratic president are not normal Americans voting their beliefs, but slaves. A corollary to the plantation theory is the legend of the Conservative Black Hope, a lonesome outsider, willing to stare down the party of Obamacare and stand up for the party of voter ID. Does it matter that this abolitionist truth-teller serves at the leisure of an audience that is overwhelmingly white? Not really. Blacks are brainwashed slaves; you can\u2019t expect them to know what\u2019s in their interest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Benjamin Carson is that Conservative Black Hope of the moment. His rise began with a meandering speech that mixed policy, humor and victimization in February at the National Prayer Breakfast, mere feet from the president of the United States, who was forced to take his medicine in a way that Clint Eastwood could only dream of. When Sean Hannity interviewed Carson about his speech he dispensed with the policy and simply dubbed the segment \u201cLecturing Obama.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since the dawn of the Obama era, conservatives have been on the lookout for such a man. In 2004 they dispatched Alan Keyes cross-country to take up the mantle of the Conservative Black Hope and deliver an early knockout to Obama. Keyes had never lived in Illinois and his voters barely knew him, and voted accordingly. But it did not matter who he was. What mattered was their plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cWe needed to find another Harvard-educated African-American who had some experience on the national political scene,\u201d said Steven J. Rauschenberger, a Republican who was then a member of the Illinois State Senate. \u201cWe need that because the Democrats have made an icon out of Barack Obama.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Having seen their icon thrashed in 2004, in 2009 conservatives looked to Michael Steele, the first African-American to head the Republican National Convention, to face off with the first black president. But Steele had an on-again off-again relationship with the party line, and was thus ill suited to be a Conservative Black Hope, even if the hip-hop Republican often talked like one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 2010, Allen West, a congressman from Florida, arrived promising to lead black people off the Obama plantation like a \u201cmodern-day Harriet Tubman.\u201d More like Harriet Miers; West was defeated in the very next election.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 2012, Herman Cain took up the cape and cowl, proclaiming that the first black president had \u201cnever been part of the black experience in America\u201d and insisting that Obama was \u201cnot a strong black man.\u201d But Cain was not a strong presidential candidate, and the wait for the Conservative Black Hope continued. Things were looking up at the Conservative Political Action Conference this year when a black Republican, K. Carl Smith, ran a session for attendees who were \u201ctired of being called a racist.\u201d Among those answering in the affirmative was a man who proceeded to defend slavery.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not all black conservatives see it as their job to tell white racists that they embody the dreams of Martin Luther King Jr. It is certainly possible to oppose Obamacare in good conscience. No one knows this more than Ben Carson. In the late 1980s and early \u201990s, he may have been the most celebrated figure in the black communities of Baltimore. Carson responded to that adulation by regularly giving his time to talk to young people, who needed to know that there was so much more beyond the streets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was one of those young people. I don\u2019t doubt that Carson was a conservative even then. I knew plenty of black people who loved their community and hated welfare. But white conservatives were never interested in them, and they were never as interested in Ben Carson as they are right now. When the presidency was an unbroken string of white men, there were no calls for him to run for the White House. And then he put on the mask.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ta-Nehisi Coates, a senior editor at The Atlantic, is a guest columnist.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/419126476.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>A NEEDLESS CONFLICT IN FLORIDA</h2<p>One of the most valuable lessons in office politics goes like this: If you want to convince someone of the worthiness of your idea, convince them that it was really their idea in the first place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Florida Gov. Jeb Bush failed to follow that advice when he announced plans a few months ago to replace his state's race-based affirmative action programs. Now--Surprise! Surprise!--his plans have run into a political buzz saw.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Black students, politicians and civil rights leaders have responded with outrage. The very controversy Bush hoped to avoid has landed at his doorstep quite literally when state Sen. Kendrick Meek, a black Miami Democrat, staged a sit-in at Bush's executive offices. Public hearings around the state have turned into raucous shouting matches with enormous turnouts. At least two key lawmakers, Senate Majority Leader Jack Latvala of Palm Harbor and state Rep. Rudy Bradley, a St. Petersburg Republican, have suggested the governor may need to slow down his initiative for more meetings and consideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All of this fuss was kicked up, ironically enough, by an idea that actually could result in an increase in minority enrollment in the state's universities, if Florida follows the patterns of similar post- affirmative action plans in Texas and California.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bush's plan would replace the old system, which has awarded extra credit to black and Hispanic college applicants for being black or Hispanic, with a new system that would make the top 20 percent of graduates in each Florida high school eligible for state university admission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Black and Hispanic students tend to be enrolled disproportionately in low-performing high schools; therefore, Bush's plan could result in a larger enrollment of minorities than the current race-based system if colleges also use need, income, geographic diversity and other factors as substitutes for race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Contrast Jeb's plight to the success of his governor brother. Texas Gov. George W. Bush dodged a similar controversy when he implemented a similar measure last year for the top 10 percent of his state's graduates. Unlike in Florida, the Texas plan was initiated after affirmative action in college admissions was outlawed by a federal court order. Instead of it being imposed on black and Hispanic legislators, they conceived it and passed it with the help of white allies, particularly from rural districts whose low-income students also have benefited.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>California's governor is pushing a similar 4-percent plan to bring more minorities into its two most selective universities, Berkeley and UCLA, in the wake of the anti-affirmative action Proposition 209.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unlike in Texas and California, Florida's affirmative action programs have not been outlawed by vote or court order--yet. Forces affiliated with Ward Connerly, who spearheaded California's successful Proposition 209, are trying to pass a similar proposition in Florida, where opinion polls indicate it would pass.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since that fight is just getting started, Jeb Bush's critics wondered quite reasonably why he was rushing to eliminate the programs now. They further resented the possibility that Jeb might be rushing to end affirmative action to give a boost to his brother's presidential bid.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a result, the fight to preserve affirmative action has become so polarized that some people, particularly the young, are embracing a tragically misguided argument: that blacks and Latinos cannot succeed if they don't receive some extra points for being black or Latino.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, at a recent Broward County meeting, where protesters tried to shout down a speech by Connerly, one protester, a black 13- year-old girl told a reporter, \"If we don't have affirmative action, probably the only job we would have would be a janitor . . . or maids.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not true. California, for example, has had a systemwide increase in minority enrollments after Proposition 209, thanks to improved efforts to recruit minority applicants. Texas also has had an increase in minority enrollments at its two most selective public universities, the University of Texas and Texas A&M.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good politics, after all, is the art of compromise. Had Jeb Bush jawboned with black and Hispanic leaders first, before dropping his hot potato in their laps, he might have avoided this headache. All Bush had to do was convince his adversaries that his idea was really their idea in the first place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In many ways, it was, which only compounds the tragedy of the current impasse. Bush's espoused goals--equal opportunity and academic excellence for all, regardless of race, religion or ethnicity--are essentially the same as those promoted by black and Latino leaders. But those positive messages have gotten drowned out in the din of racial suspicions and resentment. Florida's leaders, like those in the rest of the country, need to talk to each other more. They need to listen to each other, too.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>E-mail: Cptime@aol.com</p>\n"}

Now the L.A. Democrat is showing he also can play a good game--he and other key legislators as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Two major education issues now nearing final resolution in the Legislature--charter schools and bilingual ed--illustrate the difference between excelling at the game and just fumbling along, between seizing the lead and awkwardly playing catch-up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, listen to the speaker:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"One of my responsibilities is to fix problems,\" he tells me. \"People want us to fix things. There's no question that if we don't start to restore the people's confidence in our ability to resolve the salient issues facing California, they're increasingly going to drop out and be frustrated and use the initiative process. The Legislature will become irrelevant to them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"If we're going to survive . . . we've got to get beyond what we're against and identify what we're for.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Easily said. Hard to do--at least in a term-limited Legislature when leaders are short-timers and their strengths suspect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fixing things--getting beyond merely running a demolition derby--requires compromise. Often that means saying no to favorite special interests. And that's how the game just was played concerning charter schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Key legislators--working with the governor's office, the California Teachers Assn. and Silicon Valley political activists--quickly reached agreement on a bill to allow significant expansion of the number of charter schools in the state. These schools are becoming increasingly popular because government has less control over them, and parents and teachers have more. The bill is expected to win final passage today in both houses and be signed by Gov. Pete Wilson. And that will avoid a bruising initiative fight.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A high-tech coalition, headed by software entrepreneur Reed Hastings, spent $3 million to collect 1.2 million signatures to qualify its initiative for the November ballot. It also gave the Legislature until Friday to negotiate an alternative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"We're going to have a big bonfire with the 1.2 million signatures,\" Hastings says. \"But the $3 million was well spent, because we were planning on a $15-million initiative campaign.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Villaraigosa played a very important role,\" Hastings adds. \"He was a real catalyst. Instead of being angry with us for promoting an initiative, he took the attitude that 'You guys must really be frustrated.' \"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indeed, the high-tech gurus are very frustrated with California's public school system. They're now also talking about sponsoring an initiative in 2000 to lower the vote requirement for local school bond issues from two-thirds to a simple majority.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To achieve the compromise, Villaraigosa, a former L.A. teachers union leader, had to deny the CTA what it was demanding: a collective bargaining guarantee for charter school teachers. That issue will be left to each school. But the CTA got the expansion of charter schools limited to 100 a year.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren played \"a strong, courageous role,\" Hastings says, by endorsing the initiative in February. \"That helped give us early credibility. If not for Dan Lungren, this bill would not have come together.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He also credits Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-Santa Barbara) and the bill's author, Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Carlos).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Notes Lempert: \"This is how the process should work.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Compare that, however, to past Assembly bumbling over a bilingual bill. Granted, bilingual education is a much more emotional issue. But when Democrats--led by Latinos--balked at reform last year, it gave wealthy computer whiz Ron Unz the opening to qualify his Prop. 227 for the June 2 ballot. The measure would virtually eliminate bilingual ed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Villaraigosa, who wasn't speaker during last year's bilingual ed brouhaha, finally rammed an alternative bill through the Assembly on April 20. His message to reluctant Democrats: In the past, they also looked like the proverbial deer in the headlights on illegal immigration and affirmative action--and remember how voters reacted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The bilingual ed bill, authored by Sen. Dede Alpert (D-Coronado), emphasizes local control, in contrast to Unz's one-size-fits-all approach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Alpert hopes to win final Senate passage Monday. Wilson may sign the bill and also endorse Prop. 227. But he's not sure. What the governor really wanted was for the Legislature to waylay the Unz initiative last year. Now it's a big favorite to pass--bill or no bill.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As Villaraigosa knows, it's how legislators play the game--not talk it--that instills voter confidence and elicits cheers.

Surely after another quarter-century of progress in racial relations, \"the use of racial preferences,\" as Justice O'Connor wrote, \"will no longer be necessary.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That was 11 years ago. Given the loathsome racism exposed in the past few days, it's harder to be sanguine about that quarter-century. First it was Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, whose lawbreaking was being celebrated by Republican senators Rand Paul (Ky.) and Dean Heller (Nev.) until Mr. Bundy began extolling the virtues of slavery for African Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then came the taped remarks ostensibly of basketball team owner Donald Sterling chastising his girlfriend for associating with African Americans: \"It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?\" In a curious response, Mr. Sterling and his Los Angeles Clippers organization said they \"do not know\" if the tape is \"legitimate\" but that Mr. Sterling \"feels terrible that such sentiments are being attributed to him.\" As Post columnist Sally Jenkins and others have pointed out, this is not the first time that offensive comments have been \"attributed to\" Mr. Sterling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whenever such ugly sentiments surface, many white Americans who like to think that the country has moved beyond rank racism profess astonishment. Many black Americans see in that astonishment proof of the obtuseness, willful or otherwise, that prevents whites from acknowledging the obstacles African Americans still face. Optimists in this case might note that Mr. Bundy (age 67) and Mr. Sterling (80) are of a generation that Justice O'Connor expected would be gone from the scene by her deadline. Yet even optimists have to be dispirited by the revelation of such casually accepted racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Two data points don't prove Justice O'Connor wrong, nor do they make a definitive case for or against affirmative action. They do, however, take us back to the rationale for diversity that Justice O'Connor was defending in 2003. To consign Bundy-style ignorance to history, the country needs younger people of all races interacting, including in law schools (the subject of the 2003 case) and other educational venues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the justice wrote then, in Grutter v. Bollinger: \"The Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on 'any belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue.' To the contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law School's mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students. Just as growing up in a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to affect an individual's views, so too is one's own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still matters.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Only 14 years to go, and Justice O'Connor's observation seems no less true.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}

Many of these items were unique: Extremely rare Egyptian mummies; some of the oldest human remains of the Americas; cultural collections of indigenous peoples (both from today and from pre-conquest times); African treasures, such as the throne of King Adandozan of Dahome, and rare ivory sculptures. There were also collections of coral, fish, mammals, insects, birds, reptiles and plants. Many of these species, such as the blue Spix Macaw (featured in Disney's animated film \"Rio\"), are now extinct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The museum was used by people of all kinds, from students of Rio de Janeiro's cash-strapped public schools to world-class international scientific researchers. The museum was also a first-rate educational center, teaching graduate students in many disciplines. Its anthropology program, of which I once was director, celebrated its 50th anniversary this year and is internationally known for its excellence. The scientific professionals we train can be found in universities and laboratories worldwide.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For Brazil's indigenous peoples, devastated by colonization and genocide, and for African Brazilians, whose ancestors were brought here in chains, the museum was a concrete link to the past and a resource for building a better future. There, it was believed, indigenous and black cultural history would be protected and employed in the creation of these peoples' own museums, which are now beginning to proliferate in Brazil. The National Museum and its researchers were seen as allies in these projects, helping traditionally oppressed Brazilian peoples to safeguard their heritage and construct a better world for their children.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Working with indigenous groups, the museum's anthropology department produced videos and CDs documenting cultural practices and African Brazilian and indigenous religious music. The museum trained indigenous museologists and video producers, working with them to build Native heritage centers, such as the Mag\u00fcta Museum on the Upper Solim\u00f5es and the Kuikuro Center at Ipatse Village on the Upper Xingu River. The museum's ethnologists helped native and African Brazilian groups document, map and survey their lands. Its linguists worked to recover and teach lost or almost-lost tongues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most importantly, in its many graduate studies programs, the museum employed affirmative action policies to recruit native and African Brazilians from traditional communities. It trained them as scientists who would work to research and reflect with their peoples on their contemporary communities and how they were constantly and dynamically transforming themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All of this now lies in ashes, leaving us with a cooling ruin and the immense archaeological labor of sifting through the debris to see what is left.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The destruction of the museum and its collections threatens Brazil's ethnic minorities. We no longer have the audio recordings of hundreds of dialects and languages spoken by native speakers who knew no other tongue \u2014 the raw material for the construction of lexicons, dictionaries and indigenous-language textbooks. The vast collections of cultural artifacts, which could be loaned to indigenous and quilombola cultural centers to give children the precious, absolutely irreplaceable sense of their peoples' historical significance, have been wiped out. But we take immense heart in the messages of support that are pouring in from our indigenous allies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ironically, after five years of negotiations, this year the Brazilian National Bank for Social and Economic Development authorized resources to the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (to which the museum is institutionally linked) for new buildings to house our technical reserves, laboratories and graduate courses. This would have allowed us to move out of the Imperial Palace that was the heart of our institution, reforming it as a dedicated display area. We had many plans. We were celebrating the museum's 200th anniversary. We were going to build new structures and rebuild the old. We planned to create safeguards against human and natural disasters. We were working on inaugurating new exhibits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The fiery holocaust that consumed the National Museum occurred in the midst of Brazil's polarized presidential campaign. The reactions to the disaster by the current government and many of the candidates for the presidency have laid bare for the world to see the indifference of an administrative elite that understands its roll to be the sale of Brazil to the highest bidder. It is spotlighting, on a global stage, the rancorous idiocy of a large portion of our upper-middle classes, who seem to be incapable of distinguishing a cut-rate Orlando factory outlet from the Louvre or the Smithsonian Institution. It is showcasing, planetwide, the chuckle-headed imbecility of certain local leaders who blandly reassure us that the 20 million objects lost in the flames can be simply and quickly remade.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We now face the task of constructing a new museum, free of internal and external colonial thinking. We must do this for those who are our truest allies: the world's scientists, who seek to know and preserve the richness and diversity of humanity and the planet, and, most importantly, the indigenous and minority peoples of Brazil and the world, who fight for recognition of their rights and identities. Our native partners are demanding that we talk of reconstruction and not of annihilation. Daily, they remind us of the most important lesson they have learned over the past 526 years: Either we look to the future or we will not exist. We must change, build and grow. This is our response, as scientists and human beings, to the stunningly unequal society that surrounds us, which we will work to transcend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Read more:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We're all in danger of watching our history go up in flames</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By Antonio Carlos de Souza Lima</p>\n"}

But the outrage factor is major, especially at UC Berkeley, with highly qualified applicants shunted aside to make room for those who apparently did not belong at the school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of the 64, 22 were side-door applicants involved in the now-familiar Varsity Blues scandal, in which non-athletes were recommended by coaches who had been bribed by the families via an unscrupulous Newport Beach college consultant, or similar but legal situations in which donations got them in the door. They were accepted at Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But 42 more -- all of them Berkeley applicants -- weren't athletes. They simply had some form of extraordinary privilege. Some were the offspring of parents who made big donations. Others had connections, family or otherwise, to campus staff, leaders or donors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, most were white and well-off financially. And they were far from the best applicants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"These applicants were less qualified than many others for whom the campuses denied admission,\" the audit said. \"In fact, some of these applicants received the lowest possible scores on their applications.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The audit includes a graphic showing the outcomes for two white students who had benefited from their connections. Evaluators of their applications had recommended rejecting them, but they were accepted anyway. Meanwhile, a student of color who had been recommended for acceptance was rejected.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among the less-qualified students who were accepted: the babysitter for a colleague of the former director of undergraduate admissions. The child of a prominent alumnus. The child of a high-level university staffer. Two children of donors. In addition, the audit said, a former UC Berkeley admissions director openly invited faculty and staff to suggest the names of offspring of their family and friends for her to review personally.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This scandal helps make the case for Proposition 16, which would reinstate California's ability to use affirmative action. Merit has never been the only factor in college admissions. Opponents of Proposition 16 weren't objecting when it was white students who were given an extra leg up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Make no mistake, at private colleges, students often are accepted because they have connections or parents who make big donations. Just having a parent who is an alumnus gives applicants a significant boost, a practice known as legacy admissions. But that isn't supposed to happen at California's public universities, paid for in part by taxpayers, with policies that call for fair, merit-based admission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In fairness, the number of improperly accepted students is barely a blip. Berkeley admits about 14,000 freshmen a year. But at a time when the fairness of college admissions is under new scrutiny, it is galling to see privilege prevail over merit at a campus known for its commitment to social justice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The worst example of all, though, involves not just Berkeley officials but also an unnamed UC regent. Regents are allowed to write standard letters of recommendation for applicants but otherwise aren't supposed to try to influence admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this case, the regent sent the letter not as part of the regular admissions process, but to the chancellor's office, after a certain less-qualified student had been wait-listed. The student's family were friends with the regent. The chancellor's office forwarded the letter to the development office, which should have nothing to do with admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No matter how few applicants were admitted via their connections, Cal clearly has fed a system of ethical sloppiness. UC's internal reviews failed to find as many cases of admissions wrongdoing as the state audit. The university has put new admissions safeguards into place, but the issue here is more one of a problematic culture than a lack of rules. There were already rules in place for some of these situations; they simply weren't followed. UC needs regular reviews of admissions practices, which should be conducted by external entities that aren't beholden to the university.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here's one rule we propose: No involvement of regents in the application process, including writing even regular letters of recommendation. The regents are simply too influential as well as the ultimate bosses of admissions officers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And any regents who break the rules should be named publicly.

By further increasing the difficulties of investing in Ulster, they risk more of the poverty that breeds the discrimination they deplore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ulster's Catholic minority does suffer economic discrimination at the hands of the Protestant majority. But discrimination is not a governmental tool of repression, as in South Africa. The British authorities in Northern Ireland prohibited discrimination in hiring 10 years ago and are struggling to enforce the law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even so, American partisans of Ulster Catholics want the 26 American subsidiaries there to observe the so-called MacBride Principles, fashioned after the Sullivan Principles for American companies in South Africa. Named for Sean MacBride, a former Irish diplomat who had a hand in their formulation, the rules urge a kind of affirmative action for Catholics, with implied hiring quotas, which are formally prohibited by fair employment laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>American admirers of these rules want laws that fire across the bow of companies judged remiss in obeying them. Though they do not yet call for disinvestment, that is the threat. The New York bill now on Governor Cuomo's desk ''encourages'' the State Comptroller to consider a company's compliance before purchasing its stock with pension funds.

Harder, yes, but not impossible, for the Court once again has struck down one affirmative action plan while announcing rules by which others may survive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has made it harder for states and cities to give minorities an edge in competing for public works contracts that long went only to whites. Harder, yes, but not impossible, for the Court once again has struck down one affirmative action plan while announcing rules by which others may survive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Following a pattern set by the Federal Government with the Court's blessing, Richmond, Va., required its public contractors to set aside a fixed percentage of its subcontracting for minorities. But the Court now says states and localities have a much heavier burden than the Federal Government to prove that these set-asides do not discriminate racially - against whites.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Richmond, once the seat of Confederate power and white supremacy, enacted the set-asides in 1983 with the help of a black City Council majority. The action frightened some whites and judges who saw a new regime of racial bias with the labels reversed. The Council erred tactically by pegging the set-aside at 30 percent, compared with the Federal 10 percent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Council also copied, too casually, the Federal pattern of classifying Eskimos and Aleuts among the beneficiaries, exposing Richmond to the Court's ridicule and skepticism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Richmond now learns that its remedial powers are vastly inferior to those of the Federal Government. The Court reaffirms that Congress, under its authority to enforce the 14th Amendment, may establish set-asides in Federal programs. Local governments, meanwhile, bound literally by that same amendment's equal protection clause, may do so only after overcoming judicial suspicions of reverse racial discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To do that, cities and states must avoid rigid quotas and link any numerical goal precisely to the proportion of qualified contractors. And to prove that the set-asides are remedies for past discrimination, local governments must revisit that sorry past and demonstrate their responsibility for it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's a heavy cost. The Court was more statesmanlike when now-retired Justice Lewis Powell held the balance of voting power. When the Court struck down a quota system in the Bakke case a decade ago, he made clear that a state medical school could pursue diversity in its student body without confessing to past racial discrimination. His vote in another major case two years ago made it easier for states to increase hiring of women without confessing past sex bias.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The present Court may have a majority eager to assume that the nation is color-blind well before racial equality has become real. It is one thing to wish for that and to resist any need to classify Americans by race. But as Justice Thurgood Marshall charged in his dissent, the majority is ''constitutionalizing its wishful thinking'' by applying color-blind rules. The result is that Richmond's remedies receive the same suspicious scrutiny the Court once applied to Virginia's massive resistance to school desegregation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Wishful thinking notwithstanding, the Richmond decision leaves room for affirmative action that is carefully constructed. And affirmative action thrives in the private sector; companies have told the Court that diversity is good business and good citizenship. The ground rules are tighter now but the struggle for racial equality continues.</p>\n"}

Bollinger.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But, of course, O'Connor is now retired from the court, replaced by Samuel A. Alito Jr., a justice far more skeptical of racial remedies. And two recent decisions in lower courts have raised the prospect that the issue will return to the high court far ahead of O'Connor's timeline.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One is from Texas, where a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a race-conscious admissions policy at the University of Texas at Austin. An attempt to have the entire circuit hear the case failed 9 to 7, and dissenters practically invited the Supreme Court to step in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other is from Michigan, where voters in 2006 passed a constitutional amendment to forbid the state's public colleges and universities from granting \"preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit ruled 2 to 1 that the amendment violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it restructures the state's political structure to the detriment of minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) on Friday asked the full circuit to review the decision, and said that the Supreme Court would be the next stop if he is unsuccessful with the circuit court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"It's absurd to conclude that banning racial discrimination somehow perpetuates racial discrimination,\" Schuette said in announcing his plans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The decisions focus renewed attention on the court's controversial pair of decisions in June 2003 regarding racial preference programs at the University of Michigan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>InGratz v. Bollinger, the court ruled 6 to 3 that the university's undergraduate admissions policy was unconstitutionally discriminatory because it automatically awarded a bonus to applicants who were underrepresented minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But in Grutter, the court upheld the law school's policy of considering race as part of a holistic evaluation of an applicant. O'Connor said government had a compelling interest in diversity, including seeking a \"critical mass\" of minority students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The combination of rulings seem to allow colleges and universities to approve the consideration of race if the policy, among other things, is narrowly tailored, free of quotas, flexible and individualized, does not award points simply on the basis of race and is limited in duration, or at least periodically reviewed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Texas case,Fisher v. University of Texas, is the farthest along. Washington lawyer Bert W. Rein, who represents Abigail Fisher and Rachel Michalewicz, two students who said UT's policy discriminated against them, has until mid-September to file a petition with the Supreme Court asking for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rein has argued that the use of race is unnecessary, because UT has in place a race-neutral admissions policy that already results in percentages of minority students \"far beyond\" the numbers at issue in Grutter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Texas law provides that graduates in the top 10 percent of their Texas high school be automatically admitted to any state university. They account for the vast majority of UT freshman classes, and Rein said 30 percent of the enrolling students are from underrepresented minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But UT officials do not feel that is enough for a state in which - in the near future - there will be no majority race. In evaluating applicants not in the top 10, it decided after Grutter to consider race along with a number of other factors, such as community service, leadership qualities, test scores and work experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The panel said such a plan satisfied the court's standards set in Grutter. But other judges in the circuit disagreed. Chief Judge Edith H. Jones wrote that the panel's deference to university officials and talk of classroom diversity are not what Supreme Court precedent demands; instead, they are \"misguided and pernicious to the goal of eventually ending racially conscious programs.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Civil rights groups get nervous when such cases arise before the reconstituted Roberts Court. NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund President John A. Payton hopes Texas's unique system makes it a bad fit for a high court review of race-conscious programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I don't think the court is looking to overturn Grutter,\" he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But Jennifer Gratz disagrees. She was the named plaintiff in one of the 2003 cases. She won the battle in her own case only to lose the war in the other. She now works for the American Civil Rights Institute in California, where she directs state efforts at removing racial preferences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"At some point, the split in Gratz and Grutter will have to end up back at the Supreme Court,\" she said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>barnesr@washpost.com</p>\n"}

Now, U.S. presidents (and their wives) are among the most photographed people on the planet, supplanting most traditional reasons for painting a world leader's likeness in the first place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On Tuesday, his-and-her painted portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama, commissioned by the Smithsonian Institution, went on public view at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. They cheerfully buck the official portrait trend of instantly forgettable painterly pablum.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His was painted by L.A.-born, New York-based Kehinde Wiley, 40; hers was painted by Baltimore-based Amy Sherald, 44, who was born in Columbus, Georgia. These are not the official portraits that will some day hang in the White House but a separate set -- his destined for the gallery's permanent \"Hall of Presidents\" display, hers for the museum's collection.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like almost everyone, I've seen only the paintings in reproduction, which isn't really good enough for a full accounting. Reproductions don't convey accurate color or texture, and they erase the essential dynamism of scale. (The president's canvas is 7 feet tall, which suggests a certain larger-than-life environment in relation to a viewer.) Paintings also live or die on surface qualities of reflected light, while reproductions are today typically juiced by light projected through the image on a mobile or desktop digital screen.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reproductions peel off a painting's complex formalism, leaving behind composition and iconography as the bare bones with which to read the work as a disembodied image. Wiley and Sherald had a lot to work with in that regard. They're the first African American artists to receive such a commission, and they are representing the first African Americans to occupy the White House -- which was built with slave labor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The dress in Sherald's portrait of the former first lady, whose wardrobe during her White House tenure was carefully watched for its fresh and distinctly contemporary style, was always going to be a lightning rod. Astutely, the artist made it a centerpiece.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The halter-top dress is by American designer Michelle Smith of the label, Milly, whose clothes have often been worn by Obama. For the seated portrait, the dress forms a voluminous white mountain, on top of which Michelle Obama's exposed arms, shoulders and elegantly posed head, hair loose and unfurled, securely rest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unsmiling, she looks you squarely in the eye.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Her skin is depicted in Sherald's trademark gray-scale -- a device reminiscent of black-and-white photography that the artist has long used for portraiture. The aim is to \"exclude the idea of color as race,\" she has said. In the Obama portrait, color is located most effusively in the sky-blue field in which the \"mountain\" resides. Obama is at once Olympian and down to earth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Color also erupts in the geometric patterns that decorate the dress, which the designer has been quick to note is not couture. (Forget velvet or brocade; the material is stretch cotton.) The black-and-white patterns do recall the famous quilt designs produced by generations of African American women in the Alabama hamlet of Gee's Bend, as Sherald has also said. But the repeated pattern of multicolored horizontal bars also evokes the radical 1920s textiles of German Bauhaus artist, Anni Albers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Albers, like other women of her day, was kept from becoming a painter, so she channeled her extraordinary talents into revolutionizing woven fabrics. Obama is wrapped in -- and lofted by -- imagery created by pioneering women.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Wiley embeds the president, dressed in a casual Friday dark suit with an open-collar white shirt, within a vertical field of bright green foliage dotted with red, gold, orange and violet flowers. The design may be simple realism, but it ricochets between royal tapestry and homey wallpaper, which the artist has used in other paintings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Leaves coil around the president's feet, cushioning the legs of the refined, antique wooden chair on which he sits. The president leans forward slightly, arms loosely crossed on his knees.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Surely the composition nods to the seated portrait of Abraham Lincoln by George P.A. Healy, the most celebrated (if now little known) American portraitist of the Civil War era. In 1868, Healy rendered Lincoln's posthumous portrait in a history painting, \"The Peacemakers,\" showing a crucial meeting in Richmond, Va., with Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman and Admiral David Dixon Porter during the war's final days. With a sentimental flourish typical of its day, the artist added an optimistic rainbow outside the window framing Lincoln's head.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Healy painted more than one version of the scene, attesting to the work's popularity, as well as a separate Lincoln portrait seated in the same wooden chair. Obama installed one of them, acquired in 1947 for the White House art collection, in the Oval Office dining room.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like the first lady in Sherald's painting, the president in Wiley's does not smile, instead offering a penetrating stare. Obama, the veritable picture of self-restraint, is a New Adam in a lush and visually tumultuous modern Eden.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Wiley's work often makes fun of the overblown pomp-and-circumstance of European Old Master art. This painting is certainly vivid and unusual, but he's toned it down from the florid regalia of uniformed pageantry his portraits often employ. He has identified the flowers in his landscape as symbols of places meaningful to the president -- Hawaii (jasmine), Kenya (African lilies) and Chicago (chrysanthemums, the city's official flower).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Racists on social media have been quick to decry the artists as \"affirmative action\" hires, a repulsive if unsurprising slur in our reactionary period of white backlash. Even some mainstream outlets, such as the Hollywood news and gossip site the Wrap, have gone for inflammatory clickbait, trolling the artists and courting dwellers in the alt-right fever-swamp.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Needless to say, Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, didn't suffer the same assault when he chose Robert Anderson, a Yale classmate and bland Connecticut portraitist, for his nondescript likeness. (Anderson's pastel illustrations have appeared in print advertising for Breck shampoo.) Kimberly Drew, social media manager at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, aptly noted on Twitter ( @museummammy) that both Wiley and Obama have dedicated their careers to \"revising how the world sees black people\" -- a project that certainly riles the insecure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Out across the land, a culture war is raging. It's the source of the unprecedented public response to this Smithsonian commission, which far surpasses the unveiling of any presidential portrait before it. Even in reproductions it's easy -- and encouraging -- to see that the Obamas, Wiley and Sherald have not shied away.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the White House, the Obamas were the first of their kind. At the Smithsonian, the artists are the first of their kind. And in the annals of official American portraiture, these paintings are the first of their kind. They will not be the last.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>christopher.knight@latimes.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Twitter: @KnightLAT</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: PHOTO: IN THIS PORTRAIT, which was recently unveiled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, Michelle Obama is \"at once Olympian and down to earth.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTOGRAPHER:Mark Wilson Getty Images</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTO:KEHINDE Wiley and Amy Sherald were the first African Americans to get this kind of commission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTOGRAPHER:Matt McClain Washington Post</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTO:THE FLOWERS in this painting of Barack Obama, at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, symbolize locations important to the former president.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTOGRAPHER:Mark Wilson Getty Images</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: ART CRITIC</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1113809600.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Balancing act</h2<p>With his eye on the much-coveted female voter, Mitt Romney proudly brandished his pro-woman credentials in Tuesday night's presidential debate, recounting his vigorous efforts to hire women as members of his Cabinet when he was governor of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How did he do it? Two strategies: First, a little old-fashioned affirmative action (that is, faced with too few female applicants and a desire for women in the workplace, he put together binders of female candidates and considered them separately) and, second, flex-time policies that allowed mothers to work and still get home to be with their children.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Romney is to be commended for his understanding that flex-time policies are a crucial feature of any modern workplace ready to acknowledge the myriad complications involved in combining work outside the home with work inside the home. But all voters -- women and men -- should ask themselves why candidates for office still assume that only women need such policies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Time and again, we send women the message that Gov. Romney sent them Tuesday night: Work-family balance is your struggle alone. Silently, this sends men an equally clear message: You can stay at work all night because no one expects you to be home for bath time or dinnertime or homework time or bedtime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As an academic and as a mother, I'm all too familiar with these sex-differentiated messages. They account for the disproportionate amount of childcare done by mothers, even mothers in two-career families, as scholarly research has shown. Likewise, in my own life, they account for why so many people seem shocked when my husband misses work to volunteer at our children's school, where he is showered with praise for taking on projects that are often handled by working moms without anyone noticing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The message Mitt Romney sent to voters in Tuesday's debate is not new, nor is it a peculiar product of Romney's own rarefied work experiences. For much of our nation's history, laws regulating family and employment granted different rights to women and men at home and at work. The so-called maternal difficulty -- that is, the supposed incompatibility between women's biology and certain roles in the workplace and public life -- held that women were best suited to the home, allowing men to flourish at work. As Supreme Court Justice Joseph P. Bradley explained in 1872, rejecting the argument that the Constitution protected a woman's right to be a lawyer, the \"paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Such explicit accounts of biological sex differences and their consequences are now the stuff of legal history. But we still let employers and politicians tell women it is their unique challenge to make their home and workplace responsibilities compatible with each other. Today, we encourage women to work outside the home, but only if they can figure out how to care for their kids too. In so doing, implicitly, we still tell fathers and fathers-to-be that their responsibilities at home have no relevance to their roles at work. Flex-time policies are, thus, thought to be an issue for female workers and female voters alone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unlike in Bradley's day, though, it is now hard to offer any clear, persuasive, legally acceptable justification for such different expectations for mothers and fathers at work and at home. The \"maternal difficulty\" narrative just doesn't cut it in 2012.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Shifting age-old norms like these is no easy feat. To be sure, the law can help. In 2003, for example, the Supreme Court, in an opinion written by the conservative former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, observed that policies that gave parental leave to women only \"were not attributable to any differential physical needs of men and women, but rather to the pervasive sex-role stereotype that caring for family members is women's work.\" The Supreme Court has come a long way since Bradley.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But this is not just a project for the courts. We need to begin to push our leaders, in workplaces and government, to abandon their antiquated assumptions about men's and women's roles at work and at home. We need to send a clear message to candidates for office that creating a work-family balance can't be accomplished by mothers alone. And we need all voters to realize that for people lucky enough to have children and jobs outside of their homes, combining these parts of their lives is a unique challenge of parenthood, not just of motherhood.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Ariela R.

Harriet Beecher Stowe's book was fiction, but it was based on life in this cabin and the cruel reality of human bondage in Rockville before the Civil War.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Historic markers also point out various stations along the Underground Railroad, which many slaves used in their heroic trek toward freedom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Inside the F. Scott Fitzgerald Theatre at Rockville Civic Center Park, hundreds of people gathered to celebrate how far we have come.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But there was also uneasiness in the air, the likes of which many residents had not felt in years. With the new Bush administration has come what sounded to many like an outright fondness for -- of all things -- the Old Confederacy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Opposition to affirmative action was one thing. But the romanticized harking back to the days of slavery by two prominent Bush Cabinet designees had caught some off guard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After marveling at the harmonious and beautifully integrated audience, Rockville Mayor Rose G. Krasnow told me, \"I hope I can still feel this good at Martin Luther King Day a year from now.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Krasnow, who is white and a Democrat, was a high school student in Memphis in 1968, the year King was killed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"How well I remember,\" she told the audience, adding that she hoped Rockville would remain in the forefront of efforts by cities to end racism in America.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.) attended the celebration along with Minnie Anderson, one of her top assistants. Morella had co-sponsored legislation calling for a memorial to King to be erected on the Tidal Basin between the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This had been done at the urging of the Montgomery County chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., a national service organization to which King belonged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Martin Luther King formulated a revolution that resonated from the Supreme Court to the Oval Office,\" she said. \"What he did in his own quiet, nonviolent way was to show us how to replace hatred and bigotry with love and peaceful resistance.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I took that as a quiet call to arms against extremists everywhere  -- including those in her own party.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This was Rockville's 29th celebration of King Day, another indication that the city has long been one of the more progressive in the nation. Both Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery in Baltimore, and Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery on the Eastern Shore near Cambridge, are said to have used safe houses in Rockville during their efforts to abolish slavery and free others.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The city's tribute made clear that this history had not been forgotten, nor would the progress be taken for granted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An African American drumming group, Soul in Motion, kicked off the event with a ceremonial conjuring of the African motherland. The primal call of the drums made nearly everyone clap, joyfully revealing our commonality as human beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lynn Perry Parker, chairman of the Rockville Human Rights Commission, noted that the commission seeks to make people aware that discrimination by race, sex, age and disability still exists, and that government help is available to combat it. Geraldine Payton- Brown, with Daryl Davis on piano, sang moving renditions of \"Amazing Grace\" and \"Walk With Thee,\" while the Faith Community Gospel Choir followed up with \"Total Praise.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These songs made clear the essential role of faith in the African American struggle for freedom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Young people were the highlight of the program.

And the National Association of Black Journalists called Mr. Holt's new role \"thrilling\" and \"historic\" in a statement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But few news reports mentioned or did more than give a passing reference to the pioneering journalist who predated Mr. Holt in the anchor's chair: Max Robinson, who died in 1988 from complications of AIDS. He was the first African-American to co-anchor the news on a national network, on \"ABC World News Tonight,\" more than 35 years ago.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With his elegant three-piece suits, close-cropped Afro and buttery announcer's voice, Mr. Robinson was a model of on-air cool in the 1970s, when the nation was debating affirmative action and redefining societal norms in the wake of the civil rights movement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Robinson, then in his 30s, seemed like the right man for the time. He was a highly regarded local newscaster in Washington, D.C., college-educated and with strong views about racism and equality. But he was not so outspoken that he would offend ABC's mainstream audience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"It was a breakthrough,\" said Clarence Page, a Chicago Tribune columnist friendly with Mr. Robinson who was hired to help him write his autobiography. (It was never published.) \"Max helped open the door for a lot of other journalists,\" Mr. Page said, including, he added, Mr. Holt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But being in the vanguard came at a price. Though the African-Americans Carole Simpson, Russ Mitchell and Mr. Holt later served as weekend anchors, the daily news business in Mr. Robinson's era was predominately male and white, fueling Mr. Robinson's concerns about racism. He never quite fit into the clubby, competitive culture of network television.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And Mr. Robinson struggled with alcoholism, his at-times unpredictable behavior aggravating challenges in his personal and professional life and making him a complicated figure in a way that some other well-known \"firsts,\" like Jackie Robinson and Sandra Day O'Connor, were not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Lester Holt is in a more enviable position than Max,\" said Barbara Matusow, a journalist and author of \"The Evening Stars,\" a behind-the-scenes look at network news. \"Everyone is pulling for Lester Holt. That wasn't the case for Max Robinson.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Robinson was born in Richmond, Va., in 1939, the second of four children whose father, Maxie, was a teacher and sports coach celebrated in their community. Richmond was segregated then, and Mr. Robinson's younger brother, Randall, a civil rights activist and author, said: \"When we'd board buses, we had to walk to the back of the bus. To buy Chinese food we had to go to the back door.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Robinson attended Oberlin College. (He did not graduate, said his brother.) And their parents instilled in them a sense of cultural pride. \"Max wasn't going to change who he was,\" nor obscure it, said the columnist Mr. Page.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1959, Mr. Robinson was hired to read the news at a TV station in Portsmouth, Va. He was not allowed to show his face, though, and was hidden behind a screen with the station's logo. \"One day Max instructed the people to take the screen down,\" his brother said, so the audience could see him. He was fired the next day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Robinson moved to Washington and, in 1966, appeared as a guest on \"Meet the Press.\" \"I remember seeing his head and thinking: 'Oh, my God. Max is on national television,' \" Randall Robinson said. \"We lit up the family telephone circuit.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Three years later, he became the first African-American co-anchor at WTOP in Washington, teaming with Gordon Peterson, a well-liked local figure. Ratings soared and so did Mr. Robinson's popularity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He became a founding member of the National Association of Black Journalists. He mentored young reporters. \"He was a tremendous presence on the air,\" Ms. Matusow said. \"He was mobbed with admirers whenever he went out in Washington.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But even then stories of Mr. Robinson's erratic behavior abounded. In 1973, he walked out to the patio of his home, according to reports at the time, and shot a gun in the air. Mr. Robinson apologized, and the outburst was later attributed to grief over his father's death. His three marriages were unsuccessful. \"He was something of a ladies man,\" Mr. Page said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, Mr. Robinson drew the attention of ABC executives who wanted to overhaul \"World News Tonight.\" In 1978, he was hired from WTOP to become one of a new trinity of co-anchors that included the veteran newsman Frank Reynolds, based in Washington, and Peter Jennings, then an international correspondent in London. Mr. Robinson, for his part, would be based in Chicago and handle national stories.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"This was a big deal,\" Ms. Matusow said. \"Being an anchor was much bigger than it is today.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Chicago television critics gave the newcomer little leeway. \"They were just as vicious as they could possibly be,\" Roone Arledge, the television executive who hired him, told Vanity Fair in a 1989 profile of Mr. Robinson.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the star anchor periodically invited scrutiny. According to Vanity Fair, Mr. Robinson wore a fur coat to cover a fire in Los Angeles, forcing a producer to scramble to find him a more suitable jacket. His colleagues, too, could be dismissive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Peter Jennings, who later became the sole anchor of \"World News Tonight,\" said of Mr. Robinson in Vanity Fair, \"If he loved reporting more, I think his anchoring job would have had more strength.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Robinson saw it differently, Ms. Masutow recalled. \"Max, himself, felt a victim of racism,\" she said. \"He had his ideas and they didn't take to them. Instead it was, 'Here, read your copy.' \" She added, \"I think it was a shock to go to a network that looked down on you. \"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Robinson had begun to drink heavily. When Mr. Reynolds, his co-anchor, died in 1983, Mr. Robinson missed the funeral. \"He would attribute 'no shows' to blackout drunkenness,\" Mr. Page said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Robinson was sidelined at ABC when Mr. Jennings was named sole anchor of \"World News Tonight\" in 1983. He left ABC and got a job as an anchor at a local television station in Chicago. He retired in 1985.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An ABC spokesman said executives were not available to comment about Mr. Robinson or his career at the network. But in the Vanity Fair article, Mr. Arledge, who died in 2002, conceded that ABC made missteps. \"We should have realized that we'd taken a fragile flower and put it into a very difficult environment and we had to do more to nurture it,\" he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By the mid-1980s, Mr. Robinson received a diagnosis of AIDS. Mr. Page said Mr. Robinson denied being gay and attributed the disease to an active sex life. \"We would go to his apartment in Marina City and just talk,\" said Mr. Page, referring to Mr. Robinson's apartment on the banks of the Chicago River. Mr. Robinson, too, was cognizant of his impact on future generations of African-American broadcasters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"If he didn't do his job right,\" Mr. Page said, \"he knew they weren't going to have another one for a long time.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Max Robinson, Left, in 1978 with His Abc News Team: Roone Arledge, Who Hired Him, and His Co-Anchor Colleagues, Frank Reynolds, Center, and Peter Jennings, Right.

{"id": "txt/398616753.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>A Flawed Defense of Preferences</h2<p>It's a national coo-in. Editorial writers and columnists across the country are praising William G. Bowen and Derek Bok's new book, \"The Shape of the River,\" for having settled the debate over preferential admissions in higher education. Three major newspapers ran excerpts. Numerous others, including the New York Times, have declared the book the last word. The proof is in: Racial preferences at the college level work.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dream away. Messrs. Bowen and Bok have settled nothing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The book's subtitle announces the subject: \"Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions.\" The authors are the former presidents of Princeton and Harvard respectively, and had access to admissions records from 28 elite colleges (including Princeton but not Harvard). They were able to track the undergraduate and subsequent lives of 45,000 black and white students who were freshman in 1976 and 1989.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Messrs. Bowen and Bok do add to our store of facts. Their reading of the numbers, however, is seriously flawed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For instance, Messrs. Bowen and Bok assert that black students, once admitted, have done well. But the average black student who entered one of the 28 schools in 1989 had a grade point average upon graduation placing him in the 23rd percentile -- the bottom quarter of the class. The authors fail to tell us how many of those students needed a racial preference to get in, but it stands to reason that if they removed from the pool those who would have been admitted under a race-neutral standard, the average for the affirmative action admitees would look even worse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But note the graduation rates, they say -- an impressive 75% for black students. The white rate, however, is 86%, so there is a glaring racial disparity. Invert the numbers, and we see that the black dropout rate is 25% -- more than 78% higher than the white rate of 14%. At the very top schools, the black dropout rate is triple the white rate (15% vs. 5%). The racial disparity is worse in these selective institutions than in the college population as a whole.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Are colleges that are almost all white the alternative to racial double-standards, as the authors suggest? Without preferences, they argue, black enrollment would decline \"most of the way back to early 1960s levels.\" Their rhetoric is alarmist and their data deceptive. They divide their 28 schools into three groups, according to their degree of selectivity. In the top category, it is true, with race-neutral admissions the number of black students would drop 73%. But most of the rejected would likely land in the second-tier schools, an obvious probability that Messrs. Bowen and Bok brush aside. And many of those now in schools ranked second would also step down just one selectivity notch.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Do Messrs. Bowen and Bok believe these highly qualified students would disappear off the elite college map -- and head perhaps to the nearest community college? If one assumes that many would still attend one of their 28 elite schools, the picture looks very different from the one they have drawn. Without racial preferences, they say, half the black students in their pool would have been forced to attend less prestigious institutions. The correct number appears to be just 14%. And at any rate many of the rejected would go to select schools not on their list of 28.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Messrs. Bowen and Bok argue further that affirmative action in the highly selective institutions created the black middle class. It's an ahistorical point; blacks made impressive and rapid gains in the decades before preferences. Moreover, where did they get the notion that in our wonderfully open and fluid society, degrees from certain colleges are make-or-break?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The chief editorial writer at the Atlanta Constitution, Cynthia Tucker, and columnist Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune have both embraced the Bowen-Bok argument. Neither attended an elite institution. Ms. Tucker went to Auburn University, Mr. Page to Ohio University.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Other distinguished black journalists are also from allegedly dead-end colleges. Bob Herbert and Brent Staples, both of the New York Times, went to Empire State College and Widener University, respectively. Look, too, at the black power elite. Superlawyer Vernon Jordan went to DePauw, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman to Xavier, Sen. Carol Mosely-Braun (D., Ill.) to the University of Illinois. Army Secretary Togo West went to Howard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Believe Messrs. Bowen and Bok, and you might think it's Yale or jail. Well, not quite. But those not blessed with admission to a top school, they claim, are consigned to \"routine jobs.\" Do they mean sweeping floors? Perhaps they have in mind settling for a middle-class income in a small-business setting. In fact, as they surely know, the economically and professionally successful of all races started out in a wide variety of schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even on the narrow question of the importance of an elite education for those eager to pursue a doctorate or to study law or medicine, their data are questionable. True, a high number of black graduates from their 28 schools were admitted to graduate or professional school -- but this hardly is conclusive proof of their undergraduate success. After all, graduate and professional schools also have preferential admissions, a factor Messrs. Bowen and Bok ignore. With the average black student at the elite schools graduating in the 23rd percentile, further preferences become inevitable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Inadequately prepared students aren't likely to do well in highly competitive postgraduate settings, however. As my husband, Stephan Thernstrom, discovered by recalculating data from a well-known study, among black students who entered law school in 1991, 43% either failed to graduate or didn't pass the bar exam at the end of three years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moreover, when it comes to doctorates, it is the historically black colleges that have the impressive record, a point Messrs. Bowen and Bok fail to make. Of the 10 undergraduate institutions that produced the greatest number of blacks with doctorates in the years 1992-96, nine were black colleges. The 10th was Wayne State, not exactly an elite institution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Messrs. Bowen and Bok make much of the fact that a high portion of the students in their study made friends across racial lines. But they never compare their college data with the experience of ordinary whites and blacks, who also report high levels of interracial friendship. In 1997, for instance, 86% of whites in one national survey said they had black friends.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In fact, Messrs. Bowen and Bok explore a ridiculously closed universe. Where are their control groups, demonstrating in some rigorous fashion that the equally academically strong, ambitious and disciplined black student who attends the University of South Carolina instead of Oberlin does less well in life?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The authors correctly note that \"language itself has been a casualty of heated debate.\" And yet they themselves define crucial terms in misleading, politically correct ways. For instance, they call the admissions policies they endorse \"race sensitive.\" But when black college applicants are held to quite different standards than whites or Asians, their admission would seem more accurately described as \"race driven.\" They call the preferentially admitted black students highly qualified; well, yes, by irrelevant national standards, but not by those of the schools that have accepted them. \"Merit,\" they argue, is not simply a matter of pen-and-paper skills. So why don't they go all the way and argue for throwing out grades and test scores for applicants of whatever race?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The debate over higher education admissions has been long on emotions, biases and assumptions, the authors write. Alas, it's still true. Indeed, the rapidity with which media embraced \"The Shape of the River\" suggests one's views on the subject are still a matter of faith, not facts. And the effort to defend preferences in higher education only diverts attention away from the real problem: the inadequate job public schools are doing in preparing blacks for college.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Thernstrom is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and co-author of \"America in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible\" (Simon & Schuster, 1997).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Colorblind Admissions Hurts Black Students\" -- WSJ Oct. 8, 1998)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Race and Admissions Policies\" -- WSJ Oct. 16, 1998)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Elite Schools and Black Admissions\" -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1998)</p>\n"}

This complicated question is roiling the University of Michigan \u2014 and as is often the case in campus speech debates, the answers from all quarters are too simple.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Composer and educator Bright Sheng began his fall composition seminar by playing the 1965 film of Shakespeare's \"Othello\" starring Laurence Olivier in thickly applied dark face paint. What followed was unsurprising to those familiar with the racist history of minstrel entertainment, as well as the present-day tendency toward so-called wokeness in higher education: Upset students complained, including to the composition department. Eventually, though Mr. Sheng had delivered two apologies, the university announced that the professor would no longer teach the class to ensure a \"positive learning environment.\" A fellow faculty member described the screening as \"a racist act, regardless of the professor's intentions.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The incident has inspired a fervor among two opposing camps that fits neatly into a national argument. One group believes this is an example of a discourse-destroying cancel culture that poses an existential threat to American academia; the other believes it is an example instead of the marginalized finally empowered to challenge an oppressive institution with a habit of ignoring minority perspectives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Universities need to support their faculty's right to make occasional mistakes without career consequences and to hold views that might not be popular; that is the essence of academic freedom. Too often, academic bureaucrats are falling short. The Michigan case is far from the only example: This fall, under pressure, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology disinvited from delivering a prestigious public lecture a geophysicist who had expressed skepticism of affirmative action. MIT's decision reflected a distressing unwillingness to tolerate views that offend the liberal majority, especially baffling given that the subject of the lecture was climate change and possible life on other planets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Sheng's decision to kick off a course with, free of context or explanation, a trope that justifiably causes some people to feel distress was mistaken. Certainly it wasn't conducive to the aforementioned positive learning environment. Yet the decision to respond to this mistake only with punishment-seeking recrimination was wrong, too. Mr. Sheng reportedly hoped to show how Giuseppe Verdi turned the classic literary text of the play \"Othello\" into the opera \"Otello.\" Would an explanation of this aim and an acknowledgment of the deplorable custom of the era have helped? Was there any intellectual reason it was necessary, or even especially instructive, to show this production instead of one that didn't feature blackface?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These are matters that deserve discussion. Now, however, they won't get any. Sometimes an instructor or other authority figure's actions are so egregious, there's nothing to debate, but the default should be to invite dialogue rather than foreclose it. The status quo is shifting so that people whom society often ignored are heard. That's welcome. Yet the shift is a lost opportunity if the result is only to silence others instead.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The students can't teach the teachers if the teachers aren't given a chance to be taught.</p>\n"}

It was admitting that it constructed pre- Iraq war stories from--gasp--Bush administration sources. Without verifying the accuracy of \"dire claims\" about weapons of mass destruction, etc. Give us a break.

The Times must have been getting scorched by Bush-haters to admit that it had been taken in by the \"official gullibility and hype,\" whatever that means.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Confession is good for the soul, but the most striking thing about the editors' note was reference to a story in which it had buried its misgivings about the earlier reporting. The story was printed \"under a headline that gave no inkling that we were revising our earlier view.\" (Emphasis added.) This is the most startling of all admissions, that the paper's news coverage was and is guided by \"views.\" And what, may I ask, is the \"view\" that now regulates what gets into its news pages?

But in a review of hundreds of studies and reports, they found no link between mold and the awful brain damage, reproductive problems, cancer and other supposedly awful conditions that resulted in uncounted lawsuits and billions of dollars in insurance payments.

For example, a Sept. 12, 1999 \"Home Clinic\" story called mold \"a serious health hazard,\" without attribution, as if it were a given.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For stupid people</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Speaking of dire claims, lawsuits and other silliness, a 53-year- old Florida man is suing the company that promotes the Atkins diet, saying its high-fat diet plan clogged his arteries, threatened his health and gave him a brush with death. He's being assisted by an \"advocacy\" group, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which promotes a \"vegan\" diet of no meat, fish, dairy or egg products. The suit questions why the Atkins diet came without a warning label.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So here's what we're going to end up doing: \"Activists,\" abetted by lawyers, will push Congress to pass a law requiring a warning label for those people who are too stupid to figure it out. Then, as with mold turning out not to be as bad as warned, we'll next need warning labels for warning labels, warning us that the warning may be rot.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>E-mail: dbyrne1942@earthlink.net</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: area writer and public affairs consultant</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/421574199.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Multiculturalists Are People, Too; Politics: Somehow, building ethnic and racial coalitions has gotten a bad name.</h2<p>Over the past several months, there has been much bantering in the press and talk in the African American community about the issue of identity politics vs. multiculturalism. This is not a new discussion, but the recent electoral contests for the 10th District of the Los Angeles City Council and the 1st District of the Los Angeles school board intensified the debate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Essentially, what is being said is that if one works to build ethnic coalitions, and hence could be called a multiculturalist, then one is naive at best or a sellout at worst. And that, in either case, one is undermining one's group's seat at the table of American political power. Further, some say that multiculturalism ignores this country's white supremacist history and downplays contemporary economic inequities that are a result of continuing institutionalized racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Conversely, if one supports identity politics, then one is savvy and looking out for the interests of the black community.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet for black interests to advance in the Los Angeles of the 21st century, an extreme position taken in either camp cannot be the foundation for a workable Realpolitik. Coalition building is not leaving one's culture or ethnicity at the door; each group within the coalition will have issues pertinent to its particular group. Nor can identity politics be used to overlook the outrageous antics or status quo performance of elected officials or community leaders simply because they share the same skin color or ethnic origin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The African American community is entitled to and obligated to organize itself and identify the specific issues that are of concern to it as a whole, e.g., our over-representation in jails and prisons, police accountability, racial profiling or the devastation of AIDs. But an authentic, historically grounded multiculturalism should have us gain strength by forming coalitions with allies of other racial and ethnic groups who share our political and economic issues. Such coalitions will demand accountability and maturity from both those we elect and our community leaders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Multicultural politics is about holding other partners in the effort accountable, too. For instance, in recent years there have been multiracial efforts to defend affirmative action (defeat Proposition 209), defend immigrant rights (defeat Proposition 187) and stop the passage of the three-strikes law (Proposition 184). These coalitions involved a great deal of internal dialogue as to strategies and tactics. There were also closed-door talks among some Latino activists that three-strikes was a black concern and not something they were going to organize in the Latino community about. Conversely, there were some black activists who had the same perspective in terms of defending immigrant rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Coalition politics requires partners in an endeavor to agree to disagree at times. But it also means that a common agenda can be forged around critical issues, including public education, the criminal justice system, affordable housing, mass transit, health care and jobs--issues that affect many people but disproportionately impact African Americans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The black community can look for ways to strengthen its effectiveness from within and work in coalition with others; these are not mutually exclusive goals. We must scrutinize the platforms and programs of any leader or group and not simply accept the usual from leaders because they happen to look like us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Isabelle R.

He's also suspicious of women's studies, gay and lesbian studies, \"Black Welcome Week,\" Latino orientation day, separate graduation ceremonies, ethnic \"theme houses\" in some of the dorms and everything else he sees as \"Balkanizing\" life on the campuses of California's state universities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He admitted to me in a telephone interview that he doesn't know much about gay, ethnic or women's studies, to name just three issues. He also insisted for the record that he does not, \"repeat, not,\" plan to crusade against them as a University of California regent the way he led the successful Proposition 209 campaign.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But he does plan to visit classes and talk to faculty over the next couple of months to conduct his own \"private\" investigation. He may come away convinced, he says, although he admits \"I do have my biases.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Connerly, who is African-American, raised eyebrows when he told an Associated Press reporter last week that he suspects Hispanic, African-American, Asian-American, Native American and other ethnic studies programs are promoting \"self-imposed segregation\" at the state's colleges. If so, he said, he wants to put a stop to it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was the rise of a recent student movement to form a gay and lesbian studies department at the University of California at Davis campus that was the last straw, Connerly told me. He questioned whether the purpose of the classes was truly academic or whether they were exercises in racial, ethnic and gender cheerleading.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He questioned whether ethnic studies was \"something people can learn from their parents, at home, without the taxpayers paying for it.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I pointed out that many students have enrolled in studies about groups to which they do not personally belong--white and Latino students in black studies, for example, and men in women's studies--he said he was impressed, but added, \"that has not been my experience\" during campus visits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Too bad. But Connerly's idea intrigues me. What if he's right? If we get rid of those divisive ethnic studies, which hardly existed before the late 1960s, can we can get back to the togetherness we had before?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ah, yes, whatever happened to those halcyon days of old, those days of unity, those days before those Balkanizing ethnic studies came along?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whatever happened to those jolly days of housing covenants, legal job discrimination, segregated lunch counters and other aspects of American togetherness?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How united we were when the only people who really counted in history and literature classes were white and, for that matter, male. How light-hearted our students could be, unburdened by any obligation to learn about anybody else.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But, why, I wondered, stop with studies about women, gays and ethnics?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As long as we're going after academic special interests, how about European studies?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After all, if studies of the history and culture of one particular group are Balkanizing, why exempt the part of the world that gave \"Balkanize\" its name?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Do we really need all those classes in Socrates, Milton, Shakespeare, Mozart and Chopin? Are they going to get you a job in today's global economy?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Or are they merely exercises in ethnic cheerleading? Are they \"something people can learn from their parents, at home, without the taxpayers paying for it.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hey, didn't your mom always keep a copy of Plato's \"The Republic\" within easy reach, right next to Dr. Spock and Betty Crocker?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You want unity? Take my word for it: Announce to America's college students that they no longer will have to learn European history and you're going to see a lot of students from every race, creed and color dancing in the streets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Closer to home, how about Civil War studies?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Talk about Balkanizing. The farther you go south of, say, Ohio, the more you run into people who don't question who won the Civil War or, as they may prefer to call it, the \"War Between the States\" or, my personal favorite, \"The War of Northern Aggression.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And what about all those foreign language studies classes? What can be more divisive and self-segregating than to have a bunch of people on campus practicing how to talk to each other in languages only a few other students can understand?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I'm not saying this is what we should do. I'm only raising questions, just like Connerly is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let's not think small. Why not pull everyone together by eliminating courses that don't teach everybody the same basic stuff?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's a good way to make everybody the same, together and equal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Equally ignorant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by John MacDonald.</p>\n"}

{"id": "txt/398209305.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Echoes of the '50s in Rooney Witch Hunt</h2<p>CBS and its president, David Burke, may think otherwise, but Andy Rooney's suspension is going to be with us -- and them -- for a long time to come. True, it is only one of countless similar punishments that nowadays regularly befall people who publicly express something other than the politically \"correct\" view of homosexuality, women's rights, race and the like. Still, there is something in the nature of this suspension, something special in the dimensions of cravenness it represents, that puts it among the more memorable examples of repression in our time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Rooney's particular difficulties began in a year-end special aired on Dec. 28, in which he said that \"many of the ills which kill us are self-induced: too much alcohol, too much food, drugs, homosexual unions, cigarettes. They're all known to lead quite often to premature deaths.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) began a letter-writing campaign against Mr. Rooney, and asked CBS to suspend or, preferably, fire him. Mr. Rooney then sent a letter of apology to The Advocate, a biweekly magazine for homosexuals, in which he explained his views. The same issue of the magazine carried an interview with an Advocate reporter, in which Mr. Rooney is supposed to have said that blacks had watered down their genes because the least intelligent ones have the most children -- a comment Mr. Rooney emphatically denies making. The Advocate reporter who conducted the interview could provide no tape record of this interview, whose incendiary quote about blacks was, Mr. Rooney charges, entirely fabricated as part of the campaign mounted against him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But Mr. Rooney's denial that he had made the comment about blacks attributed to him made little difference, in light of the comments he clearly did make in his letter of apology to homosexuals. That letter doomed him, CBS sources acknowledge. In it Mr. Rooney had said flatly what it is of course not now permissible to say -- namely that the particular physical practices male homosexuals engage in were repugnant to him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Is it ethically or morally wrong or abnormal behavior?\" Mr. Rooney added. \"It seems so to me. . . .\" In these altogether personal and reflective comments, Mr. Rooney also noted that he thought of gay men as victims, and of AIDS as a largely preventable disease.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That homosexuals should take exception to these views is not surprising. That CBS's president should so instantaneously have yielded to the pressure to punish Mr. Rooney for comments like these is, however, startling even for these times -- particularly given the extreme nature of this punishment. It was not simply a three-month suspension that CBS meted out to Mr. Rooney for his failure to obey the precepts of correct thinking on the subject of homosexuality: CBS's management in addition made it clear that, as between the word of the Advocate reporter and that of Mr. Rooney, who has been associated with CBS since the late '40s, they chose to believe the former, notwithstanding the lack of a shred of evidence besides the reporter's accusation of racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Certain offenses, those of racism and homophobia in particular, now have such status that it is necessary only to be accused of them to be found guilty or at least irremediably tainted. It needs no more than such an accusation to bring the capitulation of a large and powerful broadcast network.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are familiar echoes in all of this, for anyone old enough to recall the 1950s -- the era when the crime of crimes was communism. Then it was enough merely to have a name published in Red Channels, for political vigilantes merely to phone networks -- as well as other institutions -- to charge that a performer held communist views, to assure that the performer would be out of work in short order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All this of course is old news -- the sort of thing our activists of today like to look back on when preening themselves on their superiority to the so-called conformist generation of the '50s. Back in the Dark Age of the 1950s, according to this view, McCarthyites ruled the land, and none but a pitiful few raised their voices in dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What is wrong with all this is that this is a description truer of our current age of repression than it was of the 1950s. Things are in fact worse today, in significant ways. In the 1950s, for example, the universities, and the intellectuals and academics generally, were focal points of resistance to McCarthy, Red Channels, thought control and efforts to abridge free speech. Today, the universities and the academics are the main perpetrators of thought control and repression -- places where even small deviations from the established orthodoxies on women, homosexuality or race bring instant retribution and threats to job security. It was the UCLA of the late 1980s -- not the 1950s -- that suspended an editor of the student paper for running a cartoon that derided affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And it is the CBS of the 1990s that seems not unlike the CBS of the 1950s -- of 1957, in fact, when it fired popular radio-show host John Henry Faulk, when pressured to do so by a group called AWARE Inc., which had determined on the basis of his union activities that Mr. Faulk was not a loyal American.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The day after Mr. Rooney's suspension was announced, CBS logged 2,549 calls in New York alone, just four of which favored the network's action. Mr. Rooney himself received an avalanche of calls, among them a number of death threats.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So far we have seen no outpouring by artists and intellectuals like those who emerged -- however timorously -- to proclaim Salman Rushdie's right to free expression, though Mr. Rushdie's \"Satanic Verses\" had given the most grievous offense to Moslems, no outpouring by notables like those who rushed to defend the right to exhibit, as art, a crucifix dipped in urine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On college campuses, objections to visits by Minister Louis Farrakhan, a renowned anti-Semite, are not only considered abridgements of the right of free speech that all good citizens should abhor -- those objections are shouted down as \"racist.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All of which is to say that what happened to Andy Rooney simply emphasizes a fact that has long been obvious -- namely that nowadays, the right to untrammeled free expression is limited to certain select groups, namely minority and similar activists. Afro-American studies lecturers frequently preach venomously racist views directed at white America, and do so with impunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the dark days of the '50s witch hunts, people used to ask: But how was it possible that a grocer from Syracuse could publish a guide called Red Channels and get the broadcast networks to cave? How could large and powerful institutions everywhere fall prey to such fear and the need to appease the zealots and pressure groups?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this, our very own McCarthyite era, an era in which the only truly permissible public discussion of race or homosexuality or similarly protected subjects is the expression of pieties, it is no longer necessary to ask such questions. It is necessary only to look around -- to look, for example, at the spectacle of CBS last week -- to see history re-enacted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Rabinowitz, a writer in New York, comments frequently on the media.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/410216833.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Who's Raising Race?; The Messages Loaded Into a McCain Surrogate's Words</h2<p>I'm confident that Sen. Lindsey Graham and the rest of John McCain's front-line surrogates know full well what messages they're sending about Barack Obama and race. On the off chance that they  --  or, more likely, some of the white voters they're trying to reach  --  don't know text from subtext from context, here's a deconstruction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On Sunday, the exceedingly thin-skinned Graham was still shocked, saddened and outraged over Obama's throwaway line, spoken days earlier, about not looking like previous presidents. Graham said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that \"there's no doubt in my mind that what Senator Obama is trying to suggest  --  that he's a victim of something.\" Graham later added: \"We're not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary. Every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe, 'You're a racist.' That's not going to happen in this campaign.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The key words are \"victim\" and \"racist\"  --  which Obama did not say. Graham puts them in Obama's mouth because of their power to alienate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With the first loaded word, Graham is trying to tie Obama to a stereotype: the Great African American Victim. He's playing to the annoyance some whites feel at being reminded of racial sins committed long before they were born or even long before their families came to this country.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As Graham well knows, Obama has taken great pains to sanitize his campaign of even the faintest whiff of victimhood.  Obama understands that in order to be elected president, he has to come off as the least-aggrieved black man in America.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most of his supporters understand this, too. They know that he can't react with anger when his love of country is questioned over a flag pin. They see that he can't be seen to take offense when his self-confidence  --  a quality shared by every U.S. senator I've ever met  --  is portrayed as arrogance, as if he had somehow reached beyond his station by thinking he is worthy  of being elected president.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the kerfuffle of the past week indicates, it's apparently even problematic for Obama to attempt to describe the Republican Party's obvious game plan of defining him as different, exotic and risky.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Obama could note, however, that the tactic doesn't seem to be working. A new poll by The Post, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University shows him leading McCain by 10 points, 47 to 37 percent, among white low-income workers. These people have to be made to fear or distrust Obama, and in a hurry, or McCain loses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The second of the bombshell words that Obama didn't say  --  but that Graham would like you to think that he said  --  is an even bigger canard. He called me a racist has become a popular and convenient refuge of scoundrels. It's the place, for example, where Geraldine Ferraro went to hide when she was challenged on her claim that Obama wouldn't be where he was if he weren't black. In fact, as far as I'm aware, nobody called Ferraro a racist; to do so would imply knowledge of her most private thoughts, as well as a reassessment of her long career in public life. Rather, what I and many others said was that her remarks were insulting and wrong  --  with the focus on what she had said, not on what was in her soul.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's an obvious difference, which Lindsey Graham surely understands. But on Sunday, when former senator  --  and current Obama supporter  --  Tom Daschle accurately reminded Graham that Obama \"has never said that he believes that John McCain is a racist,\" Graham wouldn't acknowledge the point. As long as he doesn't, it's possible to create the false impression that Obama accuses his critics of being racists.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This battle over Obama's image as a black man is arguably the central front of the presidential campaign right now. Once-sharp lines between the candidates on issues such as withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq or allowing new offshore oil drilling are becoming blurred. The Democratic Party's structural advantages going into the election are formidable. It's hard to imagine how McCain could possibly win unless he generates doubt in voters' minds about Obama.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One way to do that would be to fabricate the impression that Obama is demanding special treatment and privilege because he is black  --  in other words, turn a self-made man into a stereotypical beneficiary of affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The writer will answer questions at 1 p.m. today at www.washingtonpost.com.

Elizabeth Warren won't drop the Pocahontas bit, why should President Trump? There are plenty of good reasons for both of them to move on, but first things first.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I've noticed that every time my name comes up, President Trump likes to talk about Pocahontas,\" said Ms. Warren in a speech last Wednesday to the National Congress of American Indians. \"So I figured, let's talk about Pocahontas.\" Why an audience full of Native Americans needed a lecture from Ms. Warren on \"the real Pocahontas\" is unclear, but the senator went on at some length on the subject.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Trump began calling Ms. Warren \"Pocahontas\" in 2016 to mock her questionable claim of American Indian heritage, but such skepticism has been dogging the liberal Democrat since her run for the U.S. Senate in 2012. Ms. Warren has never provided any official documentation to substantiate her supposed Cherokee and Delaware heritage, and she didn't provide any last week.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rather, she has based her claims over the years on childhood stories and the fact that an aunt once said the family \"had high cheekbones like all the Indians do.\" As a law professor in the 1980s and '90s, she self-identified as Native American in school directories in the hope that she might \"be invited to a luncheon\" where she could \"meet others like me.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whether Ms. Warren made these claims to improve her job prospects or merely to get invited to a luncheon is an open question. She contributed recipes to a 1984 cookbook titled \"Pow Wow Chow\" and signed her name \"Elizabeth Warren--Cherokee.\" The Association of American Law Schools listed Ms. Warren as a minority professor every year from 1986 to 1994, and a spokesman for Harvard Law School, where the future senator began teaching in 1995, once touted her Native American background as proof that the faculty was becoming more diverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Defenders of affirmative action tell minorities there's no shame in being hired for their race rather than their skills, and no embarrassment in being admitted to a school despite scoring below their fellow students on admissions tests. But nobody with any self-respect wants to be the diversity hire or the token minority on campus. Nobody wants his achievements tainted or diminished, and quotas and set-asides allow others to take credit for the individual accomplishments of racial and ethnic minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Warren may be one of the Senate's leading progressives, but even she bristled at accusations that she cited Indian heritage to take advantage of racial preferences and advance her academic career. \"I am who I am,'' she told the Boston Globe during her 2012 Senate campaign. \"I think you've talked to the people who hired me and I think they have said as clearly as humanly possible that I got what I got because of the work I've done.\" You go, girl.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Warren knows that the president's Pocahontas digs are intended to mock her fabulations rather than the heritage of American Indians, but that didn't stop her from conflating the two in her speech. She accused Mr. Trump of \"reducing native history, native culture, native people to the butt of a joke,\" and said, \"Every time someone brings up my family's story, I'm going to use it to lift up the story of your families and your communities.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's very touching, but from what we can gather Elizabeth Warren finds Native American heritage useful only insofar as it helps her advance the interests of Elizabeth Warren. Thirty years ago, she wrapped herself in a poncho, evidently to gain Ivy League teaching positions. Today, she's doing the same to ward off political attacks from the president.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Native Americans face real problems. Their rates of poverty, alcoholism, gang membership and sexual abuse are the highest of any racial group in the country. Their rate of child abuse is double the national average. The second leading cause of death for Native American males between 10 and 14 is suicide. And all these problems worsen significantly when you restrict the sample to Indians who live on reservations. American Indians need public-policy solutions, not more politicians using them as political shields.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Trump should find less offensive ways to spar with political opponents, but no one is holding his breath hoping that the president will mature. At the same time, let's not pretend that Ms. Warren is a stand-in for Native Americans. Credit for exposing the \"cultural appropriation\" of this self-styled progressive is owed in part to Mr. Trump, who has a knack for getting his detractors to make total fools of themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By Jason L.

{"id": "txt/418425770.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Army's race, gender policies on trial</h2<p>In a sign of how much things have changed on America's racial scene, a retired Lt. Col. Raymond Saunders charges that the Army denied him a promotion to full colonel in 1996 and 1997 because he is a white male.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's progress, folks. America's military was legally segregated until the late 1940s and aggressive equal-opportunity policies did not come along until the 1960s. Now, according to Saunders' lawyers, there are a number of disgruntled white officers who say the service has stacked the deck against them because their race and gender are politically incorrect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Well, whatever you think of their accusation, they deserve their day in court and it looks as though Saunders is going to get his. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled Monday that Saunders' case can proceed to trial. The judge agreed with the retired officer that the Army's written directions to promotion boards unconstitutionally give preference to one race or gender over another- -specifically non-whites and women over white men.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although the instructions urged promotion boards to consider past discrimination faced by female and non-white candidates, the judge ruled, it did not order the boards to also consider whether there had been discrimination against white men.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Oops! Was that an oversight or what? The language of the policy in question has since been changed, Army lawyers point out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Besides, the Army argues, Saunders, who retired in 1999 and then filed a lawsuit, probably would not have been promoted even if the equal-opportunity policy had not been in place. Whether that's true or not, the case moves on. As it does, it puts in peril a series of equal-opportunity policies that, until now, have provided a model for civilian corporations and others who want to open opportunities to women and non-whites without lowering standards or committing \"reverse discrimination\" against white men.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As with all the arguments over affirmative action, a little knowledge of history is helpful here. Today's equal-opportunity policy in the Army largely grew out of the time President Jimmy Carter's made Clifford Alexander the first black secretary of the Army.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As Alexander later described it to me, he was dissatisfied with the absence of women and non-whites on the first list of colonels he received who were candidates for promotion to general. He sent the list back and asked for it to be expanded, with an eye on including a more race and gender diverse pool of applicants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the colonels included on the new list happened to be Colin Powell, later the nation's first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and now the nation's first black secretary of state.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The story is significant because so many Americans think of Powell as an example of someone who never needed \"affirmative action.\" In fact, affirmative action does not have to mean lowered standards or double standards. It also means simply trying harder to reach out and expand the pool of available candidates for various positions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By whatever means, about a third of all first sergeants and sergeant majors in the Army were black by the end of the 1990s, along with 11 percent of the Army's officer corps and 9 percent of its generals. As Charles C. Moskos, a sociology professor and military personnel expert at Northwestern University, liked to say, the Army became \"the only place in the American workforce where whites are routinely bossed around by blacks.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the officer promotion boards are not \"color blind.\" Sometimes their instructions mention affirmative action goals, but not hard quotas. There are no timetables, in other words, for achieving the goals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The policy also warns that the guidelines \"shall not be interpreted as requiring or authorizing you to extend any preference of any sort to any officer or group of officers solely on the basis of race, ethnicity or gender.\" In other words, take questions of race and gender and prejudice into account, but don't make them your main criterion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, the boards do have to justify their shortfalls and they frequently fall short, particularly in promotions from captain to major, according to Moskos and John S. Butler of the University of Texas at Austin in their 1996 book \"All That We Can Be: Black Leadership and Racial Integration the Army Way.\" In all other ranks, including colonel through general officers, the authors found little racial difference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So does that constitute pressure on the boards to discriminate against white men? Or is it merely a strong incentive for them to give a fair shake to non-whites and women?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Either way, it is just murky enough to keep everyone on their toes about the importance of fairness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is no perfect way to weed out all forms of racism or sexism. But there are many ways to level a playing field that was tilted one way for far too long. By putting its emphasis on performance, not perfection, the Army has become a laboratory for the rest of us in the most agreeable affirmative action of all: Make an honest effort to be fair and you won't have to worry about finding enough qualified minorities and women. A world of talent will beat a path to your door.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>E-mail: cptime@aol.com</p>\n"}

The excerpts, reported this week by Kurt Eichenwald of The Times, come from a meeting held in August 1994 during which three senior executives discussed a class-action lawsuit filed by black employees who charged that Texaco had discriminated against them and created a racially hostile atmosphere. The Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission essentially validated the suit, ruling that there was reason to believe Texaco guilty of company-wide racial bias.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Transcripts of the August tapes leave little doubt about the atmosphere at the company. Senior executives, including Texaco's former treasurer Robert Ulrich, freely deride black employees as ''niggers'' and ''black jelly beans.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Ulrich is quoted in the transcripts as belittling the interest of black employees in Kwanzaa, an Africanist celebration held in December. ''I'm still having trouble with Hanukkah,'' Mr. Ulrich said. ''Now we have Kwanzaa.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The tapes were made by Richard A. Lundwall, a senior personnel official at Texaco responsible for keeping minutes of the meetings, who made the tapes available to the plaintiffs after he was laid off. At several points on the tapes, the Texaco executives openly discuss destroying records to protect themselves in the discrimination case. Federal prosecutors in White Plains are investigating to determine whether the records were actually destroyed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Peter I. Bijur, Texaco's chairman, has deplored the insensitivity of the taped remarks and placed the company's equal-opportunity programs under review. He issued a statement saying that discrimination is not the Texaco way.

But that punishment might be seen as retribution for his releasing the tapes rather than as a penalty for discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When its investigations are complete, Texaco will need to make an example of all those who uttered racist comments at the meeting and make it clear that discrimination will no longer be tolerated.

The bill set specific quotas, dates by which those quotas had to be met and penalties if they were not met.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was troubling from the start.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even Gov. Jerry Brown, when he signed it into law, made it clear he wasn\u2019t sure the new measure would survive court challenges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The law\u2019s goal \u2014 bringing women into the world of corporate leadership from which they have been for so long excluded \u2014 is entirely laudable. It\u2019s shameful that corporations haven\u2019t corrected the imbalance themselves. Only 28% of Fortune 500 corporate directors are women, according to a study in 2020 by the recruiting firm Spencer Stuart.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But Senate Bill 826 was just too intrusive. It crossed a line \u2014 my personal line, anyway \u2014 from progressive reform into government overreach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The law was, of course, challenged in court. But the lawsuit, brought on behalf of an indignant shareholder by the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation in 2019, seemed dead after a federal judge ruled that the plaintiff lacked standing to sue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Until late June, that is, when the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court\u2019s decision, revived the case and sent it back for trial. New briefs are due in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So the future of the law is once again uncertain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The law directed every publicly held company with its executive headquarters in California to appoint at least one woman to its board of directors by the end of 2019. By the end of 2021, all five-member boards must include at least two women, while boards with six or more directors need to have three. Companies that do not meet the requirements could face hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today, hundreds of companies are in compliance (although it\u2019s difficult to know for sure how much is the result of the law). California Secretary of State Shirley Weber says the law is \u201cimportant to ensuring an equitable economy and inclusive California.\u201d The California Partners Project says there are still 418 California companies that need to fill 563 board seats with women.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I\u2019m not a laissez-faire, free-market evangelist. I support increased minimum wages, higher corporate taxes and strict workplace protections. I also support affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But this was the wrong approach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is terribly presumptuous of state government to get so deeply and prescriptively involved in the private sector\u2019s business. Do we really want legislators telling shareholders of companies who should sit on their governing bodies?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One big justification for the law \u2014 asserted repeatedly in its preamble \u2014 was that companies will be more successful and more profitable if they have women on their boards. Some studies suggest that is true; others don\u2019t.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But how best to make money is a decision companies should make for themselves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Furthermore, it\u2019s not clear that such a drastic measure was necessary. The number of women on boards has been steadily rising on its own. In 2020, the Spencer Stuart report found, 95% of Fortune 500 boards nationwide included two or more female directors, an increase from 56% in 2010. In 2020, 47% of the new appointees to corporate boards were women.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Several months ago, Assemblyman Evan Low (D-Campbell), one of the law\u2019s supporters, told me: \u201cI don\u2019t believe we should leave it to capitalism to solve society\u2019s problems. We\u2019ll use the Constitution and the authority we have to create as inclusive a society as we can.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But not all problems are government\u2019s to solve. Besides, it\u2019s one thing to remove obstacles to advancement. It\u2019s quite another to set quotas and impose mandates, legislating not just equality of opportunity but equality of outcome.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many lawyers \u2014 and the pending lawsuit \u2014 argue that the law violates the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which forbids any state to \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d They say it mandates gender discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cSerious legal concerns have been raised,\u201d Gov. Brown acknowledged. \u201cI don\u2019t minimize the potential flaws that indeed may prove fatal to its ultimate implementation.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled in cases in which it has upheld affirmative action programs that specific race- or sex-based quotas are not permissible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last year, California followed up the women-on-boards law with a second law mandating that corporate boards must also have members of \u201cunderrepresented communities,\u201d a category including African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, gays, lesbians and other designated groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Clearly this is a slippery slope. Why would the state stop at board seats? Why not impose quotas on C-level executives as well? Or on employees generally? Is parity only desirable in the boardroom?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And if we\u2019re mandating diversity for corporations, why not for government too? Why not set aside 50% of the seats in California\u2019s city councils for women? What\u2019s to stop Texas from passing a law mandating a specific number of Christians on boards of directors?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You may laugh, but many countries do set quotas for women in their parliaments, which I also think is a not great idea. It\u2019s an effort to legislate equality \u2014 at the expense of democracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think this is the direction the country wants to be heading.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course there should be diversity \u2014 gender, racial and otherwise \u2014 on corporate boards, in the workforce, in politics and everywhere else. And I agree that waiting patiently for that to happen on its own is not the solution. People need to stand up and speak out for the change they believe in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But heavy-handed government mandates are not the way to do it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>@Nick_Goldberg</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/421387522.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>THE NATION; DISCRIMINATION; Stanford's Hiring Quandary</h2<p>The charge by 15 current and former women faculty members at Stanford that the university has engaged in widespread discrimination against women and minority groups in hiring and tenure decisions highlights a crucial ambiguity in affirmative-action policy. Two sets of criteria with quite different genealogies govern affirmative action. One draws on the tradition, embodied in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that equal protection under the law means equal rights for all without regard to race or gender. The other asserts that equal protection makes racial or gender identification permissible and necessary. In this view, preferential treatment based on race or gender is a rational means of remedying past discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This ambiguity leaves Stanford in a quandary: There is no clear agreement, either on or off campus, as to what constitutes the discrimination alleged by the women faculty in a complaint to the U.S. Labor Department, which is investigating. This is no semantic quibble. College and university officials across the country have repeatedly been told thataffirmative action's prohibition against discrimination means that men and women should receive \"equal treatment.\" But what kind of treatment is \"equal\" remains a matter of dispute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What's not in dispute is that the meaning of discrimination has changed. At one time, it depended on whether race or gender were \"intentional\" factors in hiring. Now discrimination can be said to occur even if a university's faculty and administration have not \"intentionally\" discriminated. The test Stanford must meet is whether its hiring and promotion practices have disproportionately disadvantaged women and minorities after the fact.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This shift in definition \"does not make it easy to know precisely what the law dictates in the uncertain and evolving area of affirmative action,\" says Stanford President Gerhard Casper. For example, a college or university used to undertake affirmative action to ensure equal treatment without regard to race or sex. Now equal treatment of individuals is seen as possibly impeding progress toward what some insist is a more important affirmative-action goal: the immediate and preferential hiring of women and minorities in the quest for statistical parity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Detaching \"without regard to\" from the concept of discrimination, in combination with the Labor Department's investigation of the charge that certain groups are underrepresented on Stanford's faculty, raises a troubling question for Casper: Is Stanford's existing policy of rejecting separate standards for different groups in deciding who should be granted tenure or promotion legal?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Provost Condoleezza Rice has drawn fire for her reservations about applying \"goals and timetables\" to tenure and promotion decisions. But her concern is easily misunderstood. If the basic goal of affirmative action is to assure that members of both sexes and of all races and ethnic groups are accorded equal employment opportunities, a numerical analysis of the circumstances of different groups can be helpful. It can be especially useful if its purpose is not simply to generate statistics but, instead, to assist the university in reaching out to women and minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A preoccupation with numbers and statistical parity suggests that the primary objective of a university in faculty hiring should be to use goal setting as a way of favoring applicants on the basis of race or gender. But as Princeton's former president, William Bowen, stated more than 20 years ago, \"The aggregate numbers for groups of people should be seen as expected byproducts of affirmative-action efforts, not as goals themselves.\" In his view, it is important to overcome any notion that a woman or minority has been hired only because a numerical goal had to be reached. In short, the numbers game cannot make equality of opportunity an immediate reality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Federal officials have persistently maintained that numerical goals are not quotas, but simply a way of evaluating whether a university is meeting its affirmative-action obligations within a specified time period. When is a quota not a quota? When it is a numerical goal? Is there really a significant difference between a university setting a quota of 10% bearded Republicans on the faculty within five years and announcing as its numerical goal the hiring of 10% bearded Republicans within five years? Perhaps the difference is a matter of perception. For federal investigators who wish to impose them, they are called \"goals.\" But for an academic department that must apply them in making faculty appointments, they may become the functional equivalent of quotas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are other difficulties with the idea that goals and timetables must be applied when lifetime faculty tenure is under consideration. University officials regularly have been told that goals are to be specific numbers, to be measurable and to have timetables. When pressed, however, federal officials frequently say the goals do not have to be \"rigid and inflexible\" but simply targets that are \"reasonably attainable.\" Stanford, now charged with backing away from its pledge to comply with affirmative-action requirements, cannot help but wonder what measurable and specific, yet flexible goals, applied flexibly and attached to a timetable, will look like. Furthermore, what is \"reasonable\"? What are the criteria by which the Labor Department will make its decision?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Few people at Stanford would disagree that it should concentrate its efforts on its essential mission: education. The question is whether asking the university to compromise its efforts to affirm the principle of nondiscrimination and equal opportunity, by establishing as its major goal an immediate increase in the number of women and minority faculty, constitutes a fundamental error. There should be no misunderstanding on this point. Stanford must continue to seek a more cosmopolitan faculty. But instead of that being the primary, if not exclusive goal, it should be viewed as a desirable result of an equality-minded policy for which there is wide faculty approval.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As part of its investigation, the Labor Department should state clearly that Stanford serves society best by providing quality education on the basis of equal access and equal treatment. Not only is that the university's primary function, it is also Stanford's primary way to reduce inequality in the country. If the educational mission were regarded as paramount, many of the ambiguities and contradictions of affirmative action would be avoided.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: GRAPHIC-DRAWING: GAYLE HEGLAND / for The Times</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: John H.

By Bruce Headlam</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Can anybody get into Harvard? If you're one of the thousands of students who have just completed the grueling college admissions process and are awaiting the results from selective universities, the answer is no, of course. But if you have been to the movies in the past few months, you might think anyone could. In \"Legally Blonde,\" Reese Witherspoon plays a ditzy sorority girl who lands at Harvard Law School thanks to a video resume with generous footage of her in a bikini; in \"How High,\" Method Man and Redman play two small-time pot dealers who light up Cambridge; and in \"Orange County,\" a West Coast variation on the theme, a Stanford reject shows up on campus to plead his case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In their own ways, the films provoke a much more interesting question: can anybody succeed at Harvard? In other words, what if what it takes to get into an elite college and what it takes to prosper there are two entirely separate things? The only way to truly test the admissions process would be to accept enough homecoming queens and homeboys to make a meaningful comparison. And not many schools are willing to take that risk.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But it has happened. In 1979, the University of Texas Medical School selected 150 first-year students from a pool of 800 interviewees. The State Legislature then mandated that the class size be increased by 50 students, who had to be pulled from the bottom of the original pool. The initially rejected students came in with inferior marks, poorer test scores and lower personal evaluations. Yet at every measurable step during their medical education, from term marks to residency, their performance as a group was indistinguishable not just from the rest of their peers but also from the top 50 students in the class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What the Texas case illustrates is the distinction between what social psychologists call selection effects and treatment effects. It wasn't the students' qualifications (the selection effect) that determined performance; it was the four years spent in the classroom (the treatment effect) that was transcendent. In other words, the students did well because they were in a good school, not because they were inherently good students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Freed from the lab, the terms selection and treatment provide a handy division for categorizing all kinds of institutions, those that hire the employees with the best credentials (selection) and those that would rather train their own (treatment). In business, new-economy Enron was a selection company: you either got it or you didn't, as its former C.E.O. Jeffrey Skilling liked to say. G.E., which did as much for Jack Welch as Jack Welch did for G.E. (even if his autobiography doesn't always read that way), is a classic treatment company. In sports,the New York Yankees are the all-selection team, skimming off the best from the rest of the league. The Oakland Athletics are a treatment franchise, developing their own talent, which they invariably lose to the Yankees. In pop music, the Beatles were a selection band: you couldn't just replace Paul McCartney. The Temptations? Pure treatment: they sounded the same no matter who was singing, a lesson not lost on every boy band since.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition to making for a great little sociological parlor game, the selection-treatment scheme is a useful one for examining another instance of underqualified students at elite institutions: affirmative action, which once again finds itself under a microscope in the courts. Since the Bakke decision in 1978, the debate has revolved largely around the means of preferential admissions - the displacement of deserving white candidates by minority applicants - and less around their outcomes. But the biggest study of race-- conscious admissions at selective colleges, \"The Shape of the River\" (1998), found that students admitted with the benefit of affirmative action performed only slightly below class average and, after graduation, outgained many of their peers. As was the case in Texas, what happened to students after frosh week mattered more than how they were ranked by the admissions office.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Why, then, does affirmative action remain an embarrassing phrase even among some of its supporters? Perhaps part of the problem is that an individualistic society, after all, is predicated on the belief in personal characteristics. We like to believe that Great Men (and Women) shape events and not the other way around. Even the thriving self-help movement emphasizes the recovery of our \"authentic selves.\" Part of this belief is vanity: we all like to think we're irreplaceable. It's difficult to accept that many people could perform equally well if given a seat in the front row. But the evidence is that they can, and not just in the classroom. Over the past few months, some of George Bush's harshest critics have reluctantly conceded that given the right circumstances, even a chief executive with shaky credentials can grow on the job. Is it so hard to believe the same thing about a 17-year-old? Or do we cheer underdogs only when they look like Reese Witherspoon?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bruce Headlam is an editor for the Circuits section of The New York Times.</p>\n"}

Martin Luther King Jr. holiday under new laws in multiple states that ban the instruction of \"divisive\" interpretations of our racial past. The assaults have given new weapons to an enduring faction in American society that has long resisted the reckoning that his life's work demanded.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In King's day, this faction was known as the \"Massive Resistance,\" an effort to organize and frustrate the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education ruling and efforts to build multiracial classrooms. Today, this faction is known as the \"anti-CRT\" effort, which seeks to proscribe race-related curricula, books or trainings that offer a discomforting view of our past and its current implications.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Teachers, public officials and students are in a particularly unsustainable bind. They're charged with honoring King as a figure while disavowing the ideas that he lived and died to advance. They're being asked not merely to defer King's dream of racial equality but to decommission it altogether.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>King would likely take bitter note of the all-too-familiar dynamics behind today's backlash. After the 2020 global movement for racial justice in the United States and beyond in the wake of the savage police killing of George Floyd, legislatures in 32 states have relied on what is patently a lie -- that antiracism is antiwhite -- to fuel the antidemocratic crusade against what they call \"critical race theory.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For more than 30 years, scholars have employed critical race theory as an analytical tool. The right has rebranded it as the new racism, as wokeness run amok, as a threat to innocent schoolchildren and as a stalking-horse for the demise of \"Western civilization\" itself. The theory has become the target of coordinated efforts to stigmatize and erase generations of antiracist knowledge, advocacy and history. The objective is both to disappear antiracism's history and to deny its contemporary salience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>King himself is a prime casualty in this effort. Apostles of the McCarthyite crackdown on critical race theory have exploited him as a mouthpiece for their cause, reducing him to a solitary, decontextualized line from the \"I Have a Dream\" speech about a future in which his four children were to be judged not \"by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some use King's words to erase his deeds and those of millions more who rose up to \"make good the promises\" since Reconstruction. In Tennessee, for example, the Moms for Liberty sought to ban Frances E. Ruffin's children's book \"Martin Luther King Jr. and the March on Washington\" by framing its descriptions of segregation and the violence meted out against King and others as traumatizing and racist. The Moms argue that Ruffin's portrayal of white racism against people of color \"will sow the seeds of racial strife, neo-racism, neo-segregation, and is an affront\" to King's ideals. This reveals precisely what comes of a persistent and willful ignorance of King's legacy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The sheer power on display to turn King against himself -- a process that has been underway since the first day this holiday was celebrated -- is a grim reflection of the way opponents have long subjected antiracist thinking and activism to distortion, misappropriation and redefinition. The brazen casting of critical race theory as the contemporary villain following 2020's racial reckoning is no surprise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The King holiday and Black History Month are an excellent opportunity -- perhaps the only opportunity -- to course-correct, contest and redirect the misconceptions about King's legacy and its interface with critical race theory. Recovering the real King begins by freeing his image from the clutches of those seeking to substitute truthful education with a saccharine narrative built on illusions, delusions and lies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dr. King was an \"inconvenient truth teller.\" His insistence on the urgency of racial justice put him at odds with moderate whites in the South, and his denunciation of imperialism put him at odds with allies more narrowly focused on the freedom struggle within U.S. borders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For telling these truths, in life, King was often criticized rather than celebrated. At the time of his death, polls showed that most white people held an unfavorable view of him. The FBI, under J. Edgar Hoover, framed him as a national security threat. Some Black leaders were hardly convinced of his tactics -- his civil disobedience was too radical for some, his nonviolence too accommodationist for others. But for King, the demands for racial justice were not to be won through a popularity contest or by painting a comforting picture of the U.S. social order. Nor was King's an identity-obsessed demand for recognition. He offered a clear-eyed assessment of a would-be democracy in a state of disrepair. Confronting it at its source was the only way forward.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's no accident that the firestorm over critical race theory has singed King's message: King was, in fact, a critical race theorist before there was a name for it. A core observation of the theory is the recognition that the promise of liberation extends beyond the elimination of formal segregation and individual-level prejudice. Critical race theory explores how racial inequality was historically structured into the fabric of the republic, reinforced by law, insulated by the founding Constitution and embedded into the infrastructure of American society. Similarly, King observed in 1967 that \"the doctrine of white supremacy was embedded in every textbook and preached in practically every pulpit,\" entrenched as \"a structural part of the culture.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Accordingly, King's appeal in the March on Washington in 1963 was grounded in the assertion that the promise of a fully inclusive American democracy -- one that lived up to its oft-stated ideals -- required creative confrontation with a republic out of step with its promises. He rebuffed those who found fault in the tensions created by placing our norms and our realities in sharp relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>King famously wrote a letter rejecting the counsel of white moderate allies who argued for a gradualist accommodation to the prioritized sensibilities of those who didn't experience the sting of segregation. As a father, he conveyed the anguish of his own children, who couldn't understand why they weren't allowed into the Funtown amusement park, which barred Black visitors, while the joy of white children was privileged. He argued elsewhere that \"justice for black people cannot be achieved without radical changes in the structure of our society.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>King centered the promise of equal access to the ballot -- now under concerted assault -- at the heart of his prophetic mission. He fought to win passage of both the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, and he understood that the provisions of each law were part and parcel of the same struggle for true and lasting racial justice. While he hailed the landmark voting reform as \"a great step forward in removing all of the remaining obstacles to the right to vote,\" he also insisted that the vote be used to \"rid the American body politic of racism.\" King would instantly recognize the mutually reinforcing objectives of denying the ballot, an indispensable instrument of reform, while also silencing the substantive case for reform by whitewashing the country's racial past.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Contrary to countless assertions from the right, King did not endorse colorblindness. It wasn't the remedy for dismantling the ugly realities that white supremacy had produced. Like today's critical race theorists, King understood that American racism was systemic and demanded systemic remedies. He was forthright in acknowledging that anti-Black racism \"was not a consequence of superficial prejudice but was systemic.\" Throughout his career, King set his sights on institutional-level change, calling for solutions built on the race-conscious analysis of inequalities across our society.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>King invoked a \"bank of justice\" to be mobilized against the many structures of racial oppression to ultimately realize \"the security of justice\" for all Americans. This commitment explicitly extended to the mode of race-conscious practice that now goes by the name of affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When questioned whether he would support such outlays, King bluntly replied, \"I do indeed,\" and went on to explain: \"Can any fair-minded citizen deny that the Negro has been deprived? Few people reflect that for two centuries the Negro was enslaved and robbed of any wages -- potential accrued wealth which would have been the legacy of his descendants. All of America's wealth today could not adequately compensate its Negroes for his centuries of exploitation and humiliation.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Much of King's legacy may never be taught in public schools, if this manufactured panic that demands critical thinking about racism be expunged from curricula and libraries continues. In North Dakota, for example, King's understanding of structural racism would contradict the state's newly minted edict that racism cannot be taught as anything more than an individual's prejudice and bias. His understanding of the historical debt created by centuries of uncompensated labor flies directly in the face of Oklahoma's prohibition of material suggesting that current generations bear any responsibility for the actions of their ancestors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not only did King clearly recognize that antiracism must address built-in headwinds that unnecessarily disadvantage some groups over others, but so does, incidentally, the Supreme Court, as seen in its many rulings. Yet an instructor seeking to explain King's expansive vision of justice or a professor highlighting legal cases about institutional discrimination will be in jeopardy if they teach these ideas in some states that have adopted such laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>King's ideas could also fall under efforts in states such as Oklahoma or Texas that forbid the use of classroom materials that might create guilt or discomfort in public school students. King's description of a social order in need of repair would trigger complaints that current generations are made to feel responsible for the sins of our past. New Hampshire, meanwhile, has proposed legislation forbidding antiracist critiques of the nation's founding and history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indeed, under most of these laws, King's concrete work and documented analysis of racism's enduring legacy in American society would be suspect. In his final speech, on the eve of his death, he said he might not get to the promised land with us. This prophecy would rest uneasily in curricula that sanction assumptions that we haven't already become that society that King dreamed we would one day be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This imposition of a fairy-tale account of America makes King's sacrifice utterly illegible. It is a memory-holed vision of the past better suited to George Orwell's dystopian reveries than to a nation seeking to redeem its promise of genuine, expansive and democratic self-rule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nationwide, lawmakers are legislating that our schools and workplaces turn away from King's mandate to make good on the country's broken promises, and wallow instead in the wages of this ignorance. It is an ignorance that grows out of an earlier effort to impose an approved orthodoxy about the American past. One of the enduring consequences of the United Daughters of the Confederacy's textbook campaigns was the persistence of Confederate propaganda and Lost Cause mythology masquerading as the truth about the history of the Civil War and its aftermath. The United Daughters ensured that millions of children inherited a view of America's past grossly warped by the whitewashing of slavery and the violent Redemption, when white Southerners called for a return to white supremacy, that followed Reconstruction. The democratic crisis we face today is an unrecognizable spasm from that past, illegible in part because our educational system and national myths have not overcome these past manipulations to embrace this history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To truly honor King's memory, then, we must defeat the faction that facilitated the U.S. Capitol riot, put democracy on life support and continues to demand that critical interrogation of its past be censored by law. King implored that we put our bodies on the line to face the organized forces of white reaction in his day -- and it's clear that he'd be fighting in exactly the same way to preserve his prophetic legacy in our own day, when the right to equal education, to vote freely and to realize true cross-racial justice are once more under bitter attack.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reclaiming his legacy is to realize that there is no daylight between a truly democratic society and a racially just one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: PHOTO: DEMONSTRATORS in Birmingham, Ala., are led by Revs. Martin Luther King Jr., right, and Ralph Abernathy in 1963.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTOGRAPHER:Horace Cort Associated Press</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Kimberle Williams Crenshaw is a professor at the Columbia and UCLA law schools and executive director of the African American Policy Forum.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398664782.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Is Yankee Stadium a `Level Playing Field'?</h2<p>Correction</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The book \"Women's Figures\" was written by two scholars, one from the American Enterprise Institute and one from the Independent Women's Forum. This was misstated in Wednesday's editorial feature \"Is Yankee Stadium a `Level Playing Field'?\" (WSJ Oct. 29, 1999)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"A level playing field\" is one of those pious expressions that everyone seems to agree on, even when they mean completely different things by it. Wherever there is intellectual confusion, there is also likely to be political dishonesty, in order to take advantage of it. \"A level playing field\" is no exception.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have been playing on level playing fields for all of the past 80 years -- during which time the Yanks have won 24 world championships and the Red Sox none. Many of those who talk about a \"level playing field\" in terms of statistical results would have to claim that Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park are tilted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those of us who believe in traditional concepts of fairness or justice regard the playing field as level when everyone plays by the same rules and gets judged by the same standards -- regardless of what the outcome may be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In spite of some dubious umpire's calls during the recent Yankees-Red Sox series, the reason 24 world championship flags are flying at Yankee Stadium is not because of bad calls by umpires. You are better off believing in the curse of the Bambino than you are claiming that the Yankees and Red Sox have not been playing by the same rules and being judged by the same standards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Advocates of affirmative action, \"comparable worth\" and other government attempts to make results fit preconceptions not only define fairness or a level playing field by results, too often they also try to claim that statistical differences prove unfairness by traditional standards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A recent letter to the editors of this newspaper by a comparable-worth \"expert\" claimed that pay schedules \"are carefully manipulated behind the scenes to perpetuate discounted pay for `women's work.'\" Evidence for this nefarious activity was of course omitted. Indeed such admissions have been institutionalized in the concept of a \"glass ceiling\" -- a lack of evidence being treated as just being invisible evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Much the same game has been played with racial statistics, where unequal results are treated as evidence of discrimination or a tilted playing field. Apparently nobody can lose on a level playing field, the Red Sox to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since there is no specific law mandating equal representation of all groups in all activities, activists and judges -- sometimes the same people -- have been forced to claim that discrimination in the traditional sense of differential treatment must be present if the numbers don't work out the way they think they should. Yet there is nothing faintly resembling such an even representation of groups occurring spontaneously in any country around the world or in any period of history. Only quotas and preferences produce even representation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The dishonesty of this pretense of random distribution in the absence of discrimination pervades and corrupts not only arguments but institutions, including the highest courts in the land. Its dishonesty is revealed in the highly selective way it is applied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When black applicants for mortgage loans are turned down more often than white applicants, that is trumpeted through the media as proof of racial discrimination. But when the very same data show whites being turned down more often than Asian-Americans who apply for mortgage loans, silence reigns. Does anyone claim that basketball discriminates against whites? The statistical disparities there are far greater than in mortgage applications -- most of which are accepted, whether filed by black or white applicants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The simple fact is that groups differ in their performances, whether they are baseball teams, races, sexes or a thousand other groupings of human beings. Given all the underlying factors -- demographic, geographic, historical -- that differ from one group to another, it would be the miracle of the ages if they did not differ.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even when particular groups are similar in income, such as Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans, they can differ by large amounts in rates of alcoholism. Almost all comparisons of groups are comparisons of apples and oranges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most thorough debunking of the \"glass ceiling\" claim as it applies to male-female economic differences is the recently published edition of \"Women's Figures\" by two women scholars at the American Enterprise Institute. Those who prefer bogeyman theories should at least read the other side -- if only for the sake of a level playing field.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Sowell, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, is author most recently of \"The Quest for Cosmic Justice\" (Free Press).</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/419768947.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Diversity by racial experience, not by race</h2<p>President Bush has it just right--it's not race that matters, but racial experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With the president's concurrence, the U.S. solicitor general filed a brief last week that opposes the mindless use of race in public university admissions, while being mindful that racism still exists in America.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has made it plain that, except in highly limited and overwhelmingly remedial circumstances, race should never be used in public decision-making. That is as it should be. Equal protection of the law is denied, not advanced, when public institutions selectively favor some minority groups over others, and all minorities over non-minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A little more than 20 years ago, one justice of the court, in a highly fractured opinion, suggested race could also be used by public universities as a \"plus factor\" to achieve a diverse student body.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Justice Lewis Powell's personal suggestion seemed benign in University of California vs. Bakke, but it has since become a wholesale invitation to public university admissions committees to mechanically admit students who have questionable academic credentials and records merely because they self-identify themselves as falling within a favored category.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This auto-pilot diversity rationale is exactly what the University of Michigan has been employing. In the undergraduate school, race was worth an automatic 20 points, which virtually assured admission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the law school, the disparity was more subtle, but often greater. A white or Asian applicant with a 164-66 test score and 3.25-3.49 grade point average had a 22 percent chance of admission, while an African-American with the same numbers was always admitted. As one of the lower court judges put it, this didn't enhance chances of admission, it guaranteed it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indulged over time, practices like these are a quota built on soft bigotry and low expectations--exactly what the court rejected in Bakke. Patronizing double standards, as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas once observed, \"engender attitudes of superiority, or alternatively, provoke resentment. ... [They] stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All that said, the pivotal vote in the Michigan case presently before the high court will be that of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. In prior race cases, she has largely supported limiting the use of race to the compelling necessity to remedy past discrimination. But she has also stated that she wished \"to dispel the notion that the strict scrutiny applied in the court's review is `strict in theory, but fatal in fact.'\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And in this, O'Connor and Bush share the same reality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is one that knows that, in the justice's words, \"the unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination\" remain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many conservative voices called for the president to categorically take a position against diversity. Prudently, he has not. Instead, he has courageously urged that the court not try to remedy one evil with another, but to sensitively examine the life experience of college and law school applicants to see if they have achieved notwithstanding the sting of racism in their lives. Such experience, unlike nominal racial selection, adds meaningful diversity and educates by the strength of the applicant's character.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Michigan claimed it wanted diversified student experiences in their classes, but what it really wanted was a class that merely looked like it had that. There are far more direct, and non-racial ways, to be inclusive. In announcing his Supreme Court position, the president cited some of them based on his experience in Texas, but California and Florida have also traveled a good distance toward ensuring diversity of experience by guaranteeing admission to the top students of schools statewide. A university cannot possibly justify the odious use of skin color in an admissions process until it has first sought out applicants raised in poverty or those applying from underfunded schools or those who have achieved greatly, despite the drawbacks that still linger in family histories suffused with subtle racial exclusions from jobs, housing or other opportunities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925 on March 6, 1961, he added the term \"affirmative action\" to our national vocabulary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is often forgotten, however, that the order directed government contractors to \"take affirmative action, to ensure that applicants are employed, ... without regard to their race, creed, color or national origin.\" In filing against the University of Michigan and its highly race-conscious policies, President Bush does not forsake President Kennedy's initiative, he vindicates it.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/408582223.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>OUCH!; At the End of Life, Color Still Divides</h2<p>I once suggested \"palliative care\" to a patient of mine--a black man who was dying of cancer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Dr. Payne,\" he replied to my offer of what I considered a painless and dignified death, \"do you talk to all of your patients about this?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among African Americans, my patient is not alone in resisting efforts to free him from the sort of fate many white Americans say they fear: a painful death while tied to machines that sustain life at great human and financial cost. African Americans are significantly less likely to prepare a living will, to talk to their doctors about end-of-life care or to participate in a hospice program. When death is inevitable and imminent, blacks are twice as likely as whites to request life-sustaining treatments that can make dying a miserable experience for both patients and their families.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As an African American physician trained in pain management and palliative and end-of-life care, I have been asking myself what can be done to address these attitudes among black Americans. The answer is important because doctors who treat African American patients should understand that there may be differences in the way patient and doctor would choose to die. In addressing this resistance, we may succeed in giving many African Americans the gift of \"a good death\"-- when death is the only possible outcome.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Few people--patients or doctors--understand or request palliative care, an increasingly common approach to care at the end of life. With palliative care, both the patient and doctor recognize that though the disease cannot be cured, some quality of life can remain. This form of care focuses far less on life-saving measures than on relief of pain and other physical symptoms while it addresses the patient's emotional, social and spiritual needs. It does not treat the person as if he or she is on the brink of death. Indeed, it neither hastens nor postpones death. It simply recognizes that life can be meaningful and rewarding even if one is diagnosed with a terminal illness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In my experience many patients, especially African Americans and members of other medically under-served minority groups, tend to think of \"palliative care\" as \"giving up hope.\" I suspect this is so because many African Americans fear their cultural and personal values will not be respected when they are dying. They sometimes worry that their race and socioeconomic status make them more \"disposable\" and that treatment decisions will reflect that attitude. They do not see palliative and hospice care as offering better care at the end of life. Many worry, as my patient did, that palliative care is really a code word for \"no care\" or \"less care.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Statistics indicate that many African Americans do not have access to good health care. For example, a report published in October in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that African Americans with lung cancer are less likely to undergo surgery--and therefore less likely to survive the disease--than white patients.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Physicians, nurses and other health care providers in hospital settings should be better educated in pain management and palliative care. This training should include a greater understanding of differences in the way blacks and whites may perceive end-of-life care. African Americans would be more likely to respond positively to providers who are specifically trained to discuss alternatives to life-sustaining treatments with minority-group patients.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because studies indicate that most minority communities are served predominantly by minority physicians, affirmative action programs at medical schools should be maintained and perhaps expanded. This would improve minority communities' access both to health care in general and to physicians who are sensitive to minority attitudes toward end- of-life care.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pharmacies in minority neighborhoods should be encouraged to carry the opioids and other controlled substances necessary to provide adequate pain relief to area residents for whom such medication has been prescribed. Medications essential for treatment of pain, infections and other conditions must be affordable and accessible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As we try to implement these ideas, we will encounter a skeptical audience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A few years ago in Houston, I invited a group of African American clergymen to hear about alternatives for end-of-life care, hoping they would pass on the message to their flocks. They listened politely and then said, in essence: \"How can you ask us to trust an institution that one generation ago would not let us in the door? And given our goal of gaining greater access to cancer care, why are you talking about limiting access to treatment at the end of life?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The medical community's long, sorry history of racism and unethical behavior toward African Americans must be acknowledged and corrected. And then we must move beyond this to help African Americans improve access to all medical services, including palliative and hospice care--which will allow us to die \"the good death\" to which we are all entitled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Richard Payne is chief of the pain and palliative care service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1268871346.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Elite colleges miss the mark</h2<p>A few years ago, Harvard University startled the academic world by offering what many would call a form of class-based affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Essentially, the elite university offered a free college education to high-achieving students whose families earned less than $40,000 a year. Other elite schools, including Yale, Princeton and Stanford, have made similar offers in various ways, and Harvard, among others, has since raised the financial bar to $60,000 a year.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How has it worked out? Not as well as many had hoped.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One study of the Harvard initiative's first year found that the number of students whose family income fell below the threshold increased by only about 15 students in a class of about 1,650 freshmen.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Officials at Harvard and other colleges with similar offers lament that there is not a large enough pool of high-achieving low-income students and that there's not much colleges can do to change that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But that widespread belief is disputed by a new study by economist Caroline Hoxby at Stanford and Christopher Avery at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They looked at the 236 colleges and universities viewed as \"most competitive\" in Barron's Profiles of American Colleges and at high school seniors whose grades and college aptitude test scores in the top 4 percent nationwide or the top 10 percent of students who take the ACT or SAT college assessment exams.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Their analysis, published in December, finds a surprisingly abundant supply of high-achieving low-income students who are not applying to selective colleges, even though \"selective institutions would often cost them less, owing to generous financial aid, than the resource-poor two-year and non-selective four-year institutions to which they actually apply.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those who do apply to selective institutions are admitted and graduate at high rates, the study points out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Why are students and their families passing up these opportunities? More than anything else, Hoxby and Avery conclude, the students simply don't know what they're missing -- and they don't know because nobody is telling them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some 70 percent of gifted low-income students came from 15 large metropolitan areas, the study found. Most attend highly respected public magnet schools where elite colleges have long-established contacts with high school counselors and other informal talent scouts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Students at such schools also are more likely to talk about and apply to elite schools as an option than students at schools, families or communities who view such colleges as faraway havens for snooty elites.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The students whom they (colleges) see are the students who apply,\" Hoxby told NPR science correspondent Shankar Vedantam in a recent interview. \"And if a student doesn't apply to any selective college or university, it's impossible for admissions staff to see that they are out there.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Colleges need to broaden their searches to more cities and smaller towns. The high schools and local communities also owe it to their promising students to improve their own outreach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The success or failure of income-based outreach by elite colleges is important to the rest of us too.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With the U.S. Supreme Court looking at the future of affirmative action by universities, income-based diversity efforts in any form excite those of us who have been looking for alternatives to race-based affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Harvard model strives to offer the merit-based model that critics of affirmative action have idealized as a return to merit-based academic rewards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The Hoxby-Avery study offers further evidence that universities are more about racial diversity than economic diversity,\" said Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a longtime advocate of class-based outreach. \"But they don't seem to have the same appetite to go out and recruit low-income students of all races.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Or to paraphrase the Rev.

Political pundits spent lots of time arguing over whether it would ever awaken and what might happen when it did. Last week's primary voting settled that argument, once and for all. The giant is not just stirring but wide awake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Sleeping giant\" is the term used by political pros since at least 1960 to describe California's large but politically impotent Latino population. In 1996, after Latino voters helped President Clinton win California, Arizona and Florida in the general election, I suggested the term was outdated, but that was disputed in some quarters. I don't expect disagreement now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A big Latino turnout--12% of all California voters, double the number of Latinos who voted in the '94 primary--played a pivotal role in key election contests.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Latino voters helped ensure that four Latinos will be candidates for statewide office in November:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Former Speaker of the Assembly Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat from the Fresno area, will run for lieutenant governor against Republican State Sen. Tim Leslie of Tahoe City.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* San Mateo County Supervisor Ruben Barrales won the Republican Party's nomination to oppose state Controller Kathleen Connell's bid for reelection.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Democratic Assemblywoman Diana Martinez of Monterey Park will oppose the reelection bid of state Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Santa Ana schoolteacher Gloria Matta Tuchman will oppose incumbent Delaine Eastin in the state superintendent of public instruction's race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If any one of those four wins, it will be the first time since 1871--when Romualdo Pacheco was elected lieutenant governor--that a person of Latin American extraction has held statewide political office in California.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even if none of these statewide candidates wins, Latinos are assured of playing a bigger role in the Legislature and in key local offices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of the 20 state Senate seats to be filled in November, seven have Latino candidates. If voters in those districts follow past voting patterns, at least two Latino candidates should win, bringing the total number of Latino senators to six.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of the 80 Assembly seats on the line in November, 25 have Latino candidates. There are already 14 Latinos in the Assembly, so only two more seats would give Latinos 20% of that body's votes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Latinos were also vitally interested in the two most closely watched initiatives on the ballot, Propositions 226 and 227.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proposition 226 would have forced labor unions to get their individual members' permission to donate money to political campaigns. It was defeated 53% to 47%, but a Times exit poll indicates the vote would have been closer except for the fact that 75% of Latino voters--many of them union members--cast ballots against it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proposition 227, the controversial initiative banning bilingual education in California public schools, won easily. But it was opposed by two-thirds of Latino voters, according to The Times' exit poll.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Proposition 227 vote may seem to run counter to the trend of Latino voting success. But even that defeat can be seen as a moral victory for Latino activists, who fiercely opposed the measure despite early public opinion polls that showed a majority of Latinos in favor of it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although the campaign against Proposition 227 did not persuade a majority of California voters to change their minds, it did win over the growing Latino electorate. Latino activists proved that when they set out on a unified course of political action, they can sway significant numbers of Latino voters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Proposition 227 also will provide new ammunition for future Latino political campaigns. Activists will now link it with 1994's Proposition 187, which barred illegal immigrants from public schools and social services, and 1996's Proposition 209, which bans affirmative action in public education and contracts, as expressions of anti-minority sentiment by California's older, mostly white voting majority. That will keep Latino voters in a defensive stance for some time--on the lookout for propositions or candidates deemed anti-Latino.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This us-against-them politics is unfortunate, but not all bad. For it makes it less likely that ambitious politicians will stake out negative positions like those taken--to cite a bipartisan example--by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in 1994, when both campaigned on promises to get tough on illegal immigrants. The risks of such divisive \"wedge\" campaigns are just too great now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So the giant is awake. But thankfully not angry, just wary. It's time for politicos in both parties to get over their own fears and find constructive ways to use the giant's strength, youth and energy to help build a better California.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTO: Frank del Olmo</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Frank del Olmo is assistant to the editor of The Times and a regular columnist</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2833868046.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>East is East: Identity Politics Could Kill America's Scientific Edge</h2<p>There are many reasons to oppose the sort of race-based affirmative action that the Supreme Court recently struck down at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. Most Americans find judging people by their skin color morally repugnant; Harvard's policies cruelly stereotyped Asian-Americans as impersonable to keep their numbers down; and race-based policies replace the dream of a colorblind society with an unhealthy obsession with group identities -- to name a few.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But one particular reason deserves more attention: It's good for national security. The high court's ruling could better equip America to thwart China's effort to lead the world by overtaking the West in science and technology.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Though the U.S. has long ruled those realms, China is catching up fast. Washington has begun to address this problem in recent years. But as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and artificial intelligence expert Yll Bajraktari warned in a Foreign Affairs piece last year, it's \"hard to say with any confidence\" that the U.S. is \"better positioned or organized for the long-term contest\" with China than it was a few years ago. \"It is entirely possible to imagine a future where systems designed, built, and based in China dominate world markets, extending Beijing's sphere of influence and providing it with a military advantage over the United States.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unlike the former Soviet Union, whose scientific prowess was limited to a handful of domains, China has emerged as a genuine rival to America. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute reported this year that China leads the U.S. in research on 37 of 44 critical technologies, including advanced aircraft engines, electric batteries, machine learning and synthetic biology. In a recent essay in Foreign Affairs, Dan Wang, an expert on China's technology landscape, wrote that \"China now rivals Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan in its mastery of the electronics supply chain.\" In 2007, the Chinese added less than 4% of the value-added costs of iPhones made in that country. Now it's more than 25%.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>China leads the world in modern infrastructure such as high-voltage power lines, high-speed rail and 5G telecom networks. It controls most solar-panel production, houses the world's largest electric-car battery company, CATL, and is racing to catch up with the West in high-end semiconductors. In Mr. Wang's telling, Shenzhen has come to resemble the San Francisco Bay Area, \"where university researchers, entrepreneurs, workers, and investors continually rub elbows.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given this challenge, you might imagine that America would re-emphasize the principles of objectivity and merit that made it the world's leading scientific innovator. You would be mistaken.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Where it once was taken for granted that expanding knowledge was more important than a scientist's sex or skin color, anyone adhering to that approach in the U.S. now must fend off charges that it is racist, patriarchal, colonial, or a tool of oppression. As a group of 29 scientists and academics contended in a recent paper for the Journal of Controversial Ideas, scientific progress in the West \"is being hindered by a new, alarming clash between liberal epistemology and identity-based ideologies.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Instead of fighting back, traditional gatekeeping institutions seem to have become part of the problem. In 2020 the Lancet published a paper on \"Adopting an intersectionality framework to address power and equity in medicine.\" Last year Nature published an article titled \"Seeding an anti-racist culture at Scotland's botanical gardens.\" In 2018, Scientific American declared that \"the idea of 2 sexes is overly simplistic.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thirty years ago, when the U.S. lead over all other countries seemed insurmountable, we could arguably afford to humor activists who believe in decolonizing pharmacology or insist that science is bigoted because cutting-edge research output doesn't meet some race or sex quota. But China's rapid rise -- driven in part by a brutally meritocratic exam system that focuses on test scores -- means we no longer have that luxury.

{"id": "txt/398840063.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Bilingual Science</h2<p>California citizens have watched distraught over the years as lawyers tied up propositions on changes ranging from affirmative action (Prop 209) to term limits (Prop 140, eight years in court). Now the thought police is busy trying to straitjacket this season's expression of democracy, Prop 227, a landmark ballot measure to curtail bilingual education's excesses that passed by a very democratic 61%.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This time, though, the court battle may be one to look forward to. For a change, the Prop 227 case seems to have landed in the care of a reasonable judge named Charles Legge. The San Jose Mercury News reports that the judge told another paper that \"You won't find me bringing down the barricades with the liberals. But you also will not find me putting up barricades.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then there is the matter of the case. The lawyers are insisting Prop 227 violates federal civil rights law, EEOC prescript, and -- what else? -- the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. But there is no clear precedent of a federal court forcing a state to provide bilingual ed when its citizens oppose that. So when the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, Multicultural Education Training and Advocacy Inc. and the rest of the bilingual mafia sally into Judge Legge's court with a request for a preliminary injunction, they won't have much to argue with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indeed, to judge from their three-inch brief, the opponents of Prop 227 are going to concentrate on another angle. Prop 227 will immerse children who don't know English in a special, intensive, one-year program, then transfer them to regular classes. The lawyers are going to argue this will cause irreparable damage to kids, a criterion for obtaining an injunction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's the basic argument that built bilingual ed: kids need five or more years in special classes before they can learn English. In other words these folks have talked themselves into believing an amazing thing: that to learn English, kids shouldn't learn in English. Stephen Krashen, one of bilingual ed's bigger gurus, provided a nice example of bilingual ed think in an April 17 letter to the Orange County Register: \"A limited English proficient child who has learned math through the primary language, and thus has a good background in math, will understand much more in math class taught in English than a limited English proficient child without this background.\" And we thought math was about the universal language of numbers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the evidence in court will show that it is the old program, not Prop 227, that does the \"irreparable damage.\" California's bilingual ed program has been up and running for many years, plenty of time to yield data on the consequences of four, or five, or seven years in the bilingual barrio. And that data look terrible. High schoolers often dropped out in despair when they realized they couldn't perform in the English world they had been kept from. High schoolers in Los Lunas, N.M. even walked out of school to protest the obsessive Spanish focus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The greater point is that America has had a whole mountain of empirical evidence to counter the arguments of the MALDEFs and their scholars. We are a nation of immigrants. Most of us, or our parents or grandparents, had to learn English in an intimidating situation. And yet they did, often successfully enough to enjoy prosperous, if lightly accented, careers. It's time to give newer immigrants the same chance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Data Support Bilingual Education\" -- WSJ July 6,1998)</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/430098623.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Editorial Notebook; The Presumption of Stupidity</h2<p>Brent Staples is a waspish name: A few times a year, every year, readers write in to tell me this. Most of the writers are good-natured folks who imagined me a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant until something put them wise that I am black. Some are rabid, and even accuse me of faking the name to pass for white. Though different in intent, the two sets of letters have something in common: surprise that a preconception related to race has failed to be true.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Preconceptions about race are often deeply held -- even unconscious -- and thoroughly blinding. By way of example, consider the psychologist Gordon Allport's pioneering studies on prejudice. Allport would begin his classes by showing two pictures: one of a black man unarmed, one of a white man holding a knife. After the lecture, he asked the class who had the knife. The black man, of course. The presumption of criminality had caused the knife to take legs and walk.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most venomous preconception has to do not with criminality but with stupidity -- or as the neo-eugenicists put it these days, the presumption that intelligence is inherited. For young black boys in the inner city, the presumption of stupidity comes into play early and never lets up. The consequences can be disastrous. Jack Kemp, former Housing Secretary and N.F.L. quarterback, said as much when he observed that, until only recently, black football players were universally regarded as too dumb to play quarterback. This example reduces racism to its most pernicious axiom: that brain work is \"white\" and brawn work is irrevocably \"black.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That myth is deeply etched into law and cultural iconography. It was the cornerstone of slavery and, later, of segregation, whose central premise was that blacks did not deserve education because they were too dense to absorb it. The simple-minded darkie once so favored in the movies supported this view.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given that history, it is absurd to argue, as many critics do, that affirmative action has placed African-Americans under suspicion of incompetence, by propelling them into positions they do not rightly deserve. Bred into this country's bones, the presumption that blacks are inherently less \"qualified\" would be a driving force in any case. An alternative view of affirmative action is that it breaks down occupational apartheid, the notion that elite jobs are for white folks only. The process is wrenching, but how could it be otherwise?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The letters that accuse me of fabricating my \"white\" name invariably question my qualifications. I bet you got your job through affirmative action, they sneer. Not the job, but certainly the education and opportunities that led to it. In the dying factory town where I grew up, black boys who were not middle class were stamped \"not college material,\" and shunted toward menial and factory jobs that would soon cease to exist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In high school, I was an average student, with no plans for college. Providence appeared in the form of a professor from Widener University who talked me into going to college one afternoon on a street corner. I was accepted without S.A.T.'s, but took them for ceremonial purposes. My scores were unimpressive, and the college was right not to care. Often the scores tell more about privilege than about \"merit\" or potential to succeed. I graduated 26th in a class of 370 at Widener, well ahead of many white prep-school kids who had done well on the S.A.T.'s. This black boy who was \"not college material\" went on to earn a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are thousands of stories like this one. But in the Reaganaut 80's, many African-Americans who could tell those stories became converts to the gospel of Horatio Alger, suddenly claiming that success had been earned through hard work and rectitude alone. Poverty, they say, stems from sloth and moral laxness. The convert's role I will never play.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I was 17, the society spotted me a few points on the S.A.T.'s and changed my life. I became a writer -- and a middle-class taxpayer -- as many other black men went on to prisons, cemeteries and homeless shelters. Sounds like a smart investment to me. The country would be wise to keep making it. BRENT STAPLES</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398808910.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Do the Right Thing</h2<p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger, two related cases that many believe will be the most important civil rights lawsuits in a generation. Their outcomes will determine if Barbara Grutter and Jennifer Gratz, two white women whose grades and test scores should have ensured their acceptance to the University of Michigan law school and undergraduate program respectively, were unfairly rejected because the school gave admission preferences to minority applicants in order to have a \"diverse\" student body.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The pivotal issue in Grutter and Gratz -- one that has bedeviled the courts, to say nothing of the havoc wrought on admissions offices and the unfairness caused to millions of college-bound students -- is whether \"diversity\" is a compelling enough justification to use racial and ethnic classifications and preferences in deciding who will, or won't, be admitted to a university.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This was the essence of Board of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a landmark 1978 Supreme Court case. That case continues to offer only a muddled answer to the question of whether the pursuit of diversity justifies racial and ethnic preferences in school admissions. Courts in Texas and Georgia have concluded from Bakke that a student's race can't be an element to achieve diversity, while courts in Michigan and Washington State have come to the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because the federal government is not a party to this lawsuit, it is possible -- although unlikely -- that the Bush administration can simply sit this one out and not offer the court any guidance, a posture perceived by some administration insiders as the most politically expedient course to take. However, saying nothing about a case of this magnitude would be highly unusual and, moreover, would concede the high ground to those who will criticize the president's civil-rights record regardless of what he does here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- The Right Argument. The correct legal position the Bush administration should take is one in which they argue that the so-called \"diversity rationale\" for preferences is constitutionally insufficient to justify discrimination on the basis of skin color or where a student's ancestors came from. Furthermore, they should contend that achieving skin-color diversity assumes that all racial minorities are simply interchangeable with one another: Any black student in a college class will bring a \"black\" perspective to the discussion and the learning experience: it doesn't matter if he or she attended an impoverished inner-city high school or a chic prep school, black or brown skin creates diversity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- The Wrong Argument. If the Bush administration casts its lot with the U. of M., it will argue that the rewards of \"diversity\" -- or, in reality, a student body that is proportionate to the nation's racial and ethnic populations -- is so beneficial to everyone, that admitting or rejecting students because of skin color is permissible. The university claims it \"proved\" this hypothesis when it offered the trial court a massive study conducted by the U. of M. quantitatively demonstrating diversity's benefits, although objective social scientists have questioned the methodology and validity of the study's findings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- The Split-the-Baby Argument. Even if educational diversity at the U. of M. and other public universities is important enough to justify a thumb on the scale in favor of certain preferred minorities, the school's racial preference policies must be fashioned in a way that is \"narrowly tailored\" -- in other words, the implementation of racial preferences must be accomplished through laser surgery, rather than a shotgun approach. In the real world of college admissions policies, this means the thumb on the scale can't be too heavy. The administration could have it both ways by arguing that, yes, diversity is a compelling justification for preferences but, no, in this instance, the U. of M. didn't properly craft its policies to achieve this goal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This last argument -- discrimination is permissible so long as it is narrowly tailored -- will result in endless years of legal wrangling, guaranteeing our colleges and universities will be kept in total fog with regard to admissions policies. This is little more than arguing for the status quo.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The country has benefited enormously from President Bush's unequivocal stand on our most critically important foreign and domestic issues. Now is not the time, nor is this the case, to expect anything less from him and his administration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Messrs.

{"id": "txt/2098152851.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Asian-American Age</h2<p>This past week the Trump Justice Department threw its weight behind a high-profile lawsuit against Harvard University , in which a group of Asian-American plaintiffs claim \u2014 with a great deal of evidence \u2014 that the famous Ivy school discriminates against them as it once discriminated against Jews. This happened in the same moment that the No. 1 movie in America is \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d a guilty-pleasure romantic comedy about a young female Chinese-American economist in love with a Singaporean heir.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The convergence illustrates an underrated reality about Trump-era America. Our polarizing immigration debate revolves around the Wall and the border because we\u2019ve just experienced a long wave of immigration from our southern neighbors. But that surge is diminishing, and for almost a decade the United States has taken more Asian than Hispanic immigration. So after the Trumpian moment passes, our ethno-political fights will be gradually reshaped by how Asians relate to American culture, how American politics relates to them, and how they (because \"Asian\" contains multitudes) relate to one another.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In my lifetime there have been two stories about where Asian-Americans fit in our domestic coalitions. In the Reagan \u201980s they were seen as the most Republican-friendly immigrant group \u2014 more educated and prosperous than other immigrants, often anti-Communist (in the case of the Vietnamese and Taiwanese especially), bearing Confucian or Christian values that aligned with a traditional-values G.O.P.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But then from the Clinton era on Asian voters swung toward the Democratic Party \u2014 a shift that probably reflected changes in immigrant composition (more South Asians relative to East Asians, more non-Christians relative to Christians), the declining salience of anti-Communism, and a reaction to the G.O.P.\u2019s continued rightward shift and white-Southern-Christian brand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This, in turn, led to a new story that cast Asian-Americans as a natural constituency in an emerging Democratic majority \u2014 one tributary among many in the multicultural river washing white hegemony away.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The term \u201cmodel minority\u201d often gets thrown around (and deplored) in discussions about Asian-Americans, and what\u2019s interesting is that both narratives I\u2019ve just described traffic in versions of that trope. The older narrative portrays Asians as the hard-working, industrious natural conservatives who don\u2019t need handouts (in contrast with other immigrants, other minorities). The newer narrative casts them as the liberal coalition's noblest group \u2014 willing to put solidarity with fellow minorities above the economic concerns that might tempt them rightward, and willing to accept, for the greater good, a system of racial preferences that benefits others more than them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This idea informs a lot of liberal arguments about the Harvard lawsuit, which tend to portray conservative critics of affirmative action as tempters invading the multicultural Eden, and urge Asian-Americans to maintain their model-minority purity and resist the lure of mere meritocratic self-interest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But in addition to the whispering conservative serpent, the Harvard lawsuit\u2019s liberal critics increasingly have an Asian scapegoat too \u2014 specifically recent Chinese immigrants who hang out on WeChat, the popular social-media app, which a Vox writer complains has \u201cbecome an echo chamber for stories of anti-Asian discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For liberals these are the Bad Asians, putting their tribal resentments ahead of the racial-progressive cause. Which makes it striking that they are also the demographic being celebrated in \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d a movie that begins with a sequence in which Chinese-expat gossip spreads from New York to Singapore via, you guessed it, WeChat.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The only certain takeaway from this complexity is that the new liberal model-minority image, like the old conservative one, is likely to break down with increasing Asian numbers, influence, diversity and power.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Where strong Asian support for affirmative action endures in this new landscape, it will probably be as part of a more consciously ideological progressivism \u2014 one adopted by some second-generation Asian-Americans, as Reihan Salam suggested recently in The Atlantic, as a distinctive means of assimilation to the American cultural elite.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Where Asian support for racial progressivism breaks down, meanwhile, there are two possibilities. There could be a real swing back rightward among some Asian voters \u2014 a possibility that the Trump White House obviously entertains, but which can only happen if the Republican Party finds a way to lose its Trumpian aura of white identity politics and bigotry.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Perhaps more plausibly, Asian-Americans who reject affirmative action could begin to form their own centrist bloc within the Democratic Party, one that pulls the party back toward a kind of 1990s-style Clintonism, in the opposite direction from Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Or both things could happen, within different parts of the Asian-American community \u2014 with Chinese-Americans tilting more Republican and Indian-Americans staying firmly on the center-left.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But no matter what, this week\u2019s multiplex-courthouse convergence isn\u2019t an anomaly. It\u2019s a hint of both Asian-American influence and Asian-American divisions yet to come.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Ross Douthat</p>\n"}

So why not enact a federal statute that allows women to control their own bodies (rather than forcing them to carry and bear children against their will)? Even if the newly configured Supreme Court believes abortion is no longer a constitutional right, a national law would safeguard the right to choose.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Arguably, a law might be just as good, and in some ways better, than relying on the protection of the courts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Judicial fiat is not necessarily the best way to address divisive social issues. It is often better to settle grand disputes among citizens through the political process -- by having members of Congress debate, deliberate and vote, rather than having a group of unelected justices interpret often-obscure constitutional language.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Frankly, it has always been tough for laypeople to wrap their minds around the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe. The Constitution obviously doesn't mention abortion, nor does it mention the \"right to privacy\" that the justices used to justify the right to an abortion. Rather, the justices concluded that a right to privacy is implicit in the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, I'm fine with that logic, but it's not exactly straightforward. And that's part of the reason the decision has remained controversial for nearly 50 years. Even many abortion rights supporters -- including the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- voiced doubts about the way the Supreme Court decided the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So a national law protecting abortion rights makes sense. And after last week's oral arguments at the Supreme Court in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization showed how endangered Roe vs. Wade really is, Democrats amped up their support for one. On Sunday, for instance, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) argued on \"Meet the Press\" against allowing a \"patchwork\" of laws, many of them restricting or banning abortions, to be passed by state legislatures around the country.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The most sane route to get this done right now would be to bring this up before the U.S. Senate to codify Roe v. Wade into law,\" Klobuchar said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), for his part, has said he will allow a vote on the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill that would codify Roe and keep abortion legal nationwide, \"in the very near future.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But there's a problem. A big problem. Neither the Women's Health Protection Act nor any other bill guaranteeing access to abortion is likely to be enacted unless something dramatically changes in Washington.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The problem, of course -- as usual -- is the filibuster.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's not that Americans wouldn't approve of a law protecting abortion rights. According to the Pew Research Center, 59% of American voters believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases and only 39% believe it should be illegal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And it's not that the bill lacks support in Congress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The House, in fact, has already passed the Women's Health Protection Act, which is in some ways even stronger than Roe vs. Wade. (Among other things, it empowers the U.S. Department of Justice to enforce its provisions.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Senate could also probably pull together a majority in favor of a bill to codify Roe, after a couple of Democrats defect and a couple of Republicans come over (and if certain concerns by pro-choice Republicans are addressed).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But unfortunately, the Senate doesn't work by majority rule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The practical reality of the filibuster is that it takes the support of 60 senators for most bills to become law. That's the number of votes required -- three-fifths of the full Senate -- to end floor debate and proceed to an up-or-down vote.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And there's virtually no chance that the Women's Health Protection Act or any pro-choice variant will have that level of support.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, the Senate could theoretically do away with the filibuster -- or modify it in any of a number of ways. That would make many progressive Democrats very happy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"This is one more time when we see the filibuster blocking the will of the majority,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said on MSNBC last week. She noted that the Women's Health Protection Act \"is something we ought to be able to bring to the floor of the United States Senate and vote on it.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And while there are not enough votes at the moment to change the filibuster rules, that could change.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"If the court overturns Roe v. Wade, the floodgates will open and there'll be a different political calculus on the filibuster than there is right now,\" Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, told me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We'll see. Perhaps so. I'm skeptical. I'm also enough of a realist to know that the elimination or modification of the filibuster would be a mixed blessing for Democrats. It might help in the short term -- and could propel the Women's Health Protection Act to passage, which would be a very good thing. But Democrats will be harmed by it when their opponents are in power.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The fact is, Congress is polarized, paralyzed and generally dysfunctional for a host of reasons -- and that only increases the relative power of the newly confident, six-member majority of conservative justices on the Supreme Court. At the moment, they have little reason to moderate their stances or compromise or tone down right-wing positions on such issues as affirmative action, gun rights, labor and abortion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Congress can be a counterweight to an activist court, but only if it can function effectively and get the job done.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>@Nick_Goldberg</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: PHOTO: BARRIERS to separate abortion rights and antiabortion advocates stand outside the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTOGRAPHER:Andrew Harnik Associated Press</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1366758918.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>How to break the 'bamboo ceiling'; Ending affirmative action in college admissions won't level the field for Asian Americans.</h2<p>Any day now, the Supreme Court will announce its decision in the Fisher vs. University of Texas case, which could invalidate the use of race-conscious policies in college admissions. Some Asian American groups, such as the 80-20 Education Foundation, have been among the most vocal and visible in opposing what's broadly termed affirmative action. They believe getting rid of race considerations will work to the advantage of Asian Americans, who on average have held more extracurricular leadership positions and have higher test scores and grade-point averages than whites, yet have the lowest acceptance rate to elite private universities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They are not wrong to worry about Asian admissions. The circumstantial evidence for a \"bamboo\" ceiling on Asian admissions is mounting. According to a 2009 study by sociologists Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Radford, Asian Americans must score 140 points higher on the SAT to have the same chance at admission to private colleges as whites. College enrollment trends show that the percentage of Asian Americans in many Ivies has stayed flat -- between 15% and 18% -- in the last 20 years, even though the college-age population of Asian Americans has doubled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, affirmative action is a red herring for those who are truly concerned about discrimination against Asians in higher education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The great myth surrounding Fisher vs. University of Texas is that outlawing affirmative action would make college admissions meritocratic; that if race were ruled out of bounds, admissions would then be based solely on test scores and grades. It's just not that simple.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Universities' institutional interests often conflict with the meritocratic goal of admitting the most academically promising students. And that's not primarily because of race. Schools are seeking all kinds of talents and diversity in their incoming classes; they talk about looking at the \"whole person\" as they evaluate students, and how each \"admit\" will contribute to the community of freshmen. And part of what colleges are considering has to do with their reputation and financial bottom line.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Universities, especially the top tier, have always given affirmative action to children of alumni, children of wealthy donors, students from prep schools, athletes who can help the football team win, students who can pay full tuition and those with connections to political or cultural power. Those are the groups whose admission ensures that a school can pay its bills, raise faculty salaries, build more buildings, create more centers of study and so on.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, Daniel Golden's book, \"The Price of Admission,\" reveals that children of alumni are accepted at Harvard at a rate that is nearly quadruple that of other students, and that the children of wealthy donors get in with test scores and grades far below those of other admitted students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Such preferences are deeply ingrained in the system, though no one calls them affirmative action. They tend to reduce the chances of applicants from poor or immigrant families and even mainstream middle-class families. This means that admission to elite schools is more like gaining membership into an exclusive club than a meritocracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If Asians who are \"smart\" are being discriminated against, it's because they, like most Americans, don't also tend to fall emphatically enough into the categories \"wealthy, cultured and connected.\" There is no financial or institutional incentive to admit Asian Americans just because of their plentiful achievements; moreover, there is strong reason to believe that the \"club\" fears becoming \"too Asian.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To be sure, it's possible that banning race considerations would help some Asian Americans in their pursuit of selective schools. In theory, the seats that were occupied by students admitted primarily under race-conscious policies would be available to others, particularly high-achieving Asian Americans. But opponents seem to forget that affirmative action actually benefits Asian American groups, as it has all minorities, in creating more diversity overall. That's particularly true now in the case of groups such as Southeast Asians, who are underrepresented in higher education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The fundamental problem is not that blacks and Latinos are taking seats from Asian Americans. Real justice and equality at elite universities will not come by opposing affirmative action. There is a cost, in both political power and principle, to doing so. Asian Americans would be better off making common cause with other minorities who also face obstacles entering elite institutions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No matter what the court decides in Fisher, Asian Americans should demand that colleges make admissions policies and data much more open and transparent. The mystery surrounding college admissions serves nobody well. It makes parents and students frantic, and it breeds cynicism in the broader public about the role and value of higher education in general. But if colleges spoke more forthrightly about their admissions processes, they could enlist the public in a spirited, principled debate about who gets in -- one that would galvanize a system of higher education that is durable, fair and worthy of the American dream.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Carolyn Chen is an associate professor of sociology and director of the Asian American Studies Program at Northwestern University.

{"id": "txt/408572592.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>`Diversity': From Left to Far Left</h2<p>The central theme of the annual meeting of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS), which begins this week in Washington, is \"A Recommitment to Diversity.\" The only plenary panel consists of the head of Bill Clinton's civil rights division, a gay rights and disability rights activist, a former lawyer for the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund and a critical race theorist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All estimable people, and in a sense quite diverse, but in case you didn't get the point the program announces, \"In the last several years, an assault has been launched against diversity efforts. Court decisions . . . as well as statewide referenda . . . have limited affirmative action and diversity efforts. These actions go to the very heart of the diversity goals of the AALS.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course the term \"affirmative action\" means racial preferences, and \"diversity\" means diversity as defined by the racist census categories enshrined in much of our preferential and set-aside legislation and programs. As the roster of speakers and topic announcement make clear, diversity certainly does not mean -- though this is supposed to be a meeting of scholars and intellectuals -- diversity of ideas or points of view, unless your idea of diversity is the full gamut of opinions from left to far left.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The AALS approach is striking because meeting at the same time in the same city, the law teachers sections of the Federalist Society and the National Association of Scholars -- both routinely dismissed as \"right-wing\" and \"conservative\" -- have mounted discussions of related topics that are genuinely and studiedly diverse in the only sense relevant to academic discourse: diverse in the points of view presented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But these groups are prohibited from meeting in the same hotel as the AALS or publicizing their panels in its literature (as is the Christian Law Society). On the other hand the avowedly leftist Society of American Law Teachers is welcomed to the party with full courtesies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I believe that the subject of race is as difficult as any facing our nation, but it has many sides. As Ronald Reagan's solicitor general, I called for several of the Supreme Court decisions that doubtless will be denounced at this week's pep rally, but I also have written that racial preferences in many of our institutions of higher learning in the first generation after Brown v. Board of Education were justified and that their rapid elimination now would be disastrous if it led to a resegregation of the elite institutions of the nation. I was criticized by both sides for saying so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The debate is lively out there. William Bowen and Derek Bok have written a thoughtful book calling for the continuation of preferences and pointing to data showing the good that preferences have done. Critics have taken issue with their data and their conclusions. Lani Guinier has written to celebrate Texas's \"10 percent solution\" and the way in which it promises genuine diversity without recourse to the government's ruling by race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Adding to the complexities is the fact that the numbers of groups with a plausible claim to preference are growing so large that an affirmative action program soon could become a universal partition of the nation along ethnic lines. Meanwhile increasing rates of intermarriage are making the definition of who belongs to what group more arbitrary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course university administrators, like political leaders, must choose a policy, implement and defend it. But instead of treating these issues as topics for genuine inquiry and public discussion, the AALS reacts as if it were rallying the German professoriate to resist Hitler's \"assault\" -- to use its own word -- on the academy. Except here the assault is by democratically appointed judges and justices and by the voters in California and Washington.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just as the one-sided nature of the legal academy in the '70s and '80s had little influence on the development of the law and the trends in the courts, so also this rally organized by the American Association of Law Schools may be doomed to a similar irrelevance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Intellectuals have influence only if they have fresh ideas to respond to fresh realities, and the fortress mentality reflected in this pathetic performance of the AALS cannot possibly produce anything new. Those who highhandedly would design a program such as this and propose it as a serious academic exercise hope somehow to exert influence. Instead they discredit themselves and condemn their voices to irrelevance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The writer, solicitor general in the Reagan administration, is a professor at Harvard Law School.</p>\n"}

There\u2019s a Trump party. The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No sir, the Republican Party as you knew it \u2014 and I knew it \u2014 is in a Trump-induced coma. As Trump dragged down your party, Republican voters cheered, and your so-called leaders have cowered.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Congressmen have shielded and protected him, excused and accepted him. The party as a whole \u2014 or at least the vast majority of it \u2014 has turned its back on much of what it once held dear, and heretofore adhered to: a common sense of morality, ethics and norms or propriety.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To be clear, much of what Trump has surfaced among Republicans has always been there \u2014 sexism, racism, xenophobia, anti-immigrant hysteria \u2014 but Trump has elevated it, venerated it, and branded it. This is the Trumpublican Party, a party reborn in Trump\u2019s own image, one existing to worship him with blind allegiance and follow him with mindless obeisance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For instance, Trump has a long history of womanizing. Republicans shrugged. He bragged on tape about assaulting women. Republicans shrugged. He has now been exposed as having paid a porn star for her silence about an alleged affair, and Republicans have shrugged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most of these people, in their misogyny and patriarchy (including the majority of white women voters in America who voted for Trump in 2016) \u2014 don\u2019t see a problem with the way Trump treats women. An April Quinnipiac University poll found that two-thirds of Republicans believe that \u201cTrump treats women with the same amount of respect as he treats men.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Furthermore, a YouGov poll from the end of April found that while a majority of Trump voters believe that a woman would probably be elected president during their lifetimes, a majority hoped it wouldn\u2019t happen. Trump has attacked people who are black (protesting athletes, immigrants from African countries, President Obama) and brown (Mexicans, Muslims, immigrants coming north) and the Trumpublicans have cheered.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Trump has defended Nazis and has been slow and tentative about criticizing racists. He has invited flaming racist Ted Nugent to the White House. Nugent has called President Obama a piece of human excrement , referred to Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton\u2019s speech in a column as \u201c lisping their ebonic mumbo-jumbo ,\u201d and wrote in another column , \u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder if it would have been best had the South won the Civil War.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Trump has pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who ordered the systematic racial profiling of Latino communities. As the A.C.L.U. put it : \u201cIn traffic stops, workplace raids and neighborhood sweeps, Arpaio ordered deputies to target residents solely based on their ethnicity, often detaining people without reasonable suspicion that they were violating any laws that his office was allowed to enforce.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And last week Trump pardoned racist Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who as Slate put it , \u201chas trafficked in racism and homophobia for nearly 30 years, stretching back to his time at Dartmouth in the early years of the Reagan administration, where he edited the right-wing Dartmouth Review. Among other things, he ran an anti-affirmative action article written in a caricature of black vernacular English (titled \u201cDis Sho Ain\u2019t No Jive, Bro\u201d)\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And yet, the same April Quinnipiac poll found that an overwhelming 82 percent of Republicans believe Trump treats people of color with the same amount of respect as he treats white people.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These people were already detached from reality, but Trump helped them to see a new reality, one in which their hatred and bigotry were not abhorrent, but rather markers of the mainstream. They didn\u2019t have a problem, the rest of America was the problem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is only in that alternate reality, in that other world, that Gallup could report poll results last week that found that three-quarters of Republicans believe that Trump provides strong moral leadership as president.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These are the same Republicans who told Gallup last month that they thought that the ethical standards of the thoroughly unethical Trump administration officials were excellent or good (71 percent) as opposed to not good or poor (27 percent).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I will not say that the pre-Trump Republican Party is dead, because anything can happen in politics, but I will most definitely say that it is grievously ill, on life support and Trump is standing over the motionless body with the power cord in his hand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For conquering and crippling the Republican Party, Trump will be long remembered, but probably not in the way his supporters hope.

{"id": "txt/421966465.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Commentary; A Misguided Challenge to Affirmative Action; Sander is wrong: It helps blacks in law school.</h2<p>Eighteen months ago, the Supreme Court found that affirmative action in law schools helps cultivate diverse leaders for a diverse society. Now, a new study by UCLA law professor and economist Richard H. Sander claims that the court was wrong on the facts. He argues that American law schools would produce more black lawyers by eliminating affirmative action than by preserving it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sander's counterintuitive thesis turns on the notion that affirmative action, by lowering admission standards, produces a \"mismatch\" between black students and their white peers. The mismatch, he argues, causes blacks to earn lower grades, drop out at higher rates and pass the bar at lower rates than they would if they went to less selective schools. He predicts that although there would be fewer black law students without affirmative action, their higher grades and lower dropout rates would boost the total number of blacks who pass the bar by 7%.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Is he right? Can we have our colorblind cake and eat it too? Probably not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First, Sander's conclusion flies in the face of the most basic tenet of economics: that people act rationally to maximize their self-interest. Affirmative action has been with us for 30 years. Is it really possible that cohort after cohort of talented black students, lured by the siren of affirmative action, has incurred large debts and forgone other opportunities in order to attend top law schools -- all on a misguided expectation of success?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If the costs of affirmative action outweigh the benefits, then surely the \"victims\" would know. Over time, they would see that the best black students at second-tier law schools (and some top students do go to second-tier schools for geographic, financial and other reasons) far outperform their peers at more elite schools and have a much easier time passing the bar. That hard truth would be passed from one generation to the next.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But Sander offers no evidence that this occurs. The fact is that thousands of black students admitted through affirmative action have succeeded by working hard and aiming high. The idea that they should lower their sights deserves strong skepticism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second, Sander takes an unrealistic view of how many blacks would still attend law school if affirmative action were to disappear. He believes that students now in first-tier schools would go to second- tier schools, that students in second-tier schools would go to third- tier schools, and so on. This, he says, would reduce the number of black law students, but not the number of black lawyers, once better grades and retention were factored in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is almost certainly wrong. The smooth cascade Sander envisions is unlikely. As his study concedes, ending affirmative action would cause black enrollment at the most elite law schools to drop from 7% or 8% to 1% or 2%. A top student faced with being one of only a handful of blacks in law school might reasonably decide that other career paths are less isolating and more promising. Similarly, other options might appear more attractive to an applicant who, without affirmative action, would have to attend a 40th-ranked school instead of a 15th-ranked school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, there's reason to doubt Sander's claim that ending affirmative action would eliminate \"mismatch\" and, with it, racial gaps in law school grades, retention and bar passage. Copious research, which Sander does not confront, shows that the achievement gap at selective universities is because of differences not only in entering credentials but also in the university experience itself. This was confirmed in a recent study by College of New Jersey sociologist Timothy Clydesdale using Sander's core data set.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stanford psychologist Claude Steele has shown that the fear of doing badly in school and thereby confirming racial stereotypes generates anxiety among black students that undermines academic performance. In addition, for many minority students, the lack of minority faculty heightens feelings of isolation and makes it difficult to find close mentors. And despite much progress, minority students still face discrimination on campus, both subtle and overt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given these factors, it is folly to believe that eliminating affirmative action would eliminate the achievement gap. What's worse, it distracts us from seeking to improve the climate and quality of the educational experience in ways that enable all students to do their best.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Goodwin Liu is an assistant professor of law at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall.</p>\n"}

{"id": "txt/1969596934.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>A deep student-loan hole for blacks</h2<p>As high school seniors head into the holiday season -- also known less festively as college application time -- they need to devote as much effort to calculating the debt they'll take on as they do perfecting their admission essays. The data show that a lot of kids don't know what they are getting into when they take out a student loan. And for certain groups of kids the problem is a lot worse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to two analyses based on numbers released from the Department of Education last month, almost half of all black students who took out federal student loans defaulted within 12 years. Robert Kelchen, a professor of higher education at Seton Hall University, conducted one of the studies. He found the default rate of black students (49%) was more than twice that of white students (20%) and more than four times the rate of Asian students (11%). This disparity held true for nonprofit and for-profit colleges and universities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among students who ultimately dropped out of college, 65% of black students defaulted compared with 38% of white students. And among those who earned degrees there was also a disparity, with 23% of black students defaulting compared with 6% of white students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kelchen doesn't speculate as to the cause of these disparities, but the authors of a second report from the Center for American Progress do. \"Seeing even African American students who earned a bachelor's degree struggle [to pay back loans] reinforces that we cannot pretend the federal student loan program exists in a vacuum,\" wrote Ben Miller, the senior director for postsecondary education at the center and a former Education Department official during the Obama administration. \"The median African American household has just $1,700 in accumulated wealth. Racial discrimination in hiring has not improved over the past quarter-century.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Michael Lomax, who is the president of the United Negro College Fund, tweeted: \"We must improve federal financial aid policies to help low-income  AA students earn degrees with less debt  repay loans w/less red tape.\" In the past, he has encouraged colleges to try to hold their costs down, but mostly he has advocated for the federal government to simply give grants rather than loans to more students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now Lomax is suggesting that there should be fewer restrictions -- less red tape -- on how much debt students can take on. But the evidence of default would indicate that this is exactly the wrong approach. Rather than making it easier to get loans, students have to be impressed with the risks they are taking when they sign up to borrow money.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Instead of weighing the costs and benefits of higher ed, students appear to be caught up in a mad rush to enroll at any price. High schools, colleges and society in general relentlessly push students toward an associate's or bachelor's degree program. But given the racial achievement gap in high school, it would be surprising if black students were prepared for college at the same rate as white students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to a 2016 study from Eric Hanushek of Stanford University, the average 12th-grade black student placed in the 19th percentile for math achievement. In reading, the average black student scored in the 22nd percentile. This is barely an improvement from the numbers from 50 years earlier.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet, black college enrollment has grown significantly, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. From 1994 to 2013, it rose from 11% to 16% at schools that primarily grant associate's degrees, such as community colleges, and from 11% to 14% at colleges and universities that offer bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. In 20 years, blacks grew from being underrepresented to overrepresented in college, all while their readiness for college barely budged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If we presume that everyone who takes out a student loan has similar intentions with regard to its repayment, then the default rate represents the gap between people's confidence that they will earn enough money make the payments and their actual ability to do so. We seem to be assuring black students in this regard and ignoring the data.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It doesn't help that black students tend to get degrees in less well-paying fields. The recent default-rate analyses don't break down their findings by major. But a 2016 study from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce found that black students are less likely to pursue lucrative majors than their white peers. Blacks account for 8% of general engineering majors, 7% of mathematics majors, and only 5% of computer engineering majors, the study said, while. in lower-paying fields like human services and community organization (20%) and social work (19%), they are overrepresented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Colleges that are eager to boost their student bodies' racial diversity will often admit students who are less qualified -- this is the \"mismatch problem\" that scholars like UCLA's Richard Sander have documented -- and then steer them into easier and lower-paying fields in order to boost graduation rates. In other words, it is not racial discrimination but affirmative action policies that may be to blame for this sad state of affairs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As Miller notes: \"Sending African American students into an inequitable adulthood with large debts from college can put them even further behind.\" The answer is not letting students borrow more money or lowering interest rates or forgiving debt. It's being honest with them about what kind of higher education they are prepared for, which degrees earn the most money and what a college education is really worth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTOGRAPHER:Varijanta Getty Images/iStockphoto</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Naomi Schaefer Riley is a senior fellow at the Independent Women's Forum.</p>\n"}

That left 22% undecided.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Some explaining needs to be done if the proponents have any hopes of seeing this passed in November,\" says Mark Baldassare, the institute president. But Gail Heriot, a law professor at the University of San Diego who sits on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and co-chairs the No on 16 campaign, isn't so sure: \"The plainer the issue is made to California voters, the more they will oppose it.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Maybe that's why Team Yes has opted to obscure what Proposition 16 really does. Start with the initiative itself. Here's the language in the constitution it would repeal: \"The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In choosing a title for the measure, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra could have made it clear that Proposition 16 would cut this provision from the constitution. Instead, the official title is deliberately vague: \"Allows Diversity as a Factor in Public Employment, Education and Contracting Decisions.\" As if banning racial discrimination somehow forbids diversity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So what explains the people's resistance? Certainly much of it comes from California's Asian-American community, some of whom have become politically active for the first time. But Asian-Americans account for only 15% or so of the state's population. The Public Policy Institute of California poll suggests many non-Asians also have strong doubts about returning to race preferences in state decisions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As dubious as Proposition 16 is on its face, it is especially noxious in California given the state's history of anti-Asian bias. In the late 19th century the Golden State was an early champion of the Chinese Exclusion Act and passed other discriminatory legislation targeting Chinese workers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At this time California was also home to the Workingmen's Party, a labor organization whose leader was famous for his slogan \"The Chinese must go.\" And only this year did the California Assembly pass a resolution apologizing for its discrimination against Japanese-Americans during World War II.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Affirmative action, promoted in the name of diversity, is nowhere near as intentionally malicious as any of these historical anti-Asian efforts. But its effects are nasty and unfair. Just ask the family of the Chinese-American high-school grad who doesn't get into a top university, for which she is more than qualified, because of her skin color. What could be a clearer example of \"systemic racism\"?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the lack of tolerance for Asian-Americans asserting themselves, moreover, today's progressives can be as indelicate as any 19th-century pol. According to Politico, after a newly awakened Asian-American community rallied in 2014 to beat back an earlier effort to repeal the constitution's prohibition against racial preferences, California Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia told her Democratic caucus, \"This makes me feel like I want to punch the next Asian person I see in the face.\" Ms. Garcia, re-elected since her comments surfaced in 2018, is today a proud \"yes\" vote.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So what's the strategy going forward? A fundraising email from Yes on 16 acknowledged dispiriting poll results but said that \"support surges\" once Californians learn that Proposition 16 is supported by Ms. Harris and Mr. Newsom while \"opposed by Donald Trump and white supremacists.\" Never mind that Mr. Trump has nothing to do with Proposition 16 and hasn't said a word about it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even so, given the president's deep unpopularity in California and that 1 in 5 voters remain undecided, such a campaign may work. But it requires California voters to buy the new progressive argument that Asian-Americans fighting for equal treatment are in fact agents of white supremacy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Write to mcgurn@wsj.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: End of Race Preferences Led To More Minority Graduates\" -- WSJ Sept. 28, 2020)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By William McGurn</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2699286141.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>History for the cherry-picking in Harvard case</h2<p>If you thought the Supreme Court term that just concluded was a disaster, brace yourself for the next one. The conservative justices will shift their focus to another long-standing goal: outlawing affirmative action in higher education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The outcome in two cases before the court, challenging admissions programs at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, appears even more assured than was the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The conservative justices, who have long bristled at anything that smacks of a racial preference, seem poised to overturn decades of precedent letting colleges and universities consider racial diversity as a factor when admitting students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But a spate of briefs defending Harvard and UNC offer compelling arguments that should give the conservative majority pause. In their recent rulings expanding gun rights and eliminating constitutional protection for abortion, the justices emphasized the importance of history - looking to the laws and practices in place at the time the relevant constitutional provision was enacted to determine its original meaning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions,\" Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe. \"Only if a firearm regulation is consistent with this Nation's historical tradition\" can it be justified under the Second Amendment, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in striking down a New York state law limiting concealed carry permits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If the conservative majority meant what it said in those cases, the newly filed briefs suggest, they will vote to uphold the programs now in place, not strike them down.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Don't hold your breath, I know.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The legal landscape is clear, if contested. Since the court's splintered 1978 ruling in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, colleges and universities have been permitted to take race into account as one factor in admissions to ensure a diverse student body. In 2003, the court, dividing 5-4, reaffirmed that basic rule against a claim that it violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection of the laws. Now, the justices are being asked to overrule that case, Grutter v. Bollinger, and given the transformation of the court in the intervening years, that outcome seems guaranteed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, what does history have to tell the justices? The briefs make a powerful case that the shorthand view of the 14th Amendment as strictly \"colorblind\" ignores the context of the time in which it was written - in the aftermath of the Civil War - and the willingness of its authors to approve \"race-conscious remedies\" for discrimination that are anathema to the current conservative majority.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Absolute neutrality\" when it comes to race \"has never been a universal constitutional principle, either at the time of ratification or in the Court's jurisprudence,\" Harvard argues in its brief filed last month. \"The Congress that adopted the Fourteenth Amendment ... authorized numerous measures that benefited African Americans in the aftermath of the Civil War. Against that backdrop, this Court's far narrower holdings permitting consideration of race as one factor in an individualized decision are readily permissible.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One such measure was the Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1866, which provided help for African Americans in everything from education to land distribution. When President Andrew Johnson vetoed the law creating the Freedmen's Bureau, arguing that it helped \"one class or color of our people more than another,\" Congress overrode his veto.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The next year, Congress appropriated funds for \"destitute colored people\" in the District of Columbia, \"rebuffing objections to the measure as 'class legislation' 'applicable to colored people and not ... to the white people,'\" writes Harvard's lawyer, Seth P. Waxman, a solicitor general under Bill Clinton.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An amicus brief filed on behalf of historians and law professors amplifies this view. \"The Reconstruction Framers recognized that there exists an important distinction between, on the one hand, racial designations that denigrate and harm, and, on the other hand, race-conscious laws that ameliorate discrimination and advance equality of opportunity,\" the brief argues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Constitutional Accountability Center, which advocates for a progressive interpretation of the Constitution's original meaning, put it in even starker terms. \"The Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment were the originators of affirmative action,\" its brief contends. \"Far from establishing an absolute constitutional ban on the use of race by the government, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment rejected proposals to prohibit any and all use of racial classifications by the government.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What do those challenging the Harvard and UNC programs say in response? Tellingly, the brief by the group that brought the lawsuits, Students for Fair Admissions, makes almost no reference to history. An amicus brief for Edwin Meese III, attorney general under Ronald Reagan, asserts that the Freedmen's Bureau example isn't relevant because the 14th Amendment limited state, not federal, power, and because the \"triggering characteristic\" wasn't skin color but having been enslaved. The history professors' brief dismisses this account as \"incorrect\" and \"ahistorical.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Which brings us back to competing accounts of history, and the conservative justices' demonstrated willingness to cherry-pick the version most helpful to their cause. Sorry to say, it's hard to imagine them letting history get in the way of the result they desire.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/420206139.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Our great racial divide ; From O.J. to Reagan, race looms large</h2<p>It is painfully ironic to me that the death of President Ronald Reagan came so near to the 10th anniversary of the O.J. Simpson murder case. Both tragedies polarized Americans along lines of race, but also demonstrated how much the races still need to learn from each other.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There were not a lot of black faces among the crowds who paid tribute to the nation's 40th president, certainly not when compared to the multihued masses that turned out for the funerals of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And 10 years after the June 12, 1994, deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, a recent NBC News poll found that today 87 percent of whites and only 29 percent of blacks think O.J. Simpson is guilty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Both tragedies dramatized how differently most black and white Americans still view the world, with Latino, Asian, American and other non-white opinions gravitating toward one pole or the other, depending on the issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Simpson's \"not guilty\" verdict produced shockingly different reactions between the races--cheering blacks and shocked whites-- that were caught by television cameras. Suddenly whites and blacks who had been working and socializing in seeming harmony were made aware of the continuing gulf between them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For the record, I thought Simpson probably was guilty but that the prosecution had not fully proved its case. But nuanced views like that did not get much attention in the media at the time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The worst consequence of that ugly episode, in my African- American view, was its cost to black innocence. Just as Harper Lee's \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" classic wins great sympathy for the historical victimization of innocent blacks by all-white juries, the Simpson trial transmitted to many minds an image of a guilty-but- rich black celebrity freed by a nearly all-black jury and a black lawyer who \"played the race card.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some of my black friends, by contrast, told me that they cheered because they were relieved to find a rather perverse form of racial progress in the controversial verdict, that after years of believing that not even money and celebrity status could buy the kind of justice that rich white men usually get, Simpson showed them that it can be bought by wealthy blacks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A similar racial divide followed Reagan's death. There was no cheering, to the best of my knowledge, in black barbershops or beauty salons, but there also was not a lot of weeping. Many believed that Reagan played the race card himself when he announced his 1980 presidential candidacy in Philadelphia, Miss., where three civil rights workers were slain 40 years ago. Many believed his attacks against \"welfare queens,\" social programs and affirmative action were code words for a halt to black progress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although I used a lot of ink criticizing Reagan in the 1980s, I take a more charitable view of his motives. At best, I think his image adviser, Michael Deaver, was right when he said Reagan was \"naive\" about race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I could hear that in Reagan's voice when he said during the 1980 GOP convention that his party respected people as \"individuals, not groups.\" As with other issues, Reagan seemed to see only warm, engaging anecdotes, not cold, hard statistics. Black folks, by contrast, have always been discriminated against as a group and made most of their progress as a group. Reagan's view called on blacks to give up an important resource, their community bonds, for no immediate reward.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet it is part of Reagan's legacy that he made the world safe for black conservatives like U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and others who follow the tradition of Booker T. Washington, the pre- eminent black conservative of the early 20th Century.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Washington believed that conservative values like education, hard work and self-reliance could work for blacks as well as anyone else, despite the pain of lynchings, segregation, voter disenfranchisement and other abuses. His views were far more popular with whites than blacks, who gravitated to W.E.B. DuBois and the emerging civil rights movement of the NAACP. Some things have not changed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet today we also hear seemingly conservative values echoing in unusual places, like Bill Cosby's recent bracing and controversial comments about the need for low-income blacks to work harder to help themselves, even as upper-income blacks, like Cosby, try to help them. While many blacks criticized him for sounding like a snob, many others, like me, applaud his candor. Cosby was only expressing in public the frustrations many blacks feel in private about the limits of the traditional liberal agenda.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope his candor will lead to a new dialogue among blacks about which liberation strategies will work best in this new century. If it does lead to a new dialogue, history may show this to be another unexpected legacy of the Reagan years: He made conservative values safe for blacks to express in public again.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>E-mail: cptime@aol.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Roman Genn.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/432295114.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Joe Millionaire for President</h2<p>E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Watching that noble doctor Bill Frist make his TV rounds last weekend -- I know he's a saint because he keeps telling us so -- I began to think I was going under general anesthesia. Here's a guy who dispenses bromides and palliatives for every troublesome topic, dishing out the spin so smoothly that you have to question your own grasp on reality. A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down? Dr. Frist, as he insists that we call him, gives us the whole bowl. ''He's perfected that earnest, focused look that people want when they go to the doctor,'' one of his former medical colleagues told me this week. ''It's as if you are the only person in the world.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's a sham, of course, because the client who always comes first is Senator Frist's role model and patron in compassionate conservatism, George W. Bush. And so the good doctor congratulates himself for his good work on ''H.I.V./AIDS in Africa,'' an admirable record indeed were it not for the unmentioned footnote that he knocked down his own Senate legislation earmarking $500 million for that cause by 60 percent after the White House jerked his chain. He promises to open up Medicare to private health plans without mentioning that much of his own fortune (in a blind trust, of course) derived from the for-profit Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), the medical giant founded by his father and brother.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dr. Frist further suggests that that little Trent Lott nastiness is behind us now because Republicans are going to have ''a dialogue on race . . . in a more visible, a more open way.'' The dialogue, we later learn, consists of (1) highly visible photo ops for Dr. Frist with black conservatives; (2) a spirited defense of the judicial nominee Charles Pickering's strenuous effort to reduce the sentence of a convicted cross-burning hoodlum; and (3) the White House intervention in the Supreme Court case challenging the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. (Will the administration also weigh in on the affirmative action programs for alumni children that have given every Bush family applicant a leg up at Yale?)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The doctor is very good at this game, but not yet nearly so sophisticated as the master. The White House has the bait-and-switch routine down to a science. As The Associated Press reported on Wednesday, Ari Fleischer just happened to announce that Mr. Bush would increase aid to Africa just before declaring the president's intention to intervene in the Michigan case -- much as he had announced at the height of the Lott embarrassment that the president was looking forward to a trip to Africa. (That safari was quietly ''rescheduled'' to no fixed date when Mr. Lott stepped down three days later.) The Africa card is the Republicans' answer to the Democrats' race card, and once it had been played, the stage was set for Mr. Bush's ''statement on affirmative action.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That statement contained so many sound bites lauding ''diversity'' -- the word turned up as many as three times in a single breath -- that the casual channel surfer might think the president was joining the Rainbow Coalition. Or forget that he presides over a party whose Congressional majority contains not a single black member, even in the House, where ''diversity'' could easily have been put into action, affirmative or otherwise, by recruiting a minority candidate for one of the many safe Republican districts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Bush rhetorical technique -- of implying one thing while doing quite another -- was first honed to perfection in the speech handing down the great stem-cell ''compromise'' of summer 2001. In his new and mostly worshipful memoir about Mr. Bush, ''The Right Man,'' his former speechwriter David Frum describes the president's sleight-of-hand technique from the inside: ''Because Bush summarized all points of view so sympathetically, he was able to win the support of his viewers for his own not at all middle-of-the-road position.'' What the speech did, in other words, was persuade inattentive listeners that the president was so sympathetic to scientific research and the ill that he couldn't possibly be throwing roadblocks in the way of potential cures for cancer, juvenile diabetes and Alzheimer's (as in fact he was).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was only a few weeks after the stem-cell speech that 9/11 was upon us. Although that cataclysmic event is said to have changed George W. Bush as much as it supposedly changed so much else, it has not altered his brazen style. If anything, the midterm election has emboldened the White House to use fictional rhetoric to paper over harsher reality in almost every policy area it can.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Bush rolls out an economic plan that he says will help address joblessness, now at an eight-year high and growing, when in fact it's mainly a payday for those who collect dividend checks. Promising to speed the cleanup of corporate corruption, he accepts the resignation of Harvey Pitt, but two months-plus later Mr. Pitt is still on the job, working his will as the S.E.C. does some of its most crucial ''reform'' rule-making. Mr. Bush thumps as a hallmark of his education vision the No Child Left Behind Act, but his tight budget will leave states struggling to fulfill its alleged goals. Even Marvin Olasky, the Bush sycophant who wrote the book that inspired compassionate conservatism, said last month that while he awards the president an ''A'' for ''setting the message'' he gives him an ''F'' for his legislative follow-through.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But Mr. Olasky may not be the only one who is waking up to the ruse. The drop in Mr. Bush's poll numbers this week reminds us that anesthesia, no matter how well administered, eventually wears off. Affirmative action, judicial nominations, Enron and the rest are passionate issues for some, but war is a wake-up call for all. As the president keeps stamping his foot about Saddam Hussein, there is a dawning sensation that America is being held hostage by the administration idee fixe that is Iraq. It's a sword of Damocles hanging over our foreign policy, economy and national security alike.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The White House wants us to believe, as Dr. Frist reassured us last weekend, that North Korea is ''an entirely, entirely different situation'' from Iraq. Yes it is, not least because North Korea does not produce oil. But the two situations are now inseparable. Kim Jong Il may be crazy but he's not stupid. He bet the bank that Mr. Bush, for all his promises not to respond to nuclear blackmail, would do exactly that to avoid a distraction from Iraq. And so he called the president's bluff and will soon get his ransom. Mr. Bush's retreat all but invites other rogues to push us around, or worse, in this interregnum of vulnerability that his verbal bluster and tactical blundering has created.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Iraq's hammerlock on the economy is just as tight. We increasingly realize that no matter what Mr. Bush's tax-cutting plan, or any Democratic alternative, the economic issue du jour is not so much class warfare as warfare, period. No one believes the economy is going to expand as long as war clouds dampen the business environment. If the war drags on for months, recession could well follow.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nor does anyone know what vanquishing Saddam and then governing Iraq will cost in either dollars or lives. Lawrence Lindsey, the chief White House economic adviser, was fired after he put the bill at $100 billion to $200 billion. But William Nordhaus, the Yale economist, puts the Lindsey estimate at the low end, with the high end being $1.6 trillion over a decade. Whatever the number, the cost of the war isn't being factored at all into the budget proposal the White House will send to Congress, according to USA Today. Yet even with that huge sum unaccounted for, the tax cuts and deficits are already so out of control that budgetary allotments for homeland security are being cut back. As for the American troops to be thrown at Saddam, remember those leaked Pentagon war plans from last summer that capped the total at 250,000? This week ABC's John McWethy reported that the number had escalated to 350,000 before the battle is even joined.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Bush's rhetoric says we can have it all -- lower taxes, better schools, a war or two or three, civil defense -- without pain. But the numbers don't add up, and when the expanded war becomes a reality, we'll see a bottom line that not even the smoothest politician's bedside manner can obscure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While we wait, an anxious nation whiles away the time with ''Joe Millionaire,'' a ''reality'' TV show in which a sweet-talking con man charms a bevy of credulous women into believing he will give them a fairy-tale ending. And why not? It's a perfect reflection of the reality of this moment, right down to its predictable, all too inevitable, denouement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Drawing</p>\n"}

An initial perusal of thousands of pages of documents from her years in the Clinton White House show her to be an adept centrist -- much like her old boss -- who tried to remain thoughtful while shielding President Bill Clinton from ideological extremes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is hard to find anything in the 90,000-odd pages of papers released so far that shows whether Ms. Kagan will be an effective restraint on the Roberts Court's aggressive march to the right. She was, after all, a mid- to senior-level bureaucrat in the 1990s, working for a White House that could twist itself into knots trying to find the midpoint on every issue. Her job often required her to become a contortionist, searching for principled positions that would not inflame a newly Republican Congress or a generally conservative Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a 1997 memo on an affirmative action case, written when she was a presidential assistant for domestic policy, she could have backed a New Jersey school district that cited diversity in dismissing a white teacher instead of an equally qualified black one. Some in the administration wanted to do just that. But she sided with Walter Dellinger, then the solicitor general, who said the administration should back the white teacher to prevent the case from going to the Supreme Court, which could have used it to strike down a series of affirmative action programs. \"I think this is exactly the right position -- as a legal matter, as a policy matter, and as a political matter,\" Ms. Kagan wrote.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>She supported reducing the disparity between lighter criminal sentences for dealing cocaine powder and heavier ones for crack cocaine, a difference generally seen as favoring white defendants over black ones. The Congressional Black Caucus wanted to eliminate the disparity entirely, but Ms. Kagan and her supervisor, Bruce Reed, the domestic policy director, said that approach would never work with Congressional Republicans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some of the positions she took involved unfortunate concessions. When a California landlady refused to rent to unmarried couples for religious reasons, Ms. Kagan objected to a State Supreme Court decision that said the woman had violated antidiscrimination laws. She also dismissed New York City's objections to a provision in the welfare reform law that allowed city employees to turn in illegal immigrants, which violated a longstanding and exemplary city policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If nothing else, the papers should mute the Republican outcries that Ms. Kagan is a dangerous leftist, since they show she is nothing of the kind. But she will have to become much more than a conciliator to fill the shoes of the retiring Justice John Paul Stevens, in many ways the conscience of the current court. We hope that other documents to emerge in the weeks to come, and her confirmation hearings starting this month, will help fill in the many blanks about the nature of a future Justice Kagan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/433305924.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>On Campus, a Good Man Is Hard to Find</h2<p>When a boy opens his acceptance letter from college, he now has to wonder what most impressed the admissions officers. Did they want him for his mind, or just his body?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The admissions director at Kenyon College, Jennifer Delahunty Britz, published an Op-Ed article this week revealing an awkward truth about her job: affirmative action for boys. As the share of the boys in the applicant pool keeps shrinking -- it will soon be down to 40 percent nationally -- colleges are admitting less-qualified boys in order to keep the gender ratio balanced on campus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This week's revelation did not please Kim Gandy, the president of the National Organization for Women, who told me that she might challenge the legality of affirmative action for male applicants. She and I are not normally ideological soulmates, but I have some sympathy with her on this policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's not fair to the girls who are rejected despite having higher grades and test scores than the boys who get fat envelopes. It's not fair to the boys, either, if they're not ready to keep up with their classmates. Affirmative action just makes them prone to fail, and is probably one of the reasons that men are more likely than women to drop out of college.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After consulting with the federal Education Department, I can confidently report that this discrimination may violate the law -- or then again, it may not. Either way, I agree with Gandy that public colleges shouldn't practice it, because the government shouldn't favor one group over another.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gandy's also wary of allowing private schools like Kenyon to discriminate, and she's skeptical of their justification: that they need a fairly even male-female ratio on campus to attract the best applicants of either sex. I'm not sure if that's true, but I trust the colleges to know better than me or Gandy or federal lawyers. As long as a school is private, let it favor whomever it wants -- men, women, alumni children, Latinos, African-Americans -- without any interference from the Education Department.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What the department should be doing is figuring out how to help boys reach college. The gender gap has been getting worse for two decades, but the Education Department still isn't focusing on it. Instead, it has an ''educational equity'' program aimed at helping girls and women.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The department is paying to encourage African and Slavic girls and women in Oregon to pursue careers in science. There's a grant to help women in West Virginia overcome ''traditional, outdated 19th-century attitudes'' by pursuing jobs in blue-collar trades. Another grant aims to motivate women at the Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn to study math.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those are all noble goals. I'd be glad to see the women in Brooklyn take up advanced calculus. But the chief ''equity'' issue at their college is the shortage of men, who make up barely a fifth of the student body. What happened to the boys who didn't make it?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Boys are, on average, as smart as girls, but they are much less fond of school. They consistently receive lower grades, have more discipline problems and are more likely to be held back for a year or placed in special education classes. The Harvard economist Brian Jacob attributes these problems to boys' lack of ''noncognitive skills,'' like their difficulties with paying attention in class, their disorganization and their reluctance to seek help from others.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those are serious handicaps, but they could be mitigated if schools became more boy-friendly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A few educators have suggested reforms: more games and competitions that appeal to boys, more outdoor exercise, more male teachers, more experiments with single-sex schools. But those ideas have gotten little attention or money. Schools have been too busy trying to close the gender gap in the few areas where boys are ahead, like sports and science.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No matter what changes are made to help boys, they'll probably still be less likely than girls to go on to college, simply because girls' skills and interests are better suited to the types of white-collar jobs that now require college degrees. Boys will remain more inclined to skip college in favor of relatively high-paying jobs in fields like construction and manufacturing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's no reason to expect a 50-50 ratio on campus -- and certainly no reason to mandate it. Boys don't need that kind of affirmative action. What they could use, long before college, is equal attention.</p>\n"}

The initiative also states that \"nothing in this section prohibits the state from remedying discrimination against, or underrepresentation of, disadvantaged groups as documented in a valid disparity study or proven in a court of law.\" This opens the door to other groups petitioning for special treatment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Initiative 1000 claims it restores \"affirmative action into state law without the use of quotas or preferential treatment.\" Former state Rep. Jesse Wineberry, who helped draft the text, says the initiative requires that \"every person who receives an opportunity must first and foremost be qualified.\" Race, gender or other forms of identity are supposed to be considered only after candidates pass that hurdle.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Other proponents are more candid about what this means in practice. \"As long as society discriminates on race, race must be used to remedy that discrimination,\" a House staff summary of testimony in support of Initiative 1000 said. Washington will now be able to set diversity \"goals and timetables.\" Success or failure will be measured with demographic data, so the goals will function as de facto quotas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The new initiative also establishes a Commission on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, made up of gubernatorial appointees, lawmakers and representatives from colleges and identity-based special-interests. The commission can propose or oppose legislation. It also must publish an annual report on \"the progress of all state agencies in achieving diversity, equity, and inclusion in public education, public employment, and public contracting.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The commission will have enforcement powers, and Mr. Wineberry says administrators whose agencies or colleges fall short of diversity goals could face funding cuts, mandatory diversity training, or dismissal. All of the incentives will be for them to make decisions based on identity, not merit, and to lower standards until they yield enough \"qualified\" candidates of a preferred race or gender. Asian-Americans in the state testified about concerns that they will lose opportunities if they're deemed \"overrepresented\" in a college or agency.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In Washington, activists can put an initiative before voters or lawmakers by collecting enough signatures. That was the genesis of Initiative 1000. But groups can also collect signatures to seek a referendum on bills or initiatives recently passed into law. The American Coalition for Equality, which represents many Asian-Americans, has launched an effort to put repeal of Initiative 1000 on the November 2019 ballot. Let's hope this effort succeeds, and meanwhile the U.S. Supreme Court should revisit its cases that allow this racial spoils system.</p>\n"}

Fifty years ago today, a landmark court decision ended this atrocity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The inequities of discrimination evolved along with the slowly deteriorating status of Mexican Americans after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, when Mexico surrendered California to the United States, and from the basic unfairness of many American institutions that until then had been seen only in the South and the cities of the Northeast. These institutions were transplanted to California after the Gold Rush of 1849. But the real troubles surfaced around 1910 when Anglo communities in Southern and Central California began to encounter larger numbers of Mexicans. The new immigrants were attracted by the booming citrus industry or driven north by civil unrest in Mexico, and the deeply rooted Californian Mexican American population multiplied to three times its size by the 1920s. California now was confronted with what was termed \"the Mexican problem\" (sound familiar?).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Common reactions to the \"problem\" involved some form of segregation in practice, if not in law: housing on the \"Mexican side of town\"; \"Mexican seats\" in movie theaters and \"Mexican days\" at the public swimming pools--usually on the day the pool was to be drained and cleaned. But perhaps the most tragic and painful form of segregation was in public education.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In every California community with a sizable Mexican American population, schools were segregated; sometimes it was just a \"Mexican\" room, but most commonly each district had an identified \"Mexican\" school. The Orange County superintendent of schools even denoted each designated school with the word \"Mexican\" in parenthesis in his annual reports.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Southern California had created a segregated agrarian society based on citrus and Mexican American labor much the same as the South had created a cotton society with the work of African Americans. This \"citrus society\" persisted until World War II, when a group of common men and women with an uncommon American spirit decided to fight the system they saw as unjust. They fought not for themselves, but rather for that which strikes passion in all parents: their children's future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In Orange County, Gonzalo Mendez, a tenant farmer in Westminster, and a group of Mexican American World War II veterans asked a fundamental question about their communities: If we are good enough to fight and die alongside Anglos, then why are my children not good enough to attend the same schools as their children? Early in 1945, They filed a lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles against four Orange County school districts--Westminster, Santa Ana, Garden Grove and El Modena (now eastern Orange)--seeking an injunction that would order their schools' integration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Two years later, despite resistance by the school districts, a great deal of effort by community organizers and a tremendous amount of personal time and money expended by the Mendez family, school segregation was no more in California. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled on April 14, 1947, that school districts could not segregate on the basis of national origin--that is, that the authorities could not make children go to separate, even if equal, schools simply because they were of Mexican descent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The case had an impact on American life beyond the \"citrus society.\" Gov. Earl Warren pushed the Legislature into repealing laws that segregated Asian and Native American schoolchildren. (Mexicans were not specifically mentioned in the statutes, but some districts not involved in Mendez argued that Mexicans were Native Americans, while others listed them as \"Spanish\"; Mexicans are, of course, a mix of both.) Warren went on to write the Brown vs. Board of Education decision ending school segregation across the United States, as chief justice of the Supreme Court in 1954.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Mendez case was Brown vs. Board of Education for Mexican Americans in California. While informal segregation replaced legally sanctioned segregation, the decision inspired and gave hope to a people who only wanted an equal opportunity to pursue the American Dream.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am a direct beneficiary of Mendez and the dreams it sought to secure. I grew up four blocks from the \"Mexican\" schools in El Modena, now the site of a supermarket. I didn't learn about them until I went to college and then to law school, and even then it was only through independent research, not in the classroom. In high school, I did learn about the \"Spanish\" and their missions, the Anglo settlers and the Gold Rush, Pat Brown and California water and other important persons and events in California history, but not about the events that most directly affected me, not about the people who came before me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Orange City Councilman Fred Barrera, who attended both segregated and integrated schools, once said, \"Anything you blend comes out better, whether it be stew or cement, but it takes time.\" Things are better, perhaps much better, but hardly complete. I often ask myself why we were not informed of our own history. I suppose it is easier to forget a troubled past then to confront it. But the difficult lessons of the past still have much to teach us about living in the present and shaping the future. Perhaps some of us would not be so quick to judge everyone in our state \"on a level playing field\" or say that there is equal opportunity for all if we were to look at our unpleasant but not too distant past and see how it lingers with us today. For example, only 3% of attorneys in California are Latino, despite all our \"progress\" since Mendez and a Latino population of almost 30%. Before we end programs like affirmative action in our colleges and institute anti-immigrant policies that would remove children from our schools and once again segregate whole populations from society, let us remember our past and strive not to re-create it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The remembering must begin in and be maintained by our schools. Sadly, not one of the four school districts in the landmark Mendez decision has planned a single event commemorating it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gonzalo Mendez, now deceased, and his wife Felicitas recently were honored for their contributions by the Los Angeles County Mexican American Bar Assn. But the Mendez story is still waiting to be retold in a lasting manner, to inform, inspire and protect future generations against a return to the injustices of a bygone era.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PHOTO: CHRISTOPHER J.

{"id": "txt/2731912965.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The United States is no longer the world\u2019s friendliest country to migrants</h2<p>As an immigrant to the United States who has traveled a great deal around the world, I have always been certain that America was the best place for people like me \u2014 people who looked different, with brown skin and a strange name. I remember coming to America as a college student and feeling the openness and generosity of a country born of and made by immigrants. When visiting Britain around the same time, I could sense that I was treated politely but as an outsider.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But in 2019, a tweet from Britain's then chancellor of the exchequer, Sajid Javid, caught my eye: \"Britain is the most successful multiracial democracy in the world.\" He tweeted something similar last week after the appointment of Rishi Sunak as prime minister of Britain. So I spent some time looking at the data.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Migrant Integration Policy Index measures policies to integrate migrants in dozens of countries around the world. As of 2019, the United States is in the top 10, but in the bottom half. In general between 2014 and 2019, the average country studied improved its score by two points. The United States on the other hand retreated by two points.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The story is largely one of the rise of the rest. Countries such as Canada have long been welcoming to immigrants but have gotten even better. Any would-be immigrant with technical skills and strong academic standing knows that it is easier to get a green card equivalent in Canada or Britain (or Ireland or Sweden) than in the United States these days. And since the Trump crackdown in every area of immigration \u2014 from business visas to work permits \u2014 the experience has become even more hellish and demeaning for people trying to move to the United States.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Others have also become far more tolerant. If you look at a recent Pew Research Center survey on attitudes toward national identity, you see that major European countries are becoming more tolerant and inclusive. The percentage who say that to truly belong you need to be born in that country is about the same in Britain, France and the United States. (Germany is even lower.) And those who say you have to be Christian to belong make up 14 percent in France, 20 percent in Britain, 23 percent in Germany and a high of 35 percent in the United States.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Britain did not score as high on the Migrant Integration Policy Index in 2019 as the United States, but the more you observe the day-to-day reality, Javid's comments do not look like an empty boast. (Though Canada likely does better than Britain or the United States on any objective set of measures.) When Boris Johnson resigned, of the eight candidates who came forward to replace him, four were members of ethnic minorities (Sunak, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch and Nadhim Zahawi). And not one \u2014 unlike, say, Bobby Jindal or Nikki Haley \u2014 has converted to Christianity. Sunak took his oath of office on the Bhagavad Gita and lit Diwali lamps at his 10 Downing Street residence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Tory Party, the party of the old English aristocracy, has had an explosion of diversity. In contrast, about 90 percent of Republicans in Congress are White and virtually all the Republicans are Christian. Much of the credit in Britain should go to David Cameron, the former Conservative prime minister who took it upon himself to make his party more open to minorities of all kinds, including gender minorities. Once the party put out the welcome mat, it should not have come as a surprise that so many migrants proved to be natural Tories. After all, the Indian community in Britain is socially conservative, often with an entrepreneurial streak (including an aversion to high taxes). The same is true of Indian Americans, but because the Republican Party so powerfully signals its embrace of White racialist politics, it turns off many minorities who would agree with them on most issues. It is also worth noting that Britain does not have affirmative action policies, which might explain why there is less resentment toward minorities who have succeeded there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>America has had distinct advantages compared with other countries that have allowed it to thrive \u2014 an open market, business-friendly policies \u2014 but many of these have been copied by other countries. I always believed that being truly welcoming to immigrants was America's last and greatest competitive advantage. It does appear that now others are catching up or even beating the United States at a game that it invented.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1439573684.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Supreme Court Returns</h2<p>The Supreme Court begins a new term on Monday, even as the landmark rulings of last term continue to reverberate. The court has agreed to hear more than 50 cases so far on disputes both familiar and fresh: from affirmative action and freedom of speech, to campaign finance and the president's power to make recess appointments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No case yet promises the high-profile splash of rulings on national health care, voting rights or same-sex marriage, but in many of them, long-established Supreme Court precedents may be at risk.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION A familiar issue, but this time the question is whether a state may amend its constitution to prohibit the consideration of race or sex in public university admissions decisions. Ten years ago, the court ruled that the University of Michigan Law School could use race as one factor in assessing applications. Michigan voters responded by passing a constitutional amendment banning the practice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The court in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action will now consider whether that amendment violates the equal protection clause. The court's very narrow decision last term in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin did not change the state of the law on the use of race to achieve diversity. This case risks doing so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>CAMPAIGN FINANCE In one of the most closely watched cases of the term, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, the court will consider the constitutionality of overall limits on how much an individual donor may give directly to federal candidates, party committees and PACs in a two-year election cycle.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>McCutcheon is the first major campaign finance case to reach the court since its controversial 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which struck down a ban on independent spending in campaigns by corporations and labor unions. In a 1976 case, Buckley v. Valeo, the court upheld limits on direct political contributions to prevent corruption. That precedent is being tested again in the McCutcheon case; the justices should reaffirm it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND RELIGION In McCullen v. Coakley, anti-abortion protesters are challenging a Massachusetts law that sets a 35-foot \"buffer zone\" around health care clinics where abortions are performed. The Supreme Court upheld a similar buffer zone in 2000, but the protesters in this case say the law discriminates against them based on their point of view. That earlier ruling may not survive because four of the justices in the 2000 majority have left the court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In Town of Greece v. Galloway, the court will decide whether the First Amendment permits a prayer before a town board meeting. A 30-year-old Supreme Court decision says that nonsectarian legislative prayers do not violate the Constitution, but in this case, all but a handful of the prayers were performed by Christian clergy. The question is whether this will make a difference to the justices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ABORTION Cline v. Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice deals with the constitutionality of an Oklahoma law that requires doctors to use abortion-inducing drugs precisely as the Food and Drug Administration approved them 13 years ago. The law's challengers point out that standard medical practice has changed and doctors routinely prescribe the drugs differently now (at much lower doses and two weeks later into a pregnancy), which is fully permitted by federal law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Earlier Supreme Court rulings have struck down laws that pose an \"undue burden\" on abortion rights. The court should see Oklahoma's tactics for what they are -- part of an effort to undo the right to choose under the guise of protecting women's health.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PRESIDENTIAL POWER National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning addresses issues as vast as the separation of powers and as small as the meaning of the word \"the.\" The case involves the president's constitutional power to make appointments \"during the recess of the Senate,\" as President Obama arguably did in January 2012, when he appointed three members to the N.L.R.B. The board then ruled against a bottling company called Noel Canning in a labor dispute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The company appealed, arguing, among other things, that the board members' appointment was improper because the Constitution's use of the phrase \"the recess\" refers only to the period when Congress is between sessions, and not to a break within a session. The Obama administration points out that presidents for more than a century have made appointments during breaks when Congress was out of town. Accepting the company's extremely narrow reading of the Constitution would invalidate a practice that has resulted in hundreds of appointments over the years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Beyond these cases, the new term could hold other surprises. Several of last year's biggest cases were not accepted by the court until after the term began.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For instance, the justices have yet to decide whether to hear an appeal on the issue of the Affordable Care Act's requirement that the health plans of private for-profit employers cover birth control. Several companies have challenged the rule on the grounds that it violates their religious freedom, and federal appeals courts have split on the issue, which makes it likely that the court will step in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On many of these cases, the outcome may depend again on a single vote -- and often, but not always, that means Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote decided more 5-4 cases than any other member of the court last year.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/431032296.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>African-American Progress in the New South</h2<p>After a rocky and sometimes violent start, American colleges were so swiftly and quietly integrated that a miracle slipped by unnoticed. What the country reaped is partly explained in a new report from Princeton University Press, showing that a mere 20 years of affirmative action at the elite universities has integrated the professions, dramaticallyexpanded the black middle class -- and dismantled a racial castesystem that was 400 years in the making.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Conservative ideologues discount this progress out of hostility to affirmative action. But some civil rights activists minimize progress too, fearful that celebrating it would suggest that the struggle for justice is finished. This preference for pessimism has dominated the debate and clearly shaped the latest study from the Southern Education Foundation, which monitors the 19 Southern and border states that once maintained segregated college systems.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Titled ''Miles to Go,'' the S.E.F.'s report focuses on public colleges in those states -- and finds worries aplenty, with little cause for joy. Reading the grim headlines that described this report, one might conclude that the North was gliding toward racial equality while the South stubbornly stifled it. But a fair examination of the facts shows that the South has indeed made great strides.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The S.E.F. report makes the legitimate point that African-Americans in the South go to college at a lower rate than whites. The report also notes the need for more financial aid, given that many Southern black families earn less than $10,000 a year.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the S.E.F. loads its case by limiting its analysis to public colleges -- when almost a third of blacks in the South go to private schools. It also focuses on comparisons between the black enrollment rates in Southern public colleges and the percentage of blacks in the general population, rather than on the more meaningful comparison between black enrollment rates in the South and the same rates elsewhere in the country. The unintended message here is that 25 years of Federal intervention on behalf of affirmative action has made no difference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Angry that its mission was being undermined, the United Negro College Fund issued a blistering rebuttal through its policy arm, the Frederick Patterson Research Institute, saying that the S.E.F. had ''consistently selected data that would show negative . . . while ignoring positive data.'' The Patterson data show that black enrollment and graduation numbers have risen steadily each year in every state, including the states that made up the Confederacy. Black enrollment at traditionally white schools in the South has grown 35 percent over the last 20 years -- about 10 percentage points more than the nation as a whole. The number of bachelor's degrees awarded to blacks at white public institutions has grown 107 percent in the South -- more than three times the growth rate in the Northeast.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The South resisted integration longer than the North. But when major research universities are ranked by percentage of black enrollment, 13 of the top 20 schools are in states covered by the S.E.F. report. One school on this list has the highest black enrollment in the South -- the University of Alabama-Birmingham, where 22 percent of the students are black and black doctoral enrollment has risen 133 percent in the last decade. Also on the list are Emory University, Georgia Tech, the University of North Carolina, the University of Virginia and Louisiana State University. The S.E.F. should have studied how these schools succeeded so that other schools might replicate the effort.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The S.E.F. intended to bring national attention to a serious problem. The same Southern states that created Jim Crow college systems -- and starved the black public colleges -- have responded to desegregation lawsuits by raising standards at the black colleges while ignoring the dismal primary and secondary schools that make it impossible for the bulk of Southern blacks to qualify under the new standards. Though grave, this problem is hardly limited to the South. State systems all over the North -- including historically liberal New York -- are inching toward policies that will shut out black and Latino students. Unless the states wake up, the policies will result in a new social catastrophe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The S.E.F. clearly meant to spur the old Confederacy to action on this problem. But by ignoring progress, the report played into the hands of affirmative action's enemies and placed its own motives in question.</p>\n"}

Should male African American players be fired because their gender and skin pigmentation are overrepresented? Absolutely not. Equal opportunity does not mean equal outcomes. This is a concept that WAPO [Washington Post] and the Obama administration simply can't wrap their brains around.

{"id": "txt/2626791227.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Upward Mobility: Why There Aren't More Black Coaches in the NFL</h2<p>Not long after Barack Obama became president, he made an appearance on the \"Late Show With David Letterman.\" It was September 2009, and the administration's plans to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system had not been going over well in the polls. Some people, including former President Jimmy Carter, were insisting that criticism of Mr. Obama was racially motivated. Asked about it, Mr. Obama demurred. \"It's important to remember,\" he said to Mr. Letterman, \"that I was actually black before the election.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Obama's response was not only classy and amusing, but it was based on a certain logic that seems lost on those who are quick to reach for the race card. Last week, Brian Flores, who was recently fired as head coach of the Miami Dolphins, filed a lawsuit against the National Football League alleging that the league discriminates against black coaches. But Mr. Flores was also black when he was hired.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's no secret that professional sports has a long, ugly history of racial exclusion, and it's certainly possible that the Dolphins organization is guilty of discriminatory hiring practices. But is it plausible? \"Dolphins owner Stephen Ross ran the 'blackest' organization in the NFL,\" sportswriter Jason Whitlock observed in a recent column. \"At one time, his head coach, general manager, assistant general manager, defensive coordinator, and several members of his ownership group were all black.\" At what point did Mr. Ross become a bigot? When he decided to fire Brian Flores?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a statement released by his lawyers, Mr. Flores said the lawsuit is not about \"my personal goals.\" Rather, \"my sincere hope is that by standing up against systemic racism in the NFL, others will join me to ensure that positive change is made for generations to come.\" Maybe, but the reality is that lawsuits such as this one could hamper efforts to increase the number of black coaches in the NFL. Teams might be less likely to hire someone they can't fire without being labeled racist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A similar phenomenon played out in faculty hiring at colleges and universities after affirmative action was implemented in the 1970s. Schools were reluctant to hire a professor who might not make tenure, lest they be accused of discrimination and face expensive lawsuits and unfavorable press. Unlike among white academics, only the sure things got job offers, which reduced the overall number of minority faculty hires.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like others who invoke \"systemic racism,\" Mr. Flores and his allies point to statistical disparities as proof of discrimination. About 70% of NFL players are black, yet the league currently has only two black head coaches and one who has a black father and describes himself as multiracial. In 2003 the league adopted a rule that required teams to interview minority candidates for top coaching jobs. Since then, 122 head coaches have been hired, and all but 17 of them have been white. In recent decades, the number of black head coaches has fluctuated. In 2004 there were five. The number rose to eight by 2011, fell to four in 2013 and then rose back to eight in 2017. Those numbers may not be as high as some would like, but they don't look like solid evidence of racist hiring practices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We also shouldn't ignore other plausible explanations for this racial imbalance that may have nothing to do with racial bias. Progressive icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg spent 27 years on the Supreme Court while hiring only one black law clerk. Was she guilty of discrimination, or was she simply choosing from a pool of candidates that, for whatever reason, included relatively few blacks?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Head coaches in the NFL more recently have tended to follow a certain career path. An insightful article last month by the sportswriter Shalise Manza Young noted that, since 2016, three-quarters of the 40 head coaches hired had worked as offensive coordinators. In 2021 only seven of the league's 33 offensive coordinators were black.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ms. Young then pointed to another potential factor in the racial makeup of pro football coaches: old-fashioned nepotism. \"By the NFL's own data for its 2020 diversity and inclusion report, nine of that year's 32 head coaches were related to a current or former coach in the league, whether by blood or marriage,\" she wrote. The same applied to the league's 63 coordinators and position coaches, 53 of whom were white.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is no doubt a problem for a league that aspires to have more of the coaches on the sidelines look like the players on the field. But it is not a problem of racial animosity toward blacks who want to coach in the NFL. And it's not at all clear that Mr. Flores's channeling of Colin Kaepernick will help more get hired.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Flawed Logic of Disparate Impact Leads Nowhere Good\" -- WSJ Feb. 15, 2022)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By Jason L.

{"id": "txt/419682565.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Race not only `bias' in college admissions</h2<p>Stop the presses! I have run across what appears to be several classic examples of unfair preferential treatment in college admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So shocking are they that I hesitate to report them for fear of widespread howling, heart palpitations and fainting spells.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But I feel it is my civic duty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After all, some of these examples happened at the University of Michigan, whose race-conscious admissions policy the U.S. Supreme Court has decided to review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That case, Grutter vs. Bollinger, is destined to be a big deal. It's the high court's first swing at race in college admissions since its famous 1978 Bakke vs. Regents of University of California opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then, Justice Lewis Powell's waffling decision tried to have it both ways. At best, it said that race can be a factor in college admissions as long as it was not the only factor. Twenty-five years later, lower courts--and the rest of America--disagree widely over how much of a \"factor\" is too much.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now comes a new lead plaintiff, Barbara Grutter, who complains that she was turned down by the University of Michigan's law school in 1996 even though her 3.8 grade point average and high test scores were higher than most of the black students who were admitted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>She is joined by two white applicants, Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher, who were B students at Michigan high schools. They were turned down in the mid-1990s, while some black and Hispanic applicants with similar lesser academic records got in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That much is not contested. If you think of college admissions as a reward for high grades and test scores and nothing else, pure and simple, it is easy to believe that Grutter and her fellow plaintiffs got shafted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But there's another group of students whom the law school admitted even though they, too, had lower grades and test scores than Grutter. This second group happens to be white.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The same year that Grutter's application was rejected, 23 other white applicants were admitted to the law school, even though they had lower grade point averages and test scores than she did, according to the university's figures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The two undergraduate plaintiffs in her case similarly were rejected while as many as 42 whites or Asians, which the university calls \"non-underrepresented minorities,\" were admitted with both lower grades and lower test scores.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The same pattern of preferential treatment for some whites over others appeared in the 1998 case, Hopwood vs. University of Texas Law School. Cheryl Hopwood was one of four whites who felt the law school unfairly discriminated against them in favor of blacks and Hispanics. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, declaring that race cannot be used as a factor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court declined to review that case, even though more than 100 white students were admitted who had lower grade point averages or test scores than Hopwood did.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How does this happen? Because, as important as grades and test scores might be, they never have been the sole factors on which universities base their admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The University of Michigan, for example, has 13 preference categories. They include geographic origins, talents, foreign origins, rural origins, family income and children of alumni over the age of 50. Race is one of those categories.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One friend, a Northwestern University professor, quips that he got into Princeton \"under affirmative action for Greek kids from Albuquerque.\" Another friend, a Washington lawyer, says he got into Harvard under \"affirmative action for Nebraskans.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My point is this: In comparison to the major boost that affirmative action has given to blacks and Latinos since the 1960s, it has not been a huge inconvenience to very many whites, including the plaintiffs in the Michigan case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Michigan's undergraduate program, for example, received more than 25,000 applications this year for only 5,187 places. Even if affirmative action were eliminated, the odds for any particular white or Asian student would improve only marginally.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet it is a natural human tendency for everyone to suspect that they were the one who got shafted by racial quotas--and perceptions mean more than statistics in matters of politics and law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now 25 years after Bakke and almost 40 years after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is time to reassess affirmative action. It is unfortunate that the reassessment is coming in the high court, which tends to wield a heavy hatchet, instead of legislatures, where it could be debated more thoroughly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sooner or later, I suspect that it will take the high court to force our politicians to come up with race-blind remedies we should have had all along for the social inequities every American of goodwill should want to end.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>E-mail: cptime@aol.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398728087.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Real Ronnie White</h2<p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- When Ronnie White took his seat inside this city's red-brick state Supreme Court building in 1995, he became the first African-American on a Missouri high court that had once ruled so infamously against Dred Scott. But when Ronnie White took his seat in January in front of the microphones at John Ashcroft's Senate confirmation hearings, he was no longer making history. He was practicing politics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Scarcely two years ago, Judge White became the first federal judicial nominee since Robert Bork to suffer the humiliation of a defeat on the Senate floor, in a nay vote led by then-Sen. Ashcroft. In the event, Mr. Ashcroft was confirmed as attorney general. But the price was a public drama that virtually canonized his old nemesis while tinging his earlier opposition to Judge White's appointment with tones of racism -- a boon for that wing of the Democratic Party which continues to insist the real reason for the opposition to our \"first black president\" and his appointees was GOP bigotry.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the current wisdom that George W. Bush would never be foolish enough to renominate him to the bench -- as House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt and the Congressional Black Caucus demand -- his is a record that still deserves attention. Such is the judge's iconic status that at a meeting with Mr. Ashcroft earlier this month, the caucus even managed to secure the attorney general's pledge not to oppose a new White nomination to the federal bench if the president were to make it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By contrast, the Ronnie White that Missourians know is a far more textured figure than the one presented to America. This is the Ronnie White whose \"outspokenness\" was characterized by his leading press champion, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, as bordering on \"vituperation\"; who flunked a bar exam that nine out of 10 Missouri law students pass; who was sued by the state of Missouri for back support for an out-of-wedlock child in a case whose records remain sealed after a murky settlement. This Ronnie White has been quick to find racism in the comments of fellow judges, misled the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was once forced to rewrite an opinion because its language was so over the top.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let's start with Judge White's appearance in Washington. Missouri's Rules of the Court expressly forbid a sitting justice from testifying \"voluntarily,\" absent a subpoena or some extraordinary circumstance. Now, he may have sought an ethical ruling from the state's Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of Judges. But the commission says its work is confidential, and Judge White would not return phone calls asking whether he asked for such an opinion -- or whether the commission is pursuing complaints of impropriety resulting from his appearance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As we all know, Judge White did appear before the Senate -- without much prodding. And though the news stories all dutifully reported how he stopped short of calling Mr. Ashcroft a racist, the entire Beltway well understood that his mere appearance on behalf of a political prosecution that was arguing just that clearly lent his imprimatur to those charges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nor was this his first wink at politicking. Last September, barely six weeks before the bitterly contested Ashcroft-Carnahan Senate election, Judge White appeared at a Missouri Bar Association forum on diversity with the late Mel Carnahan, where he warned about the \"chilling effect\" Carnahan's defeat might have on young African Americans. At this same forum, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer told the audience, \"I hope the citizens of Missouri will remember [White's rejection] when it comes time to vote for U.S. Senate.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nor has Judge White been shy of accusing fellow judges of racism. The first was Judge William Corrigan, a Democrat who, in a case involving a black man accused of murder, remarked that it was not for him to decide whether jurors were white or black. \"Years ago, they used to say one drop of blood constitutes black,\" he continued. \"I don't know what black means.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Judge White went ballistic. In a majority opinion ordering a new hearing for a convicted murderer, he insisted that Judge Corrigan's statement \"reeks of racial animus,\" proving that his \"mental processes are irrevocably tainted with prejudice.\" He further cited a 1983 Post-Dispatch story quoting Judge Corrigan joking about needing a black judge to do the cooking at a barbecue. Judge White's opinion did not mention that the same story also quoted Judge Corrigan as denying having made the remark. After an outcry, Judge White was forced to rewrite his majority opinion, purging it of what the Post-Dispatch called its \"injudicious\" sentiments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not long thereafter, Judge White again pinned the scarlet \"R\" on another judge, Earl Blackwell, who was switching from the Democratic Party to the GOP. Judge Blackwell's offense was a press release on his decision that included the following line: \"While minorities need to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hardworking taxpayers in this country.\" Colleagues on the Missouri court read this as a criticism, however maladroit, of affirmative action as a political priority. But Judge White insisted that \"no honest reading\" could see it as anything other than racism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I met lots of people in Missouri who don't much like Judge Corrigan. But even those who don't like him do not suggest any minority defendant has ever suffered from bias in his courtroom (or Judge Blackwell's). Yet the accusation of racism will forever taint both men. \"If he's entitled to his reputation,\" says Judge Corrigan, \"am I not entitled to mine?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With respect to his own record, Judge White's defenders managed to deflect one key charge against him -- that he was soft on crime -- by showing that he voted with the court majority in many capital punishment cases. But the fact remains that he was five times more likely to dissent -- and always in favor of the defendant -- than any other justice. And when asked himself to list the 10 most significant cases he'd personally litigated (in the questionnaire he submitted to the U.S. Senate in 1998), eight were criminal defenses, including one man who had sexually assaulted a stroke patient in her hospital bed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a column in the Washington Times, moreover, Tony Blankley reported how Ronnie White failed a bar exam that was passed by 88% of lawyers on their first try, had been put on academic probation in law school, and had been unable to list (on that same Senate questionnaire) a single significant article, book or report on the law he had written.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And Mr. Blankley also reported on an aspect of Judge White that still has lawyers here scratching their heads: The state of Missouri sued him claiming that he owed $11,625 in back support for an illegitimate child. But shortly after his nomination to the Missouri high court, the case ended in a finding that he had overpaid by $75. The child's existence only emerged after the Post-Dispatch received a tip. It further emerged that, once the legal wrangling began, Judge White ended his relationship with his son, who was then in his early teens.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Judge White's claim that the boy's mother saw his paternity as \"winning the lottery\" is eminently plausible. Still, there is a legitimate public issue raised here: Did Judge White reveal the boy's existence on his questionnaire for the Missouri high court? It is impossible to say, because he would not return my phone calls. The only people, moreover, who have seen the case records are Judge White and the Post-Dispatch reporter he spoke to.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One issue that did pop up at the Ashcroft hearings involved an allegation that during his time in the Missouri Legislature, then-Rep. White called a vote on a controversial abortion bill in the committee he chaired after first telling pro-life opponents there would be no vote. Asked by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) to explain, Judge White stated he called the vote only because the bill's sponsor, Ted House, was being belligerent and \"repeatedly demanded that we take up his bill.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But back in 1992, when these events occurred, the Post-Dispatch ran a story that quoted then-Rep. White as conceding he'd promised no vote but saying he called for a vote when he got mad at Mr. House. \"The most egregious thing [about Judge White's explanation to the Senate],\" says Mr. House, now a state senator, \"is [his claim] that I was pushing for a vote.\" In sharp contrast to Judge White, Sen. House's account today remains the same as the one he gave in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter sent a week after that vote, characterizing it as \"undemocratic, illegal and deceitful.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, there is one issue that never did make it to the public record: a threatened libel suit against then-Sen. Ashcroft by attorneys representing Judge White. This is a curious threat indeed, in that even a first-year law student would know that a public official's statements on a matter of official business about the public record of another public official constitute just about the most protected speech in the land. Either Justice White was ignorant about the law, or he was well aware of the law and meant the letter as an act of political intimidation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With all these issues largely in the public record, why did they not come up in either the White or Ashcroft hearings?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Manifestly, part of the answer is an unwritten rule against questioning the credentials of African-American nominees. There are those who see such questioning as veiled racism, as well as those who know they'll be accused of racism if they open their mouths. But Mr. Ashcroft bears some responsibility himself. Probably even Ronnie White's closest friends don't believe the attorney general a bigot; after all, his own record shows he voted overwhelmingly to confirm minorities -- and, as Missouri governor, even appointed one of Judge White's law partners, Sandra Farragut-Hemphill, to the state bench.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Maybe Mr. Ashcroft was, as his friends say, too much of a gentleman to raise Ronnie White's credentials two years ago. And maybe the Bush administration decided that it did not want to pick a fight with the African-American community over an attorney general who looked pretty certain of being confirmed. Whatever the reason, it may come back to haunt them both. Indeed, Mr. Ashcroft's pledge to the Black Caucus that he would no longer oppose the nomination of Judge White to the federal judiciary will be taken as vindication of the Clinton argument that it was about race all along.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is the Democrats' great unsung victory of the Ashcroft hearings. At a time when House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R., Texas) has written to the NAACP to complain about \"racial McCarthyism\" against Republicans, the halo now raised over Judge White's head only guarantees more of the same. For a wing of the Democratic Party whose electoral strategy depends on painting a vote for the GOP as a vote for burning down African-American churches or chaining black men to pick-up trucks, it hardly matters whether Judge White ever makes it to the federal bench. He's far more valuable as a martyr.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. McGurn is a member of the Journal's editorial board.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2214970115.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Affirmative Reaction</h2<p>In the coming days the Supreme Court is expected to rule on a case that could further restrict the use of race as a factor in college admissions. A white student denied a place at the University of Texas at Austin claims that although Texas uses race sparingly in its college admissions, the state is still cheating white students and violating the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The betting among court watchers is that the verdict will be another setback for racial affirmative action. As a supporter of diversity, I wonder: could that be a blessing in disguise?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am not a disinterested bystander on the subject. As an editor, I have long believed that hiring and promoting talented minorities was not just a moral obligation but a professional imperative: to comprehend a disparate world and present it to a disparate audience, it helps to have a reporting and editing staff with a diversity of experience and perspective. As a trustee of a liberal arts college, I\u2019ve supported admission of black and Latino students not just as a remedy for historic injustice but because something fundamental is missing from a campus where everybody is pretty much alike. Diversity tends to make institutions more creative, more adaptable, more productive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But over the years, following the work of scholars like Richard Kahlenberg at the Century Foundation, Anthony Carnevale of Georgetown and Marta Tienda of Princeton, I\u2019ve come to think there may be a better way to accomplish diversity: namely, by shifting attention from race to class. The idea is controversial, the execution is complicated and it doesn\u2019t come cheap, but it promises a richer kind of variety \u2014 and it is less likely to run afoul of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We already have a growing body of experience in several states where race-based affirmative action has been curtailed by courts or ballot initiatives. Universities in those states have tried creative ways to achieve diversity by weighing economic factors. Some have expanded their outreach and financial aid to low-income or working-class students of all races, or to children of single parents, or to students from families where no one has gone to college. Some have partnered with disadvantaged high schools. Texas replaced most racial preferences with a rule that any student in the top 10 percent of his or her high school graduating class is assured admission to a state college, thus greatly increasing college access for poor kids. (Most University of Texas admissions come from this pool. The rest are chosen using a menu of factors, including race, which is what the Supreme Court case is about.) California, where Proposition 209 banned all racial preferences in 1996, employs a similar system, taking the top 9 percent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope the Supreme Court will allow universities to continue using race as one factor in admissions, at least for a time. There is no question that it is a relatively efficient way to make higher education less monochromatic. But sooner or later, racial preferences, which were originally designed to be temporary, will end. Whatever the court decides in the pending case, it is time for college administrators to shift their attention decisively away from racial preferences to an affirmative action based on class. Here\u2019s why:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. Racial preferences are highly unpopular. They contribute to the kind of resentments politicians on the right pander to in code, from Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cwelfare queens\u201d to Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent.\u201d On the other hand, polls show that most Americans are willing to give a leg up to students who have grown up in poverty. Of course, the popular thing is not always the right thing, but Americans are more likely to support the taxes to pay for high-quality education if they think the system is fair.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. Economic inequality is increasingly recognized as an even greater menace to our national well-being than racial discrimination. Huge and growing disparities of wealth contribute to a shift of political power from the many to the privileged few, retard economic growth and productivity, and undermine the values we profess. So affirmative action that puts poor and working-class students on the on-ramp to success is good for our economy, legitimizing for our democracy and consistent with our values. Racism is still a toxic reality in our country. But the gulf between the wealthy and the poor is wider and even more socially corrosive than the gap between black and white. And basing college admissions on economic status does not mean giving up on racial diversity, because...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3. As it happens, a well-designed program of socioeconomic preference also increases minority enrollment. Racial preferences don\u2019t help all that much in promoting class diversity, because selective colleges heavily favor minorities from middle-class and affluent families; but class-based preferences favor minorities, because blacks and Hispanics are more heavily represented among the poor. It is true that affirmative action based on economic disadvantage has not proved to be quite as effective as explicit racial preferences at bolstering minority enrollment \u2014 \u201cNothing is as good a proxy for race as race itself,\u201d says Sean Reardon of Stanford, who favors using both class and race. But a class-based system can come close. At the University of California\u2019s Irvine campus, which introduced class-based admissions after Proposition 209, the number of students who are the first in their families to attend college has risen dramatically, and black and Hispanic enrollment has roughly doubled. There are many other examples in a 2012 Century Foundation study. As Kahlenberg and Carnavale have pointed out, minorities would benefit even more from class-based admissions if the formula took into account one indicator that is generally not counted: a family\u2019s net worth. Because wealth is accumulated over generations, it captures the legacy of slavery and segregation much better than income.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4. The impact of affirmative action for the poor seems to trickle down. Thurston Domina, an assistant professor of education at Irvine, studied the disadvantaged high schools that now feed into the Texas 10 percent program. He found that the lure of assured admission and a few college scholarships significantly raised the aspirations and performance of students in those poor schools. Attendance was up, college applications were up, test scores were up, enrollment in advanced courses was up. There is anecdotal evidence that the same thing is happening under California\u2019s program. This is particularly exciting given that the most urgent need for raising educational standards occurs long before kids graduate from high school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5. One argument that doesn\u2019t get much attention is that enrolling students from poor and working-class backgrounds is likely to increase ideological diversity. Conservatives may exaggerate the extent to which universities are bastions of left-leaning godlessness, but it is fair to say that on most campuses social conservatives, the deeply religious and the children of military families are scarcely heard. As a result, the political discourse can be glib, predictable and impoverished. Class-based diversity would oblige students of different beliefs to test and sharpen their convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The biggest obstacle to class-based affirmative action, as Richard Perez-Pena pointed out in The Times the other day, is the obvious one: cost. Poor and working-class students are by definition in need of more financial aid. That is why universities have shown little interest in switching. It\u2019s cheaper to bring in students of color from middle-class or affluent families. (It also brings in kids with higher SAT test scores, which count so heavily in the obsessively watched college rankings.) Cost is the reason that even many proponents of class-based affirmative action favor what Tienda calls \u201ca holistic approach\u201d \u2014 class and race both.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to that,\u201d counters Kahlenberg, \u201cbut I think that in the real world universities will never get around to addressing class as long as they have race as one of their instruments.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If he\u2019s wrong about that, it\u2019s up to the universities to prove it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Meet The New York Times\u2019s Editorial Board \u00bb</p>\n"}

The position, on which the Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet this week, has been vacant since early this year. A \"no\" vote will mean it stays vacant well into next year if not beyond.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The objections that have been raised to the nomination are not to Mr. Lee's professional competence. Rather, they have to do with the administration's views, which he reflects, as to the permissible outer bounds of affirmative action. The Republicans who are objecting on these grounds are thoroughly entitled to do so. Philosophy is fair game in voting to fill a position such as this. But we think that in this case they make a mistake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Lee has spent his entire professional career as a civil rights litigator, most recently as western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He has the views you might expect of one with such a history. Some critics have described him on the strength of those views, and that record, as an extremist, outside the mainstream of the law. But that is not so, as even such of his former adversaries as Los Angeles's Republican mayor, Richard Riordan, attest. Nor does it make sense, if he is rejected, to expect the administration to nominate someone of appreciably different views.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given the state of the law, and given his place in the pecking order, the holder of this position has less discretion than the debate surrounding the nomination would suggest. Affirmative action offers plenty of legitimate issues for debate, but this nomination seems to us the wrong vehicle. Unless you think the president will fold, to make it the vehicle is basically to say that for the rest of the administration, this position will go unfilled -- in which case the same decisions, such as they are, will still be made by the same administration according to the same philosophy. Do senators who in the past have complained with cause about vacancies in the upper echelons of the Justice Department think that somehow, in this case, a vacancy will help?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There had been reports prior to yesterday that some Republicans were offering the administration a deal. They would vote for Mr. Lee if the administration would promise not to support an appeal to the Supreme Court of the constitutionality of California's Proposition 209, approved by the voters last year, which bars the use of race or gender as criteria in state hiring, contracting by the state or admission to state colleges. That kind of hostage-taking -- a vote for a nominee in return for a promise not to pursue a particular lawsuit -- is different from opposing a nominee's philosophy, and is wrong. The Supreme Court mooted the issue to some extent yesterday by saying it wouldn't hear the Proposition 209 appeal, so there's nothing for the government to join.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Senate ought to confirm this nomination. The philosophical and political issues ought to be argued in another context.</p>\n"}

But he makes up for his modest numbers in exposure \u2014 announcing his candidacy in a Wall Street Journal opinion essay, pandering to the National Rifle Association at its convention and making the cable news rounds. He\u2019s also the author of several books, including \u201cWoke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America\u2019s Social Justice Scam\u201d and \u201cNation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit and the Path Back to Excellence,\u201d and \u200chas largely staked his campaign\u200c on anti-wokeness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ramaswamy has tried cozying up to \u200cDonald Trump \u2014 who leads Republican primary polls by a wide margin \u2014 including by saying in February that he doubted he\u2019d wind up as one of the targets of Trump\u2019s trademark vitriol \u201cbecause we\u2019re friends. I think we have a deep, mutual respect for one another. We\u2019re both energetic people.\u201d And many of Ramaswamy\u2019s views aren\u2019t far from those of Gov. Ron De\u200cSantis\u200c \u2014 who is polling a distant second behind Trump and is another anti-woke crusader.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When he began his campaign, Ramaswamy tweeted: \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a national identity crisis. Faith, patriotism & hard work have disappeared. Wokeism, climatism & gender ideology have replaced them.\u201d His tweet came with a video that quotes Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech \u2014 the only King speech Republicans ever seem to quote.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ramaswamy has checked many of Republicans\u2019 current ideological boxes, saying he wants to \u201cshut down\u201d the F.B.I., declaring \u201cI will end affirmative action in America\u201d and calling for raising the voting age to 25 unless younger voters enroll in the military, work as first responders or pass citizenship tests. So it\u2019s not surprising that he\u2019s quickly become a darling of the right. What initially surprised me, though, was an essay this week in Politico Magazine by the former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang \u2014 a lawyer turned tech entrepreneur turned politician \u2014 advising Ramaswamy on how to win the Republican nomination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But after I thought about it for a moment, I realized it\u2019s not that surprising, after all.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I started out admiring Yang. When we met on the set of \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher\u201d in 2019, I was impressed. He had a refreshing way of explaining his policy proposals, particularly the economic ones\u200c, with clarity and charm. I called him a \u201cfuturist among conventionalists and Bolsheviks.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A few months after dropping out of the race, he voiced qualified support for reparations, telling Time: \u201cThis country was built on the backs of slaves, and we owe them a massive debt. And I\u2019m for H.R.-40, the bill that explores what reparations would look like,\u201d a statement that suggested that he understood the centrality of race and racism in American history, regardless of where anyone might come down on the issue of reparations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the more he revealed \u200chimself, particularly around racial issues, the more \u200c\u200cI was \u200cput off: His campaign-trail jokes that \u200c\u200clean\u200ced into the Asian American model minority stereotyp\u200c\u200ce \u2014 \u201cthe opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math,\u201d \u201cI am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors\u200c\u201d \u2014 caused\u200c \u200ca lot of Asian Americans\u200c, and me, to bristle\u200c.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the early days of the pandemic, in a ham-handed attempt to address rising anti-Asian hate, Yang wrote, \u201cWe Asian Americans need to embrace and show our Americanness in ways we never have before\u201d \u2014 as if the problem were Asian Americans failing to prove their Americanness and not vile anti-Asian sentiment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u200cDuring his run for mayor of New York in 2021, he said, \u201cI moved to Georgia to help win the Senate,\u201d which struck me as trying to give himself too much credit for the electi\u200con of two Democratic senators that year \u2014 and not enough credit to Georgians who\u2019d worked for years to protect voting rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last year \u200cYang \u200cdefended the podcaster Joe Rogan for his use of the N-word, tweeting, \u201cI don\u2019t think Joe Rogan is a racist \u2014 the man interacts with and works with black people literally all of the time,\u201d before \u200cdeleting the tweet and apologiz\u200c\u200cing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u200c\u200cIn March on his own podcast, he questioned the Democratic Party\u2019s decision to make South Carolina\u200c \u2014 \u200ca state \u200c\u200cwhere most \u200cDemocratic voters are Black\u200c\u200c \u2014 \u200cthe first primary on \u200c\u200cits \u200ccalendar, suggesting \u200cthat \u200cthe move\u200c \u200csent this message: \u201cSorry, rural white Midwesterners, not a priority for the Democratic Party anymore.\u200c\u201d\u200c</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you add all of this up, you get the sense that what Yang is offering is a less barbed but still disingenuous platform of anti-wokeness, that now a big part of his brand is downplaying the significance of race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Why? Was this how he always felt but he was able to hide it when he needed the votes of a diverse Democratic electorate?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Or does it illustrate the way that a type of politician \u2014 in this case, tech bros, who often position themselves as apart from career politicians and fancy themselves as forward thinkers \u2014 can perpetuate positions on race issues that are dismissive, corrosive and backward?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ramaswamy and Yang certainly aren\u2019t the only examples.

This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Republican Party that he has supported cares, and it is engaged in a relentless campaign of anti-trans legislation in states across the country. Thiel is also an author of the 1995 book \u201cThe Diversity Myth,\u201d which argued against \u201cthe extreme focus on racism.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the moment, perhaps the highest-profile political tech bro is Elon Musk, who styled himself as a free-speech champion when he bought Twitter but appears to use the site mostly as a soapbox to make his views explicit. He has tweeted about \u201cowning the libs,\u201d encouraged people to vote Republican in last year\u2019s midterms and mocked shirts with \u201c#StayWoke\u201d printed on them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Success in the tech sector has lent all of these guys an undeserved gravitas and a gloss as unconventional businessmen.

Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) and his Republican counterpart, Everett Dirksen (Ill.), introduced the bill, and the final legislation enjoyed more support from Republican than Democratic members, an almost unthinkable dynamic today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even after the divisive impact of the so-called \"Gingrich Revolution\" when Congress was truly tested, we were able to rise to the occasion. In 1996, in the midst of a wave of arsons targeting African American houses of worship, then-Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, a stalwart Republican from Illinois, asked me to work with him on a legislative response. We disagreed on most of the major social issues of the day, from abortion to affirmative action. However, during this crisis we found a way to introduce and pass the Church Arson Prevention Act, which not only gave law enforcement needed prosecutorial tools but also sent a loud and clear signal to the minority community that Congress was willing and able to act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today, at a time of greater polarization and gridlock, Congress is again being challenged. I don't labor under the illusion that Washington has all the answers - we can't do anything to bring back the four individuals who were killed. But there are some common-sense actions Congress can take:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>- First and foremost, at a time when we have more than 2 million individuals in prison - 60 percent of whom are minorities - we need a federal law limiting racial profiling and reducing over- incarceration. Research demonstrates people of color are profiled and arrested at disproportionately higher rates as well as charged with harsher counts and sentenced more severely than whites. We were on the verge of enacting a ban on profiling in 2001 and President George W. Bush called for it in his State of the Union address, but it became politically untenable in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>- Second, we need a fairer system to resolve allegations of police brutality. If the nation has learned anything over the past several weeks, it's that relying on a grand jury system led by local prosecutors is insufficient to protect against police misconduct. That's why I have proposed legislation to strengthen the Justice Department's ability to conduct \"pattern and practice\" investigations and to foster a system of improved standards for federal and state police operations, especially in the areas of accountability and oversight.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>- Third, we need to update the Voting Rights Act - which has been severely undermined by the Supreme Court's recent Shelby County v. Holder decision - so that we can prevent voting discrimination practices before they take effect. One of the lessons of Ferguson is that minority communities that do not believe they have political representation run the risk of becoming alienated from their public officials. It is by now well known that Ferguson, an overwhelmingly African American community, had only three black officers out of 53 on the police force and just one black on the six-person city council. Our nation can and must do better.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the midterm elections, our congressional leaders declared a newfound fidelity to bipartisanship. The recent string of tragedies makes clear that now is the time to convert their words into legislative action. I understand that remaining partisan differences - if not outright anger - have prevented cooperation in the past. However, it's instructive to recall that such differences did not stop conservative President Ronald Reagan from signing the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday bill into law in 1983. Nor did they prevent Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) and Bush from working with me and other Democrats to extend the Voting Rights Act in 2006.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On Jan. 6, I will become the dean of the House of Representatives, and my first responsibility will be to swear in John Boehner as House speaker. Both of us can recall an era when Congress was more capable of responding to a national crisis. It is therefore my hope that we will be able to rekindle that heritage of collaboration and work together toward soothing the racial scars exposed in Missouri, Ohio, Arizona and New York.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The writer, a Democrat, represents Michigan's 13th Congressional District in the House.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: John Conyers Jr.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/1518880363.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Finally getting it right on affirmative action (Posted 2014-04-25 00:29:11)</h2<p>Every once in a while a great, conflicted country gets an insoluble problem exactly right. Such is the Supreme Court's ruling this week on affirmative action. It upheld a Michigan referendum prohibiting the state from discriminating either for or against any citizen on the basis of race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Schuette ruling is highly significant for two reasons: its lopsided majority of 6 to 2, including a crucial concurrence from liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, and, even more important, Breyer's rationale. It couldn't be simpler. \"The Constitution foresees the ballot box, not the courts, as the normal instrument for resolving differences and debates about the merits of these programs.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally. After 36 years since the Bakke case, years of endless pettifoggery -- parsing exactly how many spoonfuls of racial discrimination are permitted in exactly which circumstance -- the court has its epiphany: Let the people decide. Not our business. We will not ban affirmative action. But we will not impose it, as the Schuette plaintiffs would have us do by ruling that no state is permitted to ban affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The path to this happy place has been characteristically crooked. Eleven years ago, the court rejected an attempt to strike down affirmative action at the University of Michigan law school. The 2003 Grutter decision, as I wrote at the time, was \"incoherent, disingenuous, intellectually muddled and morally confused\" -- and exactly what the country needed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The reasoning was a mess because, given the very wording of the equal-protection clause (and of the Civil Rights Act), justifying any kind of racial preference requires absurd, often comical linguistic contortions. As Justice Antonin Scalia put it in his Schuette concurrence, even the question is absurd: \"Does the Equal Protection Clause . . .forbid what its text plainly requires?\" (i.e., colorblindness).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indeed, over these four decades, how was \"equal protection\" transformed into a mandate for race discrimination? By morphing affirmative action into diversity and declaring diversity a state purpose important enough to justify racial preferences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is pretty weak gruel when compared with the social harm inherent in discriminating by race: exacerbating group antagonisms, stigmatizing minority achievement and, as documented by Thomas Sowell, Stuart Taylor and many others, needlessly and tragically damaging promising minority students by turning them disproportionately into failures at institutions for which they are unprepared.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So why did I celebrate the hopelessly muddled Grutter decision, which left affirmative action standing?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because much as I believe the harm of affirmative action outweighs the good, the courts are not the place to decide the question. At its core, affirmative action is an attempt -- noble but terribly flawed, in my view -- at racial restitution. The issue is too neuralgic, the history too troubled, the ramifications too deep to be decided on high by nine robes. As with all great national questions, the only path to an enduring, legitimate resolution is by the democratic process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That was the lesson of Roe v. Wade. It created a great societal rupture because, as Ruth Bader Ginsburg once explained, it \"halted a political process that was moving in a reform direction and thereby, I believe, prolonged divisiveness and deferred stable settlement of the [abortion] issue.\" It is never a good idea to take these profound political questions out of the political arena. (Regrettably, Ginsberg supported the dissent in Schuette, which would have done exactly that to affirmative action, recapitulating Roe.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Which is why the 2003 Grutter decision was right. Asked to abolish affirmative action -- and thus remove it from the democratic process -- the court said no.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The implication? The people should decide.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The people responded accordingly. Three years later, they crafted a referendum to abolish race consciousness in government action. It passed overwhelmingly, 58 percent to 42 percent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Schuette completes the circle by respecting the constitutionality of that democratic decision. As Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the controlling opinion: \"This case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved. It is about who may resolve it.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And as Breyer wrote: \"The Constitution permits, though it does not require . . . race-conscious programs.\" Liberal as he is, Breyer could not accept the radical proposition of the Schuette plaintiffs that the Constitution demands -- and cannot countenance a democratically voted abolition of -- racial preferences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This gives us, finally, the basis for a new national consensus. Two-thirds of the court has just said to the nation: For those of you who wish to continue to judge by race, we'll keep making jesuitical distinctions to keep the discrimination from getting too obvious or outrageous. If, however, you wish to be rid of this baleful legacy and banish race preferences once and for all, do what Michigan did. You have our blessing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>letters@charleskrauthammer.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/421529120.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; Alex Saragoza</h2<p>Ever since the University of California ended affirmative action in 1998, it has struggled to maintain a racially diverse student body. In place of racial preferences, the university has sought to help poor and minority students become better academically prepared in order to compete for seats at one of UC's nine campuses. Showered by millions of dollars from the Legislature, the university has plunged into public schools like never before. Yet, the expanding array of outreach programs--to improve teaching, enrich curriculum, tutor students and get them on the college track--have, so far, shown no significant results.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The numbers of black, Latino and American Indian students remain depressed at UC Berkeley and UCLA, the two most competitive campuses. Across all campuses, these underrepresented minorities have increased slightly, but nothing close to the university's goal of doubling their numbers by 2002.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So when UC's central office began searching for a new leader of its outreach program, \"It was the talk of the town,\" recalls Alex M. Saragoza, a Berkeley ethnic-studies professor. \"We all realized the huge stakes.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Saragoza didn't want the job, however. This son of San Joaquin Valley farm workers who went on to earn a PhD in history was already doing his part: mentoring some students, recruiting others and regularly giving inspirational talks at high schools. He also served on a faculty committee overseeing Berkeley admissions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It wasn't until the search committee came up empty-handed that Saragoza applied at the urging of an old friend on the committee. \"I never thought I'd be a finalist, but I wanted to show them there are a lot of us who care about this important work.\" He got the job as UC's vice president for educational outreach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Saragoza's new post at UC's plush headquarters in Oakland is a long way from the one-room house without indoor plumbing in Madera, Calif., where he grew up speaking only Spanish. Saragoza bootstrapped his way through Cal State Fresno and earned a master's in education at Harvard and his doctorate at UC San Diego in Latin American history. He wants nothing more than to blaze new paths so thousands more poor, minority students can also make it to college.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Saragoza, 53, lives in Martinez, Calif., with Juanita, his high school sweetheart and wife of 30 years, and their 10-year-old daughter, Alejandra. He spoke passionately about the far-reaching changes he hopes to direct from his 12th-floor office overlooking downtown Oakland.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Question: Why did you end up taking the outreach job?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Answer: It's horribly unfair to create a situation where kids like me are more likely to fail than succeed. The system didn't make it easy for me. I'm here mainly because of a constellation of lucky incidents in my life. Education should not be a matter of luck. So I'm giving myself two or three years to see if I can make a difference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: To make a difference, does the university need to figure out how to save the public schools or save a few kids from the schools?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: Our impact on the schools is relatively small. We are actually involved in 7% or 8% of schools in California. So we are not going to save the schools. I see the task as accelerating the promotion of a college-going culture. Often, it's creating a college-going culture for the first time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: What do you mean?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: Let me give you an example. We found a school near UC Santa Cruz where 70% of the sophomores are not on track to become eligible for UC admission. We have to work with these kids to at least get them on track to go to community college, so we can monitor them and get them to transfer later to UC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kenneth R. Weiss covers higher education for The Times.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: You talk about community colleges. But the UC regents and others have focused almost exclusively on increasing minorities as UC freshmen.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: The criteria for our success is based on getting kids to go to college. If that's UC, then great. If it's a [Cal State University] campus, we'll try to pick them up when they are ready for graduate school. I have no problem if someone ends up going to Cal State. If it's the community college, we'll try to get them to transfer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: So you plan to focus on community colleges as a way to get more underrepresented minorities to UC?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: The community colleges are in many ways better poised to get them into the college-going track than we are. We also need to focus more on the rural areas of California, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley. . . . About 30 community colleges produce about two- thirds of the UC transfer students. If you look at which community colleges send us students, they are not in the San Joaquin Valley. We have to reach out to those poor rural areas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: Under your predecessor, Karl Pister, much of the focus was on schools in Los Angeles County, which produces nearly half of the black and Latino high school graduates in California. Are you thinking of pulling back from that effort?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: No. It's not an issue of withdrawing resources, but balancing them with other areas. [My] Rural Schools Initiative [intends] to allocate new resources to rural areas. The San Joaquin Valley will be the pilot for this program. Rural areas face special problems. UC recruiters in Fresno have to drive two hours to a high school, and rural schools have relatively few resources and often have a high proportion of poor students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: Are there other areas that deserve special attention?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: I'm particularly concerned with the suburbanization of poverty. What we have is the flight of middle-income folks to edge communities, people who travel from the Bay Area to Tracy or Modesto to find affordable housing. In Southern California, people are commuting from Santa Clarita to L.A. This has happened so quickly that agrarian communities are surrounded by this moat of suburbanites. So you have the shiny new elementary school in the suburban area, and the other school remains what it was before: decrepit and dilapidated. What you have is a greater isolation of poor kids, and they have become even more marginalized.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: How do you decide how broadly or narrowly to focus your efforts, given that you only have so much money? You don't want to abandon students in some areas, but if you spread yourself too thin, will you be able to help anyone?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: That's one of my challenges. We need new resources, and we have to have the cooperation of the people involved. The University of California cannot do it alone. We need the help of our partners, the K-12 schools, the CSUs and the community colleges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: Hasn't there been some tension among these other segments?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: These partners have long resented the way UC has handled some of its outreach programs. The notion that we come in and tell a school: If you follow this recipe, we will turn your school around. We need to improve our connection and not take the attitude that we are know-it-alls. We have to work better with the public schools, the CSUs and the community colleges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: Are there other things you have picked up that need special examination?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: I want to look at the disparity between the number of females and males on track for college. It's one of those things that people don't want to talk about. But we need to find out what's going on there. Maybe it's a teenage-boy thing. Does it have anything to do with the embedded sexism in the K-12 system, where the overwhelming number of teachers are females? Is it a role-model thing? The gap is already there among African Americans going to college. It seems to be widening. It's happening to Latinos. We need to look at it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: Some legislative aides think that UC is setting itself up for failure by claiming it's spending $250 million a year on outreach-- as a way to impress folks that it's doing something. That figure, in their view, is creative accounting, because it includes matching funds from K-12 schools and money passed through to programs run exclusively by community colleges. Do you see that inflated figure as a setup, especially when the Legislature wants to know what it's getting for its money?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: I know the perception is that we have this huge pot of money. Of course, that's not the case. It involves all those other actors. I'm less concerned about the money than about results, whether it be in improving teaching, getting more of our kids into UC or increasing our number of community-college transfers. If I can show we are successful with hard data, then the money issue becomes less important.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: The UC Outreach Task Force in 1997 gave the university five years to double the number of underrepresented minorities who meet minimum eligibility requirements and increase by 50% those who are competitively eligible to compete for seats at places like UCLA and UC Berkeley. Are these realistic goals?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: I think there was a lot of wishful thinking in developing those goals. I don't think people realized how bad our relationship was with community colleges. I don't think people understood the difficulty of the task or were talking to the people who do the work. What does graduating from high school mean in terms of getting into UC? A lot of these kids who graduate from these schools are horribly underprepared. It would be like it was when I got to Berkeley in 1979. We had a revolving door. We were bringing the kids in. \"Hey, man, look, we've got 200 more Chicano students here.\" But who was there two years later? Literally half of them were gone. That's why we expanded the Learning Center at Berkeley to address the problem of underpreparation. We need to do the same thing in our academic outreach programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: You are talking as if you prefer the outreach program to affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: Would I prefer it? Well, no. In the best of circumstances, you would have both things working together. If we had affirmative action, with the kinds of resources we are putting into the effort to get students on track for college, it would be an incredible success.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: But without affirmative action, are the goals of doubling the number of underrepresented minorities realistic?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: Whether or not the goals are realistic, I'll have a better way of answering that after [today's] meeting of admissions directors. I will plead my case for a variety of changes at that meeting.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: What kind of changes?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: We need to give credit to students who have been successfully involved in our Early Academic Outreach Program. If we are going to give AP courses one [extra grade] point, I would argue that EAOP activities count for at least half a point. If we don't, then why in the heck are we spending all this money? What is the payoff for a student who is going to a school with very few AP courses?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Q: How long do you think you'll have a honeymoon in this job?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A: I have, at best, a one-year window, and it terrifies me. This is not a new effort. I think the Legislature and the governor's office are going to want results.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Message No: ..ACCN: 00066690</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Caption: GRAPHIC-DRAWING: UC's Czar of Minority Outreach Faces Falling Admissions, Great Expectations; PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER: ROBERT DURRELL / Los Angeles Times</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2831119353.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>This is the end of Republican moderation on race in higher education</h2<p>For the second time in as many terms, the Supreme Court has disrupted a constitutional doctrine that it had initially forged in the mid-1970s and reaffirmed in the face of challenges from the right just a couple of decades ago.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Last year, the court repudiated Roe v. Wade</p>\n<p>, which legalized abortion in 1973 and which the court upheld in 1992 in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Now, the court has overturned admissions policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina that relied on precedents permitting schools to consider the race of applicants from underrepresented groups, for the sake of diversity: the Bakke case in 1978 and Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These past cases were the handiwork of moderate Republican-appointed justices. Roe's author, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, was elevated to the court by President Richard M. Nixon, as were two others in the seven-justice majority that joined his opinion. (Another moderate justice who voted in favor of Roe, Potter Stewart, was named to the court by Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower.) The three-justice bloc that helped preserve Roe's essential holding in Casey consisted of Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and David Souter, appointed by President George H.W. Bush.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1978, it was Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., another Nixon appointee, who wrote the controlling opinion in Bakke that authorized schools to use race as a \"plus factor\" while assembling a diverse student body \u2014 but only via \"holistic\" individual evaluations, not numerical quotas. Twenty-five years later, in Grutter, O'Connor cast a majority-making fifth vote in favor of Powell's view and wrote an opinion based on it for the court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the court announced that decision, President George W. Bush said it struck a \"careful balance between the goal of campus diversity and the fundamental principle of equal treatment under the law.\" His Republican administration had been internally divided between conservatives who favored \"color-blind\" admissions and senior Black officials, such as Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, who wanted to preserve affirmative action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One way to read this half-century of history: There are no more Republican-appointed moderates on the court, at least not of the Powell-O'Connor variety, and not too many moderate Republicans anywhere else, either.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet even those who regret what a six-justice conservative majority did on Thursday must acknowledge that the Bakke-Grutter doctrine gave them plenty to work with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The interest in diversity Bakke and Grutter recognized was an unavoidably amorphous one, more about shaping campus conversation than making up for historical injustice inflicted on Black people. In the zero-sum admissions competition, how can race be a plus-factor for some without being a minus for other meritorious candidates, including, as the organization that sued Harvard and the University of North Carolina emphasized, Asian Americans \u2014 a group that has also experienced official discrimination?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remedying past discrimination would have been a far clearer, more historically honest, rationale for race-conscious admissions, as Thurgood Marshall argued in his Bakke opinion. In hindsight, it might also have been easier to time-limit such a policy, because the case for race-conscious admissions would arguably diminish as the social position of its intended beneficiaries measurably improved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To be sure, the political culture has treated affirmative action as a racial justice policy, part of what is now a movement for \"diversity, equity and inclusion,\" just as Roe came to symbolize women's autonomy and reproductive rights even though the actual opinion turned on privacy rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And yet that is not quite what the justices who wrote Bakke and Grutter envisioned. A White Virginian struggling with the true legacy of his state's history, Lewis Powell balked at such strong medicine for \"societal discrimination,\" and fretted over the unfairness \"quotas\" might do to \"innocent\" people like White medical school applicant Allan Bakke. O'Connor's Grutter opinion channeled Powell's good intentions but also his ambivalence. She said race-conscious admissions were a necessary but also potentially \"dangerous\" measure, whose phasing out after 25 years would be reasonable to \"expect.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In his opinion for the court on Thursday, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. invoked these two justices' qualifications and reservations in his opinion striking down the Harvard and University of North Carolina policies \u2014 implying that it was possible to do so without expressly overruling Bakke or Grutter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The ruling lands in a far less bipartisan political era than the ones that produced the court's affirmative action compromises. A backlash like the one that greeted last June's Dobbs abortion ruling is unlikely, though; whereas a clear majority of Americans supports legal abortion, the latest Pew Research Center poll shows respondents disapproving of race-conscious admissions 50 percent to 33 percent, with significant minorities of Black and Latino people among those opposed. An AP-NORC poll showed two-thirds of adults did not want the court to \"prohibit\" race-conscious admissions \u2014 but only 31 percent think race should be \"important\" to admissions. (More than twice that percentage called grades and test scores \"important.\") The moderate Powell-O'Connor legacy might be gone. The mixed feelings the two justices expressed remain.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/398722399.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>Remember When Al Gore Was a Moderate?</h2<p>Al Gore may have roused the faithful with his startlingly lifelike performance last week, but for many of us lapsed Democrats the convention only confirmed the depressing truth that in today's Democratic Party no one fails the ideological litmus tests and survives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That was most evident, of course, in Joe Lieberman's rush to disavow precisely those positions that made him attractive to centrists in the first place. Yet there's been so much attention devoted to the sorry spectacle of Mr. Lieberman slavishly kowtowing to the likes of Maxine Waters that it's easy to forget Mr. Gore once had to travel nearly the same road.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Much of the world first became aware of Mr. Gore around 15 years ago when he rallied behind Tipper's campaign for the labeling of offensive lyrics. While orthodox liberals ritualistically denounced the campaign as an assault on free speech, many of us with young kids welcomed the effort as the plea for simple sanity it was.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Indeed, as one of those longtime Democrats increasingly dubious about the political faith I'd embraced since childhood, I interviewed Mrs. Gore at the time for a New York Times Magazine piece aimed at answering a nagging question: Why was it that we Democrats had surrendered the \"values issues\" to the Republicans?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reporting the piece proved an eye-opener in a couple of ways. First, to my amazement, far from being the vicious, narrow-minded zealots I expected, the Reagan people with whom I spoke were impressively thoughtful -- far closer to where I was on these issues than were the New York journalists in my circle. But, too, there was the appalling power of the narrow-minded zealots on the other side, confidently making pariahs of even longtime, committed Democrats who dared stray from prevailing orthodoxy on abortion or affirmative action or even day care.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mrs. Gore was among those who found this deeply disheartening. \"All we're saying,\" she noted plaintively, \"is let's look at what we're doing to our children; for heaven's sake, let's look at what we're doing to ourselves. Is that really so unreasonable?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But for many of those arrayed against her, she was not just wrong but evil. \"As far as I'm concerned,\" record mogul and Hollywood Democratic honcho Danny Goldberg told me, \"she's another McCarthy, an agent for the far right. . . . She's married to a Southern Democrat who thinks it's a good way to appeal to Southern bigots.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Harrowing as such a reaction was, it represented a significant and powerful segment of the party that had to be appeased, as Mr. Gore learned in his abortive presidential run three years later. Casting himself as the moderate -- strong on national defense, eminently reasonable on abortion and race -- in a field dominated by Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, he appealed to some of us looking for reasons to stay in the fold. He got creamed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As Mr. Clinton's running mate, and in the years that followed, Mr. Gore has so fully transformed himself that by now he's all but obliterated memories of his earlier self. Throughout the '90s -- indeed, until the convention, when recalling it was again useful -- both Gores treated Tipper's antiobscenity crusade as a long-ago embarrassment to be lived down. They have genuflected to Hollywood with all the zeal (if not style) of Mr. Clinton himself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Never mind principle. In his rush to be remade Mr. Gore was a man ready to abandon basic common sense. He'd gone gung-ho for \"a woman's right to choose\" (including partial-birth abortion), as he declared to Tim Russert a few weeks back, because he'd \"talked to women\" and been \"educated.\" Which women would those be? Kate Michelman? Gloria Steinem? Surely not many women back in Tennessee where, even more than elsewhere, sentiment is overwhelmingly against abortion on demand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So why is anyone surprised we now find Joe Lieberman behaving the same way? Because we'd come to think of Mr. Lieberman as a different kind of Democrat, more independent-minded and honorable than the rest. And so, maybe, to a degree, he'll remain -- in the most private recesses of his heart. But on the campaign trail in weeks to come, arm-in-arm with multiculturalists and teachers-union activists and feminist absolutists, you can bet he'll only expand on his rethought positions on racial preferences, Social Security and the implications of Clintonian misbehavior.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This will not be of much interest to a compliant media. But if properly understood and exploited, it offers the Bush team an opportunity of immense size.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In recent years, we have heard endlessly about the ayatollahs of the right who would impose their narrow morality on the rest of us. Yet the truth is that the most dangerous ideologues these days are on the left, for they wield institutional power far out of proportion to their numbers. It is they who have turned the teaching of American history in the nation's schools into little more than an endless litany of victims and victimizers, and promulgated regulations on sexual harassment that have chilled relations between the sexes from office towers to military bases. They, via ham-handed affirmative-action programs, have turned upside down the very meaning of fairness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Along the way they have sought to stifle dissent by using \"racism,\" \"sexism\" and \"homophobia\" as clubs to beat down those with legitimate policy differences. Need we be told that in progressive circles these days, to so much as question, say, the propriety of gay marriage is to risk being stigmatized as a bigot?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the national level Mr. Gore has come to epitomize this bullying approach to civic life. In Ward Connerly's recent book, \"Creating Equal,\" the black anti-affirmative action crusader describes the White House meeting he and other conservatives had a couple of years ago with the president and vice president in connection with the Clinton initiative on race. Mr. Connerly notes that while Mr. Clinton was charming and at least made a pretense of sympathy for their concerns, Mr. Gore was hostile to the point of rudeness. When the gathering concluded, he writes, Mr. Gore took his hand, \"but instead of shaking it, he ground my palm and fingers in his grip hard as he could. I felt the cartilage compress and almost cried out in pain. I looked at the vice president and he stared back at me with a slight smile as we walked out.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is the sort of episode that, if known, would rightly offend most decent and thoughtful Americans. As a people, we are deeply divided about many things, but we tend to share a powerful aversion to bullies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And within the Democratic Party, on the key social issues, the bullies have come to wield absolute power -- not just over what it is permissible to believe but over how it gets translated into policy. Mr. Lieberman knows this as well as Mr. Gore.

{"id": "txt/2213553821.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>End College Legacy Preferences</h2<p>SOMEONE reading about the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding Michigan\u2019s ban on affirmative action \u2014 and by extension similar measures passed by voters in California, Texas, Florida and Washington \u2014 might develop the misimpression that affirmative action is on the wane. In fact, it\u2019s alive and well: Public and private colleges routinely give preferential treatment to children of alumni.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you have kids, or plan on having them someday, you know that acceptance rates at elite colleges are at historic lows. Stanford led the stingy pack, admitting but 5 percent of applicants, with Harvard and Yale trailing close behind at 5.9 percent and 6.3 percent respectively.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For \u201clegacies,\u201d the picture isn\u2019t nearly so bleak. Reviewing admission data from 30 top colleges in the Economics of Education Review, the researcher Michael Hurwitz concluded that children of alumni had a 45 percent greater chance of admission. A Princeton team found the advantage to be worth the equivalent of 160 additional points on an applicant\u2019s SAT, nearly as much as being a star athlete or African-American or Hispanic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At Harvard, my alma mater, the legacy acceptance rate is 30 percent, which is not an unusual number at elite colleges. That\u2019s roughly five times the overall rate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The disparity is so great it makes the most sense to conceptualize college applications to elite colleges as two separate competitions: one for children whose parents are legacies, the other for children whose parents aren\u2019t.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Admissions officers will hasten to tell you that in a meritocracy many legacies would get in anyway. Let\u2019s pause to consider the usefulness of the term \u201cmeritocracy\u201d in a system where the deck is stacked at every level in favor of rich, white students before conceding the premise. It\u2019s surely true that many children of alumni are brilliant, hard-working and deserving of a seat at a top college. That\u2019s quite different from saying the system is fair. In 2003, Harvard\u2019s admissions dean said that the SAT scores of legacy admits were \u201cjust two points below the school\u2019s overall average.\u201d These are students who have enjoyed a lifetime of advantage. We\u2019d expect them to have outperformed nonlegacies, at least by a bit, and yet they\u2019ve done slightly worse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reasonable minds can differ on the morality and wisdom of race-based affirmative action. Where I teach, at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which is about as egalitarian as institutions come, I\u2019ve seen firsthand what the data show: College is a ticket out of poverty, and exposing young men and women to diverse classmates and role models raises the ceiling on what they believe is possible for themselves. That said, I acknowledge the desire for a colorblind, meritocratic society as an honorable position. But how can anyone defend making an exception for children of alumni?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One needn\u2019t have a dog in this hunt to be troubled by legacy. It\u2019s disastrous public policy. Because of legacy admissions, elite colleges look almost nothing like America. Consider these facts: To be a 1 percenter, a family needs an annual income of approximately $390,000. When the Harvard Crimson surveyed this year\u2019s freshman class, 14 percent of respondents reported annual family income above $500,000. Another 15 percent came from families making more than $250,000 per year. Only 20 percent reported incomes less than $65,000. This is the amount below which Harvard will allow a student to go free of charge. It\u2019s also just above the national median family income. So, at least as many Harvard students come from families in the top 1 percent as the bottom 50 percent. Of course this says nothing of middle-class families, for whom private college is now essentially unaffordable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These facts will trouble any parent of modest means, but it\u2019s time to recognize this as an American problem. Together with environmental destruction, social inequality is the defining failure of our generation. The richest .01 percent of American families possess 11.1 percent of the national wealth, but 22 percent of American children live in poverty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are only two ways this gets better. One is a huge reformation of the tax structure. The other is improved access to higher education. Few investments yield a greater return than a college degree. Education has great potential to combat inequality, but progress simply isn\u2019t possible if legacy persists.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To justify this practice there would need to be, in lawyer language, a compelling justification. There is none. Elite colleges defend legacy as necessary to fund-raising. It isn\u2019t. Neither Oxford nor Cambridge nor M.I.T. considers legacy. Their prestige is intact, they attract great students, and they have ample endowments. Moreover, technology has transformed fund-raising. Presidential candidates raise money through grass-roots campaigns; colleges can, too.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Legacy evolved largely as a doctrine to legitimize the exclusion of Jews from elite schools. It endures today as a mechanism for reinforcing inequality, with particularly harsh consequences for Asians, and fundamentally contradicts the rhetoric of access in which elite colleges routinely engage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and Columbia collectively have endowments of about $100 billion. They have the means to end this abhorrent practice with a stroke of a pen and the financial resources to endure whatever uncertainty ensues. Just a hunch, but I think the economically diverse students admitted to these great colleges would be successful and generous to their alma maters, not in the hope of securing their child a place in a class, but out of genuine appreciation of a legacy of equal access.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Evan J.

{"id": "txt/2122889176.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Curse of Affirmative Action</h2<p>Of all the names I\u2019ve been called in life, including the usual anti-Semitic slurs, none has more sting than \u201caffirmative action hire.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I got that a lot on social media after I joined The Times. The meaning was clear: I was a quota-filler who had taken the place of somebody more deserving. Whatever I had accomplished, through talent or hard work, wasn\u2019t enough. I was just fulfilling a misbegotten mandate for ideological diversity \u2014 and doing even that poorly, since, like every other columnist here, I\u2019m also a Trump opponent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The accusation always came from the left, and it contained an implicit admission. The very people who ordinarily championed affirmative action as a cornerstone of a decent society \u2014 for giving a needed leg up to the systemically disadvantaged \u2014 had no trouble understanding the other dimension of the policy \u2014 an unfair preference for the unqualified. They knew that \u201caffirmative action,\u201d whatever its benefits as a form of social engineering, was a synonym for mediocrity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They also knew the insult\u2019s insidious psychological power to wound. To be told that you are an affirmative action hire shakes the ground under your feet. Am I being humored? Have I always been? Is coming to The Times a mark of professional merit, or is my job a polite fiction, one that everyone but me sees through?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I mention this as the most significant legal battle over affirmative action in recent years unfolds in a Boston courtroom. In Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, a federal judge is considering whether Harvard University has violated the civil rights of Asian-Americans by using vague measures of personality to hold down their chances of admission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Evidence : An internal Harvard document from 2013 found that, based on admissions criteria that considered academic performance only, Asian-Americans would account for 43 percent of the admitted class. But their actual admission rate was 19 percent then and has risen to only 23 percent since.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Evidence: An analysis commissioned by the plaintiffs of student records found that the Harvard Admissions Office consistently rated Asian-Americans lower on personality traits such as \u201clikability\u201d and \u201ckindness,\u201d even when they hadn\u2019t met with them in person. By contrast, alumni interviewers, who did meet the applicants, often rated them highly on personality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Evidence: annual meetings of the Association of Black Admissions and Financial Aid Officers of the Ivy League and Sister Schools, or Abafaoilss, in which conferees share information about the race of their admitted and matriculated students. The Supreme Court has allowed race to be a consideration in admissions, while forbidding the kind of explicit racial balancing that seemed to be the purpose of the meetings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All this confirms what most thoughtful people should know already about affirmative action: that what is supposed to be a powerful method for inclusion is an equally powerful method of exclusion. If you\u2019re going to say yes to Jack, you\u2019ll have to say no to Jill. The world of college admissions is a fixed pie.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What distinguishes the Harvard suit from past legal challenges to affirmative action is that it shows that the people the policy harms aren\u2019t privileged and unsympathetic white kids. The injured are other minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nor is this a matter of second-tier white students duking it out for the last available slots against standout minorities. The Asian-Americans rejected by Harvard are outstanding candidates being penalized by hoary stereotypes about having ferocious work ethics but not much else. Internal Harvard documents refer to them as \u201cbusy and bright\u201d and \u201cstandard strong\u201d \u2014 reminiscent of the way a previous generation of Jewish students were dismissed as \u201caverage geniuses\u201d who were not \u201cclubbable.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No wonder Harvard fought tooth-and-nail to keep those documents secret. The goal of achieving a desired racial composition on campus depends on Wizard of Oz-like schemes of dissembling and doublethink. The core problem with every noble lie is that it can only be concealed by an additional lie, then another. Whatever else it is, it\u2019s the opposite of Veritas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, I can\u2019t help but think that critics of the plaintiffs are right in at least one respect: Those \u201cbusy and bright\u201d kids who aren\u2019t going to Harvard will be fine. Most will still get into great schools and have good careers. They might rage against an institution that turned them away unfairly. Yet deep down they\u2019ll have the satisfaction of knowing their own worth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Will that be equally true of those who, thanks to affirmative action, did get in? I wonder. Perhaps the deepest damage affirmative action does is to those it embraces, not those it rejects. It isn\u2019t a pleasant thing to live with the sense that your achievements aren\u2019t quite real\u2014 and that everyone secretly knows it. It\u2019s corrosive to live in the clutch of someone else\u2019s lie.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\u201d John Roberts once wrote. Should this case reach the Supreme Court, let\u2019s hope he still means it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: Bret Stephens</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/2221341477.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>The Terrorist Barack Hussein Obama</h2<p>IF you think way back to the start of this marathon campaign, back when it seemed preposterous that any black man could be a serious presidential contender, then you remember the biggest fear about Barack Obama: a crazy person might take a shot at him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some voters told reporters that they didn\u2019t want Obama to run, let alone win, should his very presence unleash the demons who have stalked America from Lincoln to King. After consultation with Congress, Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, gave Obama a Secret Service detail earlier than any presidential candidate in our history \u0097 in May 2007, some eight months before the first Democratic primaries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the best protection in the world, so stop worrying,\u201d Obama reassured his supporters. Eventually the country got conditioned to his appearing in large arenas without incident (though I confess that the first loud burst of fireworks at the end of his convention stadium speech gave me a start). In America, nothing does succeed like success. The fear receded.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Until now. At McCain-Palin rallies, the raucous and insistent cries of \u201cTreason!\u201d and \u201cTerrorist!\u201d and \u201cKill him!\u201d and \u201cOff with his head!\u201d as well as the uninhibited slinging of racial epithets, are actually something new in a campaign that has seen almost every conceivable twist. They are alarms. Doing nothing is not an option.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All\u2019s fair in politics. John McCain and Sarah Palin have every right to bring up William Ayers, even if his connection to Obama is minor, even if Ayers\u2019s Weather Underground history dates back to Obama\u2019s childhood, even if establishment Republicans and Democrats alike have collaborated with the present-day Ayers in educational reform. But it\u2019s not just the old Joe McCarthyesque guilt-by-association game, however spurious, that\u2019s going on here. Don\u2019t for an instant believe the many mindlessly \u201ceven-handed\u201d journalists who keep saying that the McCain campaign\u2019s use of Ayers is the moral or political equivalent of the Obama campaign\u2019s hammering on Charles Keating.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What makes them different, and what has pumped up the Weimar-like rage at McCain-Palin rallies, is the violent escalation in rhetoric, especially (though not exclusively) by Palin. Obama \u201claunched his political career in the living room of a domestic terrorist.\u201d He is \u201cpalling around with terrorists\u201d (note the plural noun). Obama is \u201cnot a man who sees America the way you and I see America.\u201d Wielding a wildly out-of-context Obama quote, Palin slurs him as an enemy of American troops.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By the time McCain asks the crowd \u201cWho is the real Barack Obama?\u201d it\u2019s no surprise that someone cries out \u201cTerrorist!\u201d The rhetorical conflation of Obama with terrorism is complete. It is stoked further by the repeated invocation of Obama\u2019s middle name by surrogates introducing McCain and Palin at these rallies. This sleight of hand at once synchronizes with the poisonous Obama-is-a-Muslim e-mail blasts and shifts the brand of terrorism from Ayers\u2019s Vietnam-era variety to the radical Islamic threats of today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That\u2019s a far cry from simply accusing Obama of being a guilty-by-association radical leftist. Obama is being branded as a potential killer and an accessory to past attempts at murder. \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s friend tried to kill my family\u201d was how a McCain press release last week packaged the remembrance of a Weather Underground incident from 1970 \u0097 when Obama was 8.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We all know what punishment fits the crime of murder, or even potential murder, if the security of post-9/11 America is at stake. We all know how self-appointed \u201cpatriotic\u201d martyrs always justify taking the law into their own hands.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Obama can hardly be held accountable for Ayers\u2019s behavior 40 years ago, but at least McCain and Palin can try to take some responsibility for the behavior of their own supporters in 2008. What\u2019s troubling here is not only the candidates\u2019 loose inflammatory talk but also their refusal to step in promptly and strongly when someone responds to it with bloodthirsty threats in a crowded arena. Joe Biden had it exactly right when he expressed concern last week that \u201ca leading American politician who might be vice president of the United States would not just stop midsentence and turn and condemn that.\u201d To stay silent is to pour gas on the fires.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t always thus with McCain. In February he loudly disassociated himself from a speaker who brayed \u201cBarack Hussein Obama\u201d when introducing him at a rally in Ohio. Now McCain either backpedals with tardy, pro forma expressions of respect for his opponent or lets second-tier campaign underlings release boilerplate disavowals after ugly incidents like the chilling Jim Crow-era flashback last week when a Florida sheriff ranted about \u201cBarack Hussein Obama\u201d at a Palin rally while in full uniform.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From the start, there have always been two separate but equal questions about race in this election. Is there still enough racism in America to prevent a black man from being elected president no matter what? And, will Republicans play the race card? The jury is out on the first question until Nov. 4. But we now have the unambiguous answer to the second: Yes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>McCain, who is no racist, turned to this desperate strategy only as Obama started to pull ahead. The tone was set at the Republican convention, with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s mocking dismissal of Obama as an \u201conly in America\u201d affirmative-action baby. We also learned then that the McCain campaign had recruited as a Palin handler none other than Tucker Eskew, the South Carolina consultant who had worked for George W. Bush in the notorious 2000 G.O.P. primary battle where the McCains and their adopted Bangladeshi daughter were slimed by vicious racist rumors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>No less disconcerting was a still-unexplained passage of Palin\u2019s convention speech: Her use of an unattributed quote praising small-town America (as opposed to, say, Chicago and its community organizers) from Westbrook Pegler, the mid-century Hearst columnist famous for his anti-Semitism, racism and violent rhetorical excess. After an assassin tried to kill F.D.R. at a Florida rally and murdered Chicago\u2019s mayor instead in 1933, Pegler wrote that it was \u201cregrettable that Giuseppe Zangara shot the wrong man.\u201d In the \u201960s, Pegler had a wish for Bobby Kennedy: \u201cSome white patriot of the Southern tier will spatter his spoonful of brains in public premises before the snow falls.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is the writer who found his way into a speech by a potential vice president at a national political convention. It\u2019s astonishing there\u2019s been no demand for a public accounting from the McCain campaign. Imagine if Obama had quoted a Black Panther or Louis Farrakhan \u0097 or William Ayers \u0097 in Denver.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The operatives who would have Palin quote Pegler have been at it ever since. A key indicator came two weeks after the convention, when the McCain campaign ran its first ad tying Obama to the mortgage giant Fannie Mae. Rather than make its case by using a legitimate link between Fannie and Obama (or other Democratic leaders), the McCain forces chose a former Fannie executive who had no real tie to Obama or his campaign but did have a black face that could dominate the ad\u2019s visuals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are no black faces high in the McCain hierarchy to object to these tactics. There hasn\u2019t been a single black Republican governor, senator or House member in six years. This is a campaign where Palin can repeatedly declare that Alaska is \u201ca microcosm of America\u201d without anyone even wondering how that might be so for a state whose tiny black and Hispanic populations are each roughly one-third the national average. There are indeed so few people of color at McCain events that a black senior writer from The Tallahassee Democrat was mistakenly ejected by the Secret Service from a campaign rally in Panama City in August, even though he was standing with other reporters and showed his credentials. His only apparent infraction was to look glaringly out of place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Could the old racial politics still be determinative? I\u2019ve long been skeptical of the incessant press prognostications (and liberal panic) that this election will be decided by racist white men in the Rust Belt. Now even the dimmest bloviators have figured out that Americans are riveted by the color green, not black \u0097 as in money, not energy. Voters are looking for a leader who might help rescue them, not a reckless gambler whose lurching responses to the economic meltdown (a campaign \u201csuspension,\u201d a mortgage-buyout stunt that changes daily) are as unhinged as his wanderings around the debate stage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To see how fast the tide is moving, just look at North Carolina. On July 4 this year \u0097 the day that the godfather of modern G.O.P. racial politics, Jesse Helms, died \u0097 The Charlotte Observer reported that strategists of both parties agreed Obama\u2019s chances to win the state fell \u201cbetween slim and none.\u201d Today, as Charlotte reels from the implosion of Wachovia, the McCain-Obama race is a dead heat in North Carolina and Helms\u2019s Republican successor in the Senate, Elizabeth Dole, is looking like a goner.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But we\u2019re not at Election Day yet, and if voters are to have their final say, both America and Obama have to get there safely. The McCain campaign has crossed the line between tough negative campaigning and inciting vigilantism, and each day the mob howls louder. The onus is on the man who says he puts his country first to call off the dogs, pit bulls and otherwise.</p>\n"}

The result: a flash of insight into one of America's touchiest social debates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"You know what you wrote, of course,\" Chinn told me the other day. \"Now recall the Krauthammer piece about the structural responses to the needs of people who use wheelchairs. Aside from stairs, he said, there are two basic ways to bridge elevations: ramps and lifts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Lifts, the usual choice, are off-the-shelf items that a contractor can bolt into place and have done with it. But then he described the cumbersome, creaky, humiliating process of being hauled up and down like freight.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Krauthammer, who has used a wheelchair most of his adult life, was practically lyrical as he described a recent experience at the Kennedy Center Concert Hall.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Every possible elevation -- to orchestra, boxes, even the stage -- is ramped, but given that the Concert Hall floor is one big inclined plane anyway, the effect appears perfectly natural. So natural, in fact, that on opening night, the ramps were as crowded with able-bodied patrons as were the stairs. . . .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"For the disabled, the new Concert Hall is a marvel: You go in on your own, you go out on your own: no one to ask, no one to thank, nothing to do but, like everyone else, enjoy.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now listen to Ed Chinn, who works in low-income and minority communities across the country for Gateway Ministries:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Why is it that, as a nation facing the very real need to bridge certain structural elevations -- economic and social as well as physical -- we have a tendency to build lifts rather than ramps?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He was, as you've guessed, talking about affirmative action -- but also about a lot more than that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Why, for example, seeing the need to bridge elevations for those trapped at the bottom of the economic staircase, have we so often ended up with clunkers like the high-rise public housing complexes of the '50s and '60s or the more recent menu of family assistance programs which have a way of driving fathers away from their children? Why is it that government agencies and departments -- whether predominantly liberal or predominantly conservative -- gravitate toward lifts?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Chinn embraces Krauthammer's preference for accommodations that do not draw needless attention to the incapacities of the intended beneficiaries. But there is, he says, another salient difference between lifts and ramps: \"A ramp may compensate for certain incapacities, but it also requires capacities. Indeed, if the capacities of the one utilizing a ramp aren't brought actively into play, the thing won't work. But because it requires capacity, because it requires the beneficiaries to be a part of the process, it helps them retain their dignity.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Chinn knows that the lift/ramp paradigm is not a policy design, not a set of answers for addressing disability or other disadvantages -- merely a helpful way of thinking about these things.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"It may not even settle all the arguments about which policies are ramps and which lifts,\" he said. Still, it may help explain why the more policies are seen as helping disadvantaged people to advance themselves -- the more they look like ramps -- the greater the public support; the closer a policy comes to awarding places or promotions on the basis of the disadvantage -- lifts -- the greater the public resistance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One problem with Chinn's paradigm is the one Krauthammer himself noted: Ramps can become crowded with competition from the able-bodied. That is, policies intended to help people with special needs may end up attracting those who have no need of special help -- and the subtler the policy, the greater the likelihood of displacement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Says Chinn: \"Maybe that's just something we'll have to learn to tolerate. We've got to tolerate something. Why not competition, rather than those clunky social-policy lifts that make spectacles of people who need help?\"</p>\n"}

Last term, the justices avoided a definitive ruling about affirmative action at the University of Texas at Austin and sent the case back to the lower courts for further review under a new, tougher standard. This week's case, Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, is a second chance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At issue is whether voters can amend a state constitution to ban racial preferences by referendum, as Michigan voters did by 58%-42% in 2006. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals struck the measure down by an 8-7 vote in 2012, arguing that the amendment introduces an extra political hurdle for minorities. Whereas alumni can lobby the University of Michigan to strengthen legacy preferences for their children, the Sixth Circuit said, minority parents would need to amend the constitution to get racial preferences reinstated. \"Such a comparative structural burden undermines the Equal Protection Clause's guarantee that all citizens ought to have equal access to the tools of political change,\" the court said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most observers expect the Supreme Court to reverse the Sixth Circuit because the case involves the ability to advocate for special (i.e., unequal) preferences, not for equal treatment under the law. The Michigan ban on racial preferences states in part that public colleges and universities \"shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.\" As Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette argued in his brief to the court: \"It is curious to say that a law that bars a state from discriminating on the basis of race or sex violates the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating on the basis of race and sex.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The legal briefs of both sides show the case will also inevitably touch on the merits of affirmative-action policies. In particular, the justices may be required to evaluate race-neutral alternatives to affirmative action that disproportionately benefit minorities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although minority voters cannot easily lobby to reinstate racial preferences in Michigan, they remain free to lobby for race-neutral programs that assist many minority students. These would include programs that help low-income students of all races -- programs for more generous financial aid; for more community college transfers to the main campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor; for an end to legacy preferences that disproportionately benefit white students; and for admitting students in the top of every high school class in the state.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Do these alternatives address minority interests? Most certainly. A study I conducted with my Century Foundation colleague Halley Potter found that at seven of 10 leading public universities where race was dropped in admissions, race-neutral strategies yielded comparable or even greater levels of African-American and Latino representation. Supporters of racial preferences note that the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor was one of the three exceptions, and it's true that black enrollment has fallen to 5% in 2012 from 7% in 2006. But the evidence suggests that Michigan hasn't pursued alternatives to racial preferences very diligently.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unlike state universities in Texas, Florida and California, Michigan has no percentage plan to admit top high-school students. Unlike Texas A&M or the University of Georgia, Michigan didn't eliminate legacy preferences. And unlike UCLA and the University of California at Berkeley, Michigan hasn't embraced a robust socioeconomic affirmative-action program. As a result, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor has only about half as many students eligible for federal Pell grants (15%) as UCLA (32%), Berkeley (27%) or the University of Texas at Austin (28%).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If black and Latino voters in Michigan joined working-class whites to support these reforms, it seems likely that the University of Michigan's minority enrollment would rebound. This is the political coalition that has supported substantial economic, racial and ethnic diversity at the University of Texas through the state's top 10% plan, which guarantees admission to the top students of every graduating high-school class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A ruling in Schuette that promotes race-neutral strategies to boost minority admissions would reinforce the message the court tried to deliver last term in</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fisher v. University of Texas but has largely fallen on deaf ears. In Fisher, the justices supported higher education's goal of achieving a racially diverse student body, but they gave universities a strong push toward creating that diversity through race-neutral strategies. The justices ruled that universities have \"the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to racial classifications, that available, workable, race-neutral alternatives do not suffice.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 2003 in Grutter v. Bollinger, the court had said it would take universities at their word that race-neutral strategies wouldn't produce enough racial diversity. But in Fisher the justices ordered courts to strictly scrutinize whether race is necessary in admissions and to give universities \"no deference.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Supporters of racial preferences have ignored the message. The Obama administration recently issued guidance telling colleges that the Fisher decision simply reaffirmed the court's earlier, more relaxed, examination of racial preferences. And colleges plan to use race exactly as they have. In a recent poll of admissions officers, Inside Higher Ed found that only 1% of public and private institutions were \"very likely\" to change policies after Fisher. Only 4% of public and 8% of private institutions were \"somewhat\" likely to change.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A more emphatic endorsement of race-neutral alternatives in Schuette would reinforce Fisher. In a society where unequal opportunity is increasingly associated with class rather than race, a strong ruling in Schuette could move the country toward affirmative action that helps the truly disadvantaged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mr. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, is author of \"The Remedy: Class, Race and Affirmative Action\" (Basic Books, 1996).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Racial Preferences for College Places\" -- WSJ October 23, 2013)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credit: By Richard D.

It knows now, and has fresh cause to regret its 52-to-48 vote of approval for a judge who shows no respect for the work of Congress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Returning briefly last week to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, Justice Thomas finally issued the decision in a case that had been under advisement since January of last year. On that court, even major cases like this are routinely decided in two or three months. Circumstances suggest that the decision was delayed lest it hurt the nominee in his confirmation fight.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But manipulation, even if it occurred, was not the worst feature of the decision in the case of Lamprecht v. Federal Communications Commission. The major vice is something Presidents Reagan and Bush pledged that their high court nominees would not engage in: legislating from the bench, making law rather than interpreting it, substituting personal policy preferences for those of duly elected legislatures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Congress, trying to diversify the overwhelmingly white male ownership structure in broadcasting, ordained F.C.C. policies that opened some licenses to black applicants alone and enhanced the competitive scores for female applicants for new licenses. The plan won Supreme Court approval two years ago and Judge Thomas testified at his confirmation hearing that he had no quarrel with it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Under Supreme Court precedents the slight gender preference, a few rating points, would normally pass constitutional muster more easily than would allocating a category of licenses for blacks only. But no, said Judge Thomas, with the concurrence of Judge James Buckley: the policies produced significant diversity in black stations' programming, while female ownership produced a much smaller increase in diversity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Chief Judge Abner Mikva, in strong dissent, showed how -- until recently -- the Supreme Court had deferred to Congress over just such judgments about how much linkage between diverse ownership and diverse programming was significant. Thus at the very moment Judge Thomas testified he would be content to apply the high court's precepts, he was busy misapplying them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This kind of flyspecking jurisprudence, demanding unreasonably precise proof when the judiciary disagrees with Congress, is not new to the courts.

They sternly called for harsh penalties for offensive speech.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Traveling to various campuses, public and private, I heard from students who had stopped asking such questions in class as whether affirmative action should enfold the children of black middle-class parents. These students preferred to escape into silence rather than being called racist. Some of that is still going on.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The relentless trackers of bad speech, on the faculty and in the student body, were and are predominantly liberals. In my younger days, punitive contempt for the wrong kind of speech came from such warriors of the right as J. Edgar Hoover. When I finally got my FBI files, they were full of articles I had written and petitions I had signed against the Vietnam War -- some of them sent directly to the ever-vigilant director of the bureau -- with sulfurous notations from field agents about my offensive language.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These days, the political and religious right still attack offensive expressions. They make themselves vigorously heard concerning books in school libraries that tear asunder family values, inflammatory rap recordings and perniciously infectious television programs. Some of these watchdogs say they don't intend to censor; their aim is to censure. But they clearly want to censure their targets out of existence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, liberal critics of the First Amendment are growing in number and influence. In a recent issue of the Columbia Journalism Review, Floyd Abrams -- who has litigated many First Amendment cases in the Supreme Court and is a sturdy supporter of James Madison -- has written, \"Look who's trashing the First Amendment.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He cites a declaration by the Nation -- a proudly liberal magazine -- that the First Amendment is being used \"to thwart progressive reforms such as caps on campaign spending, public access to the airwaves, and regulation of cigarette advertising.\" In all these battles, the Nation complains that \"the wrong side kept winding up with the First Amendment in its corner.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yale Law School professor Owen Fiss is also among the liberal trimmers of the First Amendment referred to by Floyd Abrams. \"To serve the ultimate purpose of the First Amendment,\" says Prof. Fiss, \"we may sometimes find it necessary to restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fiss was speaking of the need for restrictions on campaign expenditures. But who will draw these exclusionary lines determining who can express his or her view by contributing? The trusted government, of course, against whom the First Amendment was intended to provide protection of expression.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another believer in using the good faith offices of government to \"enhance\" the distribution of free speech through regulation is University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein. Writes Floyd Abrams: \"According to Sunstein, the government should . . . be permitted to require the news media to provide a `right of reply to dissenting views'; and to impose in public universities significant limitations on `hate speech' on campus.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For government to mandate that the press provide \"a right of reply\" requires government involvement in the content of the press. This prospect might well win a large majority vote from the American people, but the First Amendment was not intended to be subject to a vote -- or to a revision by a law professor. As Chief Justice Warren Burger said in Miami Herald v. Tornillo (1974), the First Amendment forbids government \"intrusion into the function of editors.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Floyd Abrams, aware of the decline in liberals' understanding of the First Amendment, emphasizes: \"It is at the very heart of the First Amendment to deny government the authority to pick and choose among speakers and messages, determining that some may and others may not be heard -- and how often.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1989, Canetta Ivy, insisting that the First Amendment is too generous in its protection of speech, may have been anticipating a bipartisan Zeitgeist. Conservatives and liberals -- though different in their priorities and strategies -- are uniting in wanting to restrain freedom of expression. For the greater good of the greatest number, of course.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/433182604.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>How Not to Get the Job Done</h2<p>On Sept. 9, the Labor Department issued a short memo, signed by a lowly deputy assistant secretary, that undid the law of the land, ostensibly to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The memo relieved new federal contractors of the obligation to have a plan for hiring minorities, women, Vietnam veterans and disabled people on Katrina-related projects. The suspension is for three months, ''subject to an extension should special interests in the national interest so require.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The department's explanation -- that reducing paperwork will encourage more companies to help with rebuilding -- is disingenuous in the extreme. Companies do not need to have an affirmative action plan in place to bid for or win federal contracts. Under normal rules, they have 120 days from the start of a contract to draw up a plan, which is primarily intended to help companies self-monitor their adherence to laws against discrimination. Obviously, if four months is not enough time under the present extraordinary circumstances, the department could extend the deadline. There is no good reason to suspend the rule outright.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The department also insists that waiving the requirement for a written plan does not relieve companies from obeying the laws against discrimination. At best, that is wishful thinking. When the department audits a company on its compliance with antidiscrimination laws, the company's own affirmative action plan is the auditor's starting point. By not requiring a plan, the department undermines its role as enforcer and telegraphs its laxity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cheating is a function of opportunity. Unintentional disregard for the law is often rooted in official inattention. The waiver of the affirmative action plan rule is bound to foster both. That is why such waivers have been extraordinarily rare; there have been only four in the 40 years that the law has been on the books, and each was for a single, highly-specialized short-term contract, including two in the 1980's for federally financed work on commemorative coins. To waive the rule on a project as vast as rebuilding the Gulf Coast is as unwise as it is unprecedented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If Mr. Bush does not reverse course, Congress should intervene. If regard for the law is not motivation enough to do so, legislators must realize that spending huge amounts of federal money while lowering standards is a recipe for disaster.</p>\n"}
{"id": "txt/430866990.xml.txt", "text": "<h2>In Search of Black Voters For a Republican Governor</h2<p>Brett Pulley reports from Trenton for The New York Times.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Leroy I. Robinson is Governor Whitman's great black hope this campaign season. As recent statewide elections have shown, black voters make up a segment of the voting population that alone could make the difference in returning Mrs. Whitman to the Governor's mansion or sending her back to her Hunterdon County estate. And as the state Republican Party's campaign coordinator for African-American affairs, Mr. Robinson is the man the Governor is counting on to deliver black voters to the polls on her behalf. ''My job,'' he said, ''is to get the African-American vote.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But that, of course, is an ambitious task because on average in New Jersey, according to the state Democratic Party, Democrats have consistently won 85 percent of the votes in districts where the population is at least 60 percent black. Moreover, while Mr. Robinson, a district superintendent for the New Jersey Highway Authority, is working on the Governor's campaign as a part-time volunteer, Mrs. Whitman's Democratic opponent, James E. McGreevey, has employed a full-time, paid political consultant whose primary focus is blacks and urban-based voters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But Mr. Robinson is undaunted. In fact, he is confident that Mrs. Whitman will receive significant support from black voters in the Nov. 4 election. His totally unscientific -- and totally optimistic -- prediction is that 50 percent of black voters will choose Mrs. Whitman. ''She has kept her promises to appoint more blacks to boards, to have more black judicial appointments and to appoint the first black Supreme Court justice,'' he said in an interview. ''In the black community, your word is bond. She doesn't shirk and dodge the issues, and black people respond to that.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To be sure, if half the black vote goes with the Governor, it would be likely to spell disaster for Mr. McGreevey. But based on recent voting trends in statewide elections and Mrs. Whitman's current status in the polls, Mr. Robinson may be drinking a little too much of the Governor's Kool-Aid. Indeed, as he correctly points out, black voters in the state have gone to the polls and overwhelmingly selected an incumbent Republican before. But that was in 1985, when Gov. Thomas H. Kean was so popular that 70 percent of all voters chose to return him to office. Mrs. Whitman, for whatever reason, is not enjoying that sort of popularity today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To her credit, Mrs. Whitman, in 1993, managed to capture an impressive 25 percent of the estimated 204,000 black residents who voted. But the total turnout among blacks was pathetically low that year -- a point that no doubt continues to haunt former Gov. Jim Florio, who failed to cultivate his party's base of black voters during that campaign. Mr. McGreevey does not appear to be making the same mistake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another thing that is undoubtedly causing Mrs. Whitman's camp some concern is last November's election, when blacks and other urban voters came out so strong that they pushed Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat, to a landslide victory over his Republican opponent for the Senate, Richard A. Zimmer. Mrs. Whitman has even opened a campaign office in the heart of downtown Newark, the first time in years that a Republican statewide candidate has done so. (The office has been picketed by residents who say they are upset with her for various initiatives, like her takeover of the city's schools and her privatization of agencies.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Still, it will be interesting to see how much Mrs. Whitman can cut into the Democratic Party core of black voters. She has indeed kept her promises regarding appointments and affirmative action, and many black voters are likely to respond.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There was a large contingent of Whitman supporters at the recent Black Issues Convention, and among the 1,500 women who anted up $100 to attend a rally for Mrs. Whitman on Tuesday, a large number were also black. ''When you get a candidate who speaks to the community and addresses the needs of the community, that candidate can cross the party line,'' said Murshell Bland, the director of the Department of Law in Bergen County and a Whitman supporter, who attended the convention. ''She has kept her promises, and I think she'll do extremely well.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Governor has a mixed record on other issues of particular concern to black voters, like education and urban renewal, and Mr. Robinson constantly has to respond to people who say they don't like her because she has laid off state workers and put government agencies in private hands.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To help him get Mrs. Whitman's message out to black voters, Mr. Robinson has enlisted the help of a friend, Kimberly Woodson-Irwin, who also volunteers for the campaign but works full time in Cranford, where she oversees the implementation of the Governor's welfare-reform initiatives. She says she believes in the Governor's welfare program because it ''restores independence, self-sufficiency and returns people to work.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Neither Mr. Robinson nor Ms. Woodson-Irwin is a lifelong Republican. Both said they had voted for Democrats in the past and would continue to do so in the future. As Ms. Woodson-Irwin said: ''I don't just follow the Republican Party anywhere. I'm here for Christie Whitman.'' And Mr. Robinson added, ''We can't be out here supporting someone who we don't know in our hearts has the concern of the African-American community at heart.'' That's a wise concern because as Mr. Robinson, a native of Newark, went on to point out, ''you always have to come home.''</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Brett Pulley.</p>\n"}

Roosevelt's New Deal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Farm workers and domestic servants, two lines of work that just happened to be disproportionately non-white, were originally excluded from contributing to Social Security.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And the Federal Housing Authority, created in the 1930s to help families obtain easy-term home loans, followed national appraisal rules that judged any neighborhood containing non-whites, regardless of a neighborhood's education or income level, to be \"unstable\" and less worthy of financing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The result, as black home-buying opportunities opened in the 1960s, was \"white flight,\" spurred by unscrupulous panic-peddling real estate agents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The impact of these disinvestments was well-described by Larry Adelman, the series' executive producer, during a National Public Radio interview, when he compared the Long Island, N.Y., house his parents bought for $20,000 in the 1950s with one that the parents of his black associate, Cornelius Moore, bought for the same price in Chester, Penn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Adelman's parent's house, in a neighborhood where Moore's parents would have been barred because of their race, sold for $300,000 in 1990.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moore's parents' house sold three years ago for $29,500.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Cornelius and I have made the same money, exactly same salary,\" Adelman said. \"Yet my net worth is several times that of his.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today, net worth (your assets minus your debts) for blacks is less than half that of whites, a gap that actually has grown since the 1960s, according to various experts. A major reason is the head start that whites received from the racially biased access to home ownership, the most expensive item in most American families' nest eggs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since Mel Martinez became President Bush's Housing and Urban Development secretary, he has launched some innovative programs targeted to help minority and low-income Americans become homeowners. Modest as this outreach effort may be, I have actually heard some affirmative-action opponents criticize it as \"reverse discrimination.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If by that they mean \"reversing\" the legacy of past \"discrimination,\" they're right.
