He's different, however. He's a Republican Latino, a rarity in partisan politics, at least until recently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After getting pounded in the election--losing a net five seats--Assembly Republicans selected Pacheco as their new leader, the first-ever Latino to lead the GOP in the lower house. In fact, when Pacheco arrived in Sacramento just two years ago, he was the first Republican Latino lawmaker in 115 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the latest sign of growing Latino political clout--to the point, now, that even Republican Latinos are getting elected to partisan office.

But he backed Prop. 209 to end state racial preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pacheco's the kind of fiscally conservative, crime-fighting, social moderate who just might appeal to voters statewide. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, he pleads.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Folks have said stuff like that to me,\" Pacheco says. \"But you know how this place is: Every {legislative} member gets that--120 legislators wake up in the morning and see the next governor.

My best role is just to go about my business and folks may be encouraged by the fact I'm the Republican leader.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most Latinos, Pacheco says, he opposed Prop. 187 because it targeted schoolchildren and was promoted in a harsh tone. There was some logic to eliminating public services for illegal immigrants, he explains, but \"I equate it to my days as a trial lawyer: Emotion moves people faster than logic. If I perceive I'm being attacked personally, I'm going to have difficulty relating to you in a rational and logical way.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Heading into the next legislative session, the deck's stacked against Pacheco and Republicans.

Though opposition to this gesture has made strange bedfellows out of Jesse Jackson (who called it ''meaningless'') and Newt Gingrich (''a dead end''), Bill Clinton is already hedging about it, a few Congressmen are calling for reparations, and the debate could easily eat up the full year of the President's promised race initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why not just cut to the chase, and have Strom Thurmond deliver the apology right now?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bipartisan, all-white Congressmen sponsoring the apology mean well. But as Eric Foner, the Columbia University historian who wrote the definitive text on Reconstruction, says: ''At the end of the Civil War, the slaves didn't want an apology. They wanted substantive change in the way things were -- 'Give us some land, and you can keep the apology.' '' If Congress wants to apologize, it might start with its own transgressions, from Willie Horton-inspired campaign ads to its persistent inability to address the inner-city meltdown that is the most intractable legacy of slavery and its bastard offspring, segregation, today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this would require substance, not symbolism, and when it comes to substance about race and poverty, both parties would rather play to the gallery. The G.O.P. focus on ending <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is a hit in the polls, so never mind that the party with a Congressional majority has offered teachers-union bashing in lieu of action to deal with the root of all ills, failing schools in grades K-12. Nor have the Republicans found a plausible substitute for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> that might win over the only three major figures in the party with credibility on race -- Colin Powell, Jack Kemp and the lone black Congressman, J. C. Watts -- all of whom favor a just reform of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span>, not its abolition without a net for the poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, has taken hits for what cynics regard as a public-relations racial policy: a call for a national conversation, the appointment of yet another blue-ribbon commission and town meetings that may fade as quickly as the volunteerism summit in Philadelphia. In fairness, he should be given the year he's asked for, and the benefit of the doubt. But you don't have to be cynical to have lots of doubts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid conversation about race -- as opposed to the P.C. homilies of Mr. Clinton's San Diego speech -- is easier decreed than had in a country that has already repressed memory of the stark racial gap revealed by the polar black and white reactions to both O. J. verdicts. As for actions, Mr. Clinton took seven months to fill the top job for civil-rights enforcement in his own Justice Department. At the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, there is now a backlog of 75,000 discrimination cases. And Mr. Clinton has little beyond rhetoric to offer the nation's cities, either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one doubts the President's empathy with African-Americans. But empathy won't get anyone a job, housing or education.

These mayors -- of all races and both parties -- are on the front lines; every day the most creative and committed of them are trying out ''real ideas'' on ''real people''; their proposals for replicating their successes nationally and for targeted Federal funding to help do so would have the credibility that Washington programs do not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the President we do have -- and his political adversaries -- seem inclined to deal with the abstract rather than the concrete. If a year from now there is nothing to show for their efforts but a repeal of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and a loftily written Presidential report, they will truly have something to apologize for.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Better Never Than Late</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not content to deliberate endlessly over how to stamp out the national epidemic of flag desecration, Congress has come up with another bright idea: a bill officially apologizing for slavery. Though opposition to this gesture has made strange bedfellows out of Jesse Jackson (who called it ''meaningless'') and Newt Gingrich (''a dead end''), Bill Clinton is already hedging about it, a few Congressmen are calling for reparations, and the debate could easily eat up the full year of the President's promised race initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why not just cut to the chase, and have Strom Thurmond deliver the apology right now?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bipartisan, all-white Congressmen sponsoring the apology mean well. But as Eric Foner, the Columbia University historian who wrote the definitive text on Reconstruction, says: ''At the end of the Civil War, the slaves didn't want an apology. They wanted substantive change in the way things were -- 'Give us some land, and you can keep the apology.' '' If Congress wants to apologize, it might start with its own transgressions, from Willie Horton-inspired campaign ads to its persistent inability to address the inner-city meltdown that is the most intractable legacy of slavery and its bastard offspring, segregation, today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this would require substance, not symbolism, and when it comes to substance about race and poverty, both parties would rather play to the gallery. The G.O.P. focus on ending <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is a hit in the polls, so never mind that the party with a Congressional majority has offered teachers-union bashing in lieu of action to deal with the root of all ills, failing schools in grades K-12. Nor have the Republicans found a plausible substitute for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> that might win over the only three major figures in the party with credibility on race -- Colin Powell, Jack Kemp and the lone black Congressman, J. C. Watts -- all of whom favor a just reform of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span>, not its abolition without a net for the poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, has taken hits for what cynics regard as a public-relations racial policy: a call for a national conversation, the appointment of yet another blue-ribbon commission and town meetings that may fade as quickly as the volunteerism summit in Philadelphia. In fairness, he should be given the year he's asked for, and the benefit of the doubt. But you don't have to be cynical to have lots of doubts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid conversation about race -- as opposed to the P.C. homilies of Mr. Clinton's San Diego speech -- is easier decreed than had in a country that has already repressed memory of the stark racial gap revealed by the polar black and white reactions to both O. J. verdicts. As for actions, Mr. Clinton took seven months to fill the top job for civil-rights enforcement in his own Justice Department. At the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, there is now a backlog of 75,000 discrimination cases. And Mr. Clinton has little beyond rhetoric to offer the nation's cities, either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one doubts the President's empathy with African-Americans. But empathy won't get anyone a job, housing or education. ''The problem with Clinton,'' says Roger Wilkins, the author and Johnson Administration civil-rights official, ''is he's like somebody who says I owe you some money, and I really want to pay you, but I had to stop by the gambling casino on the way to your house.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since big-government schemes for addressing social welfare are politically taboo, Mr. Wilkins says that if he were President, he would have convened the country's best mayors to identify their ''biggest problems and biggest successes'' in dealing with the crises of race and poverty in their own cities.

It's worth celebrating because Hernandez got right something that Brown did not: the standard for when the Constitution should bar group-based discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hernandez involved jury discrimination, which the court had long prohibited. The question in Hernandez, unlike in Brown, was not whether the state's conduct was unconstitutional; it was whether the Constitution protected Mexican-Americans. But the dynamics of the case prevented the court from answering that question by reasoning that Mexican-Americans, like blacks, constituted a racial minority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's because the political and social leaders of the Mexican-American community at that time argued for equality not on the ground that discrimination was wrong per se, but because they were white. Texas, in turn, harnessed this argument to its defense, pointing out that if Mexican-Americans were white, so too were the persons seated on Texas juries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because both sides insisted that Mexican-Americans were white, Hernandez v. Texas forced the court to confront directly a question it would sidestep in Brown: under precisely what circumstances did some groups deserve constitutional protection? Hernandez offered a concise answer: when groups suffer subordination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Differences in race and color have defined easily identifiable groups which have at times required the aid of the courts in securing equal treatment under the laws,'' the court wrote. But, it said, ''other differences from the community norm may define other groups which need the same protection.'' Succor from state discrimination, the court reasoned, should apply to every group socially defined as different and, implicitly, as inferior. ''Whether such a group exists within a community is a question of fact,'' the court said, one that may be demonstrated ''by showing the attitude of the community.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How, then, did the Texas community where Hernandez arose regard Mexican-Americans? Here the court catalogued Jim Crow practices: business and community groups largely excluded Mexican-Americans; a local restaurant displayed a sign announcing ''No Mexicans Served''; children of Mexican descent were shunted into a segregated school and then forced out altogether after the fourth grade; on the county courthouse grounds there were two men's toilets, one unmarked and the other marked ''Colored Men'' and ''Hombres Aqui'' (''Men Here'').</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same sort of caste system that oppressed blacks in Texas also harmed Mexican-Americans. But it was Jim Crow as group subordination, rather than as a set of ''racial'' distinctions, that called forth the Constitution's concern in Hernandez v. Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, Brown v. Board of Education also responded to group mistreatment. But the court did not state in sufficiently explicit terms that school segregation violated the Constitution because it constituted systematic oppression, rather than because it turned on race. This small lapse left open just enough space for the misreading of Brown that now dominates conservative thinking on antidiscrimination law -- including on the Supreme Court. Brown, the majority now contends, stands for the proposition that the Constitution opposes not noxious practices of oppression but instead only the state use of formal racial distinctions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The anti-caste commitment of Brown lies today distorted, and its efficacy as constitutional law largely eroded. Treating every official use of race as akin to racism, the Supreme Court erects virtually insurmountable constitutional hurdles against all race-conscious government action. No statement better captures this misguided equation of Jim Crow and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than Justice Clarence Thomas's assertion that there is ''a moral and constitutional equivalence between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the court protects from constitutional challenge situations in which racism operates powerfully but not explicitly. For example, even after conceding that Georgia sentenced to death blacks who killed whites 22 times more often than blacks who killed blacks, the court upheld Georgia's death penalty machinery.

But one topic the undergraduates at these institutions -- and at the vast majority of other universities and colleges -- are unlikely to find covered is conservatism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no legitimate intellectual justification for this omission. The exclusion of conservative ideas from the curriculum contravenes the requirements of a liberal education and an objective study of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political science departments are generally divided into the subfields of American politics, comparative politics, international relations, and political theory. Conservative ideas are relevant in all four, but the obvious areas within the political science discipline to teach about the great tradition of conservative ideas and thinkers are American politics and political theory. That rarely happens today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, a political science department may feature a course on American political thought that includes a few papers from \"The Federalist\" and some chapters from Alexis de Tocqueville's \"Democracy in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But most students will hear next to nothing about the conservative tradition in American politics that stretches from John Adams to Theodore Roosevelt to William F. Buckley Jr. to Milton Friedman to Ronald Reagan.

The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>", "displayed_text": "<p>TESTING THE WATERS DROPPING THE SAT WOULD MEAN FAILING STUDENTS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Got a weight problem?

If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/293295109.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/293295109.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>THE STATE; Politics Rears Its Disruptive Head in UC--and Students Suffer; CAMPUS CORRESPONDENT</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In January 1967, Gov.
