On this question, the court split 5-4 exactly along ideological lines in District of Columbia vs. Heller in 2008 and declared unconstitutional a 32-year-old ordinance prohibiting ownership or possession of handguns. The conservative majority chose to read the 2nd Amendment as a right of individuals to possess handguns in their homes for the sake of security, while the liberals argued that the 2nd Amendment is a right to have guns solely for the purpose of militia service.

Each school is then rated according to the performance of the various ethnic and economic groups. This means more attention is paid to every student, and the entire class benefits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, black, Hispanic and economically disadvantaged students are closing the achievement gap. On a national math test given in 1996, Texas fourth graders in various categories -- white, black and poor students -- all ranked first in the country. By contrast, California, where politicians have demonized issues of race, education and immigration, saw its fourth graders, including white students, finish near the bottom, ahead of those in only two other states.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Texas's innovative approaches, and its less polarized environment, are helping to shift an increasingly narrow debate over <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> into a wider public discussion on education.

He went on to win four more terms, with a reputation as the Senate's most principled warrior on behalf of social conservatism, anti-Communism, limits on union power, and an assertive foreign policy that rejected State Department caution. Like Reagan, many of his views appear to have been validated. Others, such as his blind spot on racial issues and mean-spirited comments against gays were troublesome, but even the stubborn Helms made moves to modify his image in those areas late in life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two events early in his Senate career showcased Helms's unflinching nature and his political skills. In 1975, he engineered a visit to the U.S. by Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn over the objections of the State Department, which forbade its own employees from attending a major Solzhenitsyn speech in Washington. State also blocked a proposed visit to the White House, leading Helms to accuse President Gerald Ford of \"cowering timidly for fear of offending Communists.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That incident helped spur Reagan to challenge Ford for the GOP nomination the next year. Reagan lost the first five primaries, and he entered the North Carolina contest broke and under pressure to pull out. But Helms and his chief strategist Tom Ellis refused to give up. They employed Helms's huge, direct-mail list to build a grass-roots army of volunteers and raise money to air 30-minute speeches by Reagan across the state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Emphasizing the Panama Canal \"giveaway\" and smaller government, Reagan won an upset victory and was able to battle Ford all the way to the GOP convention. He showed such strength at the convention that Ford invited him to deliver off-the-cuff remarks to the delegates. Reagan was so inspiring that some of Ford's own delegates exclaimed, \"We just nominated the wrong candidate.\" Reagan later acknowledged how Helms's intervention rescued his political career.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that level of success eluded Helms in a Senate where he was almost always outvoted.

His anticommunist fervor led him to back authoritarian regimes in Chile and Argentina far more than he should have. His 1983 opposition to a Martin Luther King holiday -- he railed against King's associations with communists -- was myopic and a throwback to a discredited past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue of race will always cast a shadow on Helms's legacy. He could never understand why he was viewed by many as a bigot, having run one of the most integrated TV stations in the South and often hiring blacks on his staff. His criticisms of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and forced busing were on the mark. But as conservative scholar John Hood notes, \"he failed to marry every criticism of government overreaching with calls for the South's social and moral transformation and clear denunciations of racist business owners.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the mainstream media rarely put Helms's career in context the way they did, for example, with Sam Ervin, a Democrat who served with Helms in the Senate from North Carolina before retiring in 1975. Ervin was the leading legal strategist against Civil Rights legislation, and he largely crafted the Southern Manifesto against Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court case that ruled school segregation unconstitutional. But Ervin was the man who chaired the Watergate hearings that helped bring down Richard Nixon, and his views on civil rights were almost never mentioned. Both Helms and Ervin were courtly, principled conservatives. Only one became a cartoon media villain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contrary to his reputation, Helms did change his mind. For his first decade in office he opposed aid to Israel and in 1982, after that nation invaded Lebanon, called for \"shutting down\" relations. But after learning more about Israel's security fears during a visit there in 1985, and receiving assurances that officials there could support some military sales to moderate Arab nations, he became Israel's stalwart ally. \"It was a complete switch,\" recalls Morris Amitay, former executive director of AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Helms also softened on both AIDS and Africa.

Gray Davis cleaned up last year railing about California's sorry schools. Pete Wilson left the governor's office on a high note after morphing into an education reformer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For some time, education has been the winning issue for California politicians. Candidates who ignored it--like Dan Lungren last year--were themselves ignored by voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now at least one pollster believes that the issue has peaked and soon will hit the skids as the voters' top concern. \"Health care is charging to the top,\" asserts Steve Kinney of Hermosa Beach, a GOP operative and pollster for 30 years. However, \"infrastructure is the fastest growing issue,\" he adds, and probably will be No. 1 by the 2002 election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's assuming the economy keeps booming. If not, Kinney foresees voters fretting more about taxes, crime and jobs--as they did earlier in the decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney's theory about education as a voter motivator is that the politicians--especially Davis--will talk themselves out of a good issue, like animals overgrazing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the Legislature passes the governor's modest reform proposals, the feds kick in more education money and all the pols beat their chests about how they're fixing the schools, voters will believe the problem is being handled, Kinney predicts. Contributing to this complacency will be the voters' memory of having passed a record $9.2-billion school bond issue last November.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Once it's perceived that a problem has been talked about enough and is being solved,\" Kinney says, \"people focus on a new issue.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As evidence, Kinney points to illegal immigration and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, hot issues that cooled after passage of Propositions 187 and 209. Crime also lost political punch after voters passed the three-strikes initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney bases his analyses on the voters' intensity of concern.

Gray Davis cleaned up last year railing about California's sorry schools. Pete Wilson left the governor's office on a high note after morphing into an education reformer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For some time, education has been the winning issue for California politicians. Candidates who ignored it--like Dan Lungren last year--were themselves ignored by voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now at least one pollster believes that the issue has peaked and soon will hit the skids as the voters' top concern. \"Health care is charging to the top,\" asserts Steve Kinney of Hermosa Beach, a GOP operative and pollster for 30 years. However, \"infrastructure is the fastest growing issue,\" he adds, and probably will be No. 1 by the 2002 election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's assuming the economy keeps booming. If not, Kinney foresees voters fretting more about taxes, crime and jobs--as they did earlier in the decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney's theory about education as a voter motivator is that the politicians--especially Davis--will talk themselves out of a good issue, like animals overgrazing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the Legislature passes the governor's modest reform proposals, the feds kick in more education money and all the pols beat their chests about how they're fixing the schools, voters will believe the problem is being handled, Kinney predicts. Contributing to this complacency will be the voters' memory of having passed a record $9.2-billion school bond issue last November.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Once it's perceived that a problem has been talked about enough and is being solved,\" Kinney says, \"people focus on a new issue.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As evidence, Kinney points to illegal immigration and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, hot issues that cooled after passage of Propositions 187 and 209. Crime also lost political punch after voters passed the three-strikes initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney bases his analyses on the voters' intensity of concern. He doesn't just ask people which issues they consider the most important, as pollsters usually do. He asks how important a specific issue is to them \"personally--on a scale of one to 10.\" Then he counts only the \"10s.\" The others can be swayed too easily to another view, he contends.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney's polling at the end of 1998 showed education still at No. 1, but health care climbing; 80% called education a \"10,\" compared to 67% for health care.

It was also outdated--better suited to an era of politics that is receding rapidly into the past. In 2000, Gore should not have to worry much about disguising his establishment credentials and upbringing; neither should Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who probably enjoys pork rinds no more than his father did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both these front-runners are superbly well-positioned to benefit from one of the realities of Clinton-era politics: the triumph of the elites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The messiness of Bill Clinton's personal life, and the anger he elicits from opponents, have helped obscure one of his principal legacies: He closed a three-decade chapter during which populism-- fueled by the grievances of average citizens toward establishment institutions and establishment values--was a dominant force in American politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the late 1960s, nearly all important political movements have drawn their power from this source. Liberals succeeded in mobilizing voters in a wave of populist grievance against the establishment's prosecution of the Vietnam War. But most populist causes were distinctly conservative in origin: anger at courts for promoting racial preferences and inventing a right to abortion; anger at politicians for high taxes and lenient crime and welfare policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The early machinations of 2000 politics highlight vividly how these movements have been drained of energy during the Clinton years. Polls show the tax-cutting issue spinning with none of its old traction, to the frustration of many GOP lawmakers. Tolerance, meanwhile, has replaced grievance as the new ethos of national politics--as shown by the efforts of presidential candidates like Bush and Elizabeth Dole to mute traditional Republican opposition to abortion rights and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And look what happened to the most recent populist sensation to roil national politics: term limits. Many of the throw-the-bums-out candidates elected to Congress on three-term pledges in 1994 are now busy concocting rationales for sticking around after all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Populism has been dethroned by a directly opposite phenomenon: a rough national consensus that the people who are running America, in the national government and in other public institutions, may actually be doing an acceptable job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Who are the elites of the Clinton era? In the most literal sense, they are the collection of investment bankers, moderately progressive policy experts and political consultants who run this administration day to day. More broadly, they are the community of liberal special- interest advocates, lawyers and foreign policy interventionists whose political values--based on the premise that an educated cadre of experts generally knows what's best for the country--have gained primacy in national life in recent years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is irony here. Clinton first ran for president with a campaign that saw itself as a populist cause. His advisers dressed in denim. His mission was to evict a president allegedly oblivious to the concerns of ordinary voters. Yet after six and a half years in office, the Man from Hope (who was also the Man from Yale Law School) has made American politics safe for Volvo drivers and pointy heads of all stripes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No sensible politician, of course, would choose to present himself or herself to voters next year as the candidate of the elite. But plenty of these politicians are supporting--or at least trying to reconcile their views with--the elite premises that are shaping this year's politics. That's because many of these premises now have clear majority support. Just look at two issues that have dominated Washington's agenda since the end of Clinton's impeachment trial in February: gun control and Kosovo.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gun control and foreign interventionism are both elite enthusiasms of long-standing. And both ideas run against the grain of even older populist traditions. Indeed, both are capable of exciting intense antagonism among people who think elites have no business interfering with gun ownership or risking American lives and treasure abroad except when national interests are directly threatened.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet congressional Democrats, many of whom were punished by voters for gun-control votes in 1994, are pushing the issue anew--secure in the knowledge that it now enjoys overwhelming majority support, even in many conservative districts. Clinton's Kosovo intervention, likewise, enjoyed majority support--even though it was a humanitarian mission in a place most Americans had never heard of before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Budget policy, the other issue that will dominate Washington's attention this year, illustrates how Clinton himself is tugged by competing populist and elitist impulses. In 1993, he famously complained to his staff that they had become virtual \"Eisenhower Republicans,\" as he had to give up the domestic spending he wanted in order to convince Wall Street he was doing enough to lower the deficit. Six years later, he regards the elimination of that deficit as a paramount achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are several reasons for populism's rout. The most important may be the most obvious: the surging U.S. economy. So much money is being made that nearly everyone is reaping the benefits. The preoccupation of 2000 politics will be keeping the golden goose on her nest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A vivid sign that the Age of Elites is upon us came earlier this year when Time magazine ran an idolizing cover story on the \"Committee to Save the World.\" The supposed saviors were Alan Greenspan, the unelected Federal Reserve chairman; then-Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street tycoon; and his successor, Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a soaring Dow is only one manifestation of a larger trend. Crime is down. So are most indexes of poverty. The federal government has tamed its chronic budget deficits. The U.S. military has performed with impressive competence in wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By no means is Bill Clinton responsible for all or even most of this good news, but it is no surprise that he should be the beneficiary of it. Decades of ostentatious failures--from Vietnam to Watergate to a series of recessions--were quite naturally going to produce populist backlash. Success, on the other hand, empowers elites: The Gallup organization reports 55 percent of the country is \"satisfied\" with the direction of the country, compared with just 14 percent seven years ago this month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The defeat of populism also reflects a deliberate political strategy of the Clinton White House. With actions ranging from his signing of a GOP-drafted welfare reform bill in 1996 to his consistent focus on anti-crime measures, Clinton has co-opted issues that Republicans for decades used effectively to tap populist resentment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That strategy has been aided by a powerful tool that Clinton uses more aggressively than virtually any other politician: polling. No previous White House has integrated polling so thoroughly into the policy-making process as this one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At first blush, obsessive polling of the public seems like the most populist politics of all. The paradox, however, is that polling can actually help defeat populist fervors by letting elites know precisely how to accommodate them in the most surgical way possible. Clinton's careful positioning on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>--\"mend it, don't end it\"--is one example.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax cuts are another. No doubt Clinton the Wonk would prefer that the government keep all the money it can. Clinton the Politician, however, knows acutely the dangers of ignoring the popularity of tax cuts. In 1996, he and then-consultant Dick Morris used polling to create a strategy of targeted tax deductions and credits, used to subsidize education and other favored goals. Genuine tax-cut proponents correctly identify the elitist premise of this approach: Why should the government be directing the ways you can spend your own money? To their frustration, however, these critics have seen Clinton's maneuvering deplete the tax issue of its potency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an odd way, even Clinton's sex scandal ended up as a ratification of elite values. For decades, going back to FDR's time, it had been a populist theme that the people running Washington were secretly libertines and hypocrites. Then last year came proof that at least some of those suspicions were true. The public responded, not with populist moralism, but with cosmopolitan tolerance about weaknesses of the flesh.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polls suggest that many people, exhausted by seven years of the Clinton psychodrama, are ready to see him go. But the anti-populist brand of politics he represents stays behind.
