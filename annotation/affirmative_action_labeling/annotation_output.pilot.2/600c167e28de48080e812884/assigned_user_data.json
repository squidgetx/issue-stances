During the Mississippi March Against Fear in 1966, Willie Ricks, a staff member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, discovered the powerful resonance of the phrase \"black power\" when delivering a speech. He told SNCC chairman Stokely Carmichael, who brought the term into popular consciousness at subsequent rallies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what was \"black power\"?

Later, he would identify American blacks as an exploited colony of the United States and attempt to link their struggle to the national liberation movements that flourished throughout the Third World after WWII.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the last word on the subject would not belong to Carmichael. In 1967, corporate interests, led by the Ford Foundation, became deeply involved in financing almost all major civil rights organizations. The co-optation of these organizations and the corporate-financed black-power conferences of 1967 and 1968 were instrumental in redefining \"black power\" as black capitalism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The equation of \"black power\" with black capitalism forestalled the possibility of class-based black-liberation struggles and quickly gained the endorsement of corporate and government leaders.

This is needed, yes--but it has to be accompanied by an expansion of black ownership, of black capitalism.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The failure of black capitalism to end racism is self-evident, as is the need to combine a class analysis with an anti-racist one in order to understand the needs of poor people of color.

What remains to be seen is if these critics are sincere in their desire to help poor people of color or are merely searching for moral high ground from which to attack race-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clinton's seven-member advisory panel must recognize that communities of color are not monolithic, that, like the rest of America, they are divided into economic classes with different problems and different needs. From here, the panel could build a consensus for a more comprehensive approach to fighting racism, not just defending race-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> policies that have proved to be, at best, tokenistic and, at worst, little more than pacification efforts designed to prop up a fundamentally racist system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What would a more comprehensive approach entail? It might examine, for example, how de-industrialization has impoverished inner cities and how attacks on the \"liberal interventionist state,\" coupled with the resegregation of the country through \"white flight\" to the suburbs, have allowed middle-class white voters to tax themselves to pay for direct services while shielding their tax dollars from federal programs that might be used for urban renewal or to help poor people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such an analysis might suggest that the problems faced by people of color who are are forced to attend inferior schools in underfunded school districts could be eased if school funding was equalized through state or federal subsidies. This simple change would go a long way toward establishing the \"level playing field\" conservatives profess to champion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the very least, a more comprehensive approach to fighting racism should acknowledge that racism is experienced differently by members of different economic classes and therefore needs to be addressed through a variety of strategies. For example, middle- and working-class African Americans today experience racism most acutely in the form of racial discrimination and segregation in employment, housing and education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These problems were exacerbated by a series of rulings issued in 1989 by the Rehnquist court that undercut many of the civil rights protections people of color had gained under the Warren court in the 1960s and the Burger court in the 1970s and early 1980s. The rulings combined to make voluntary <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs more difficult to establish and easier to undo, increased the burden of proving employment discrimination and drastically diminished the ability of people of color to fight segregation in employment, housing and education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other legal impediments to desegregation include various loopholes in the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The law is weak not only because it is not vigorously enforced, but also because some of its provisions exempt people who own or rent fewer than four single-family houses, the vast majority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A more sympathetic Supreme Court, closing legal loopholes and vigorously enforcing anti-discrimination laws would help address the problem of racism within the middle and working classes. But legal changes are not likely to help members of the poverty class, whose circumstances are the result of structural changes in the economy. In the latter case, development of a broad-based employment-opportunity program that would include job creation, job training and free or subsidized child care is needed, not new dialogues about race relations. Opponents of government spending on such measures should consider that alternatives, such as building more prisons, are not without cost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: (...), VINCENT KIRSCH / for The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jose Novoa is a student in the ethnic studies PhD program at UC Berkeley and teaches ethnic studies for the Peralta Community College School District</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>THE NATION; RACE; At Times, the Problem Is Economics, Not Racism</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bill Clinton's race-dialogue initiative, a commendable step toward understanding the role that race continues to play in American society, isn't likely to cover much new ground unless the dialogue is broadened to include issues of class as well as race.

For example, middle- and working-class African Americans today experience racism most acutely in the form of racial discrimination and segregation in employment, housing and education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These problems were exacerbated by a series of rulings issued in 1989 by the Rehnquist court that undercut many of the civil rights protections people of color had gained under the Warren court in the 1960s and the Burger court in the 1970s and early 1980s. The rulings combined to make voluntary <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs more difficult to establish and easier to undo, increased the burden of proving employment discrimination and drastically diminished the ability of people of color to fight segregation in employment, housing and education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other legal impediments to desegregation include various loopholes in the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The law is weak not only because it is not vigorously enforced, but also because some of its provisions exempt people who own or rent fewer than four single-family houses, the vast majority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A more sympathetic Supreme Court, closing legal loopholes and vigorously enforcing anti-discrimination laws would help address the problem of racism within the middle and working classes. But legal changes are not likely to help members of the poverty class, whose circumstances are the result of structural changes in the economy. In the latter case, development of a broad-based employment-opportunity program that would include job creation, job training and free or subsidized child care is needed, not new dialogues about race relations. Opponents of government spending on such measures should consider that alternatives, such as building more prisons, are not without cost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: (...), VINCENT KIRSCH / for The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jose Novoa is a student in the ethnic studies PhD program at UC Berkeley and teaches ethnic studies for the Peralta Community College School District</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2244665351.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2244665351.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>Commentary: Reparations are necessary, if we want to move past being a nation of \u2018Sorry, not sorry\u2019</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Wednesday, members of the black community presented their argument in front of a House Judiciary panel for a bipartisan commission to study the issue of reparations surrounding racial discrimination in this country.

Those on the right want to impose state-level bans on teaching critical race theory in public schools. Some also want to remove particular books from libraries and curriculums. On the left, people want to teach about America's history of racism and contemporary systemic racism but from only one perspective, with little if any room for debate. They deny CRT is being taught. I don't believe these are really the only options. Schools can and should teach about race and racism while upholding this nation's liberal values of free inquiry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I know firsthand that American public schools are suffering from highly ideological instruction. I recently received an email from Maryland's Montgomery County Public Schools, where I have two children enrolled in 11th grade, updating parents on an \"Antiracist Audit\" the school system is undertaking. The report describes a new proposed social-studies curriculum, which \"strengthens students' sense of racial, ethnic, and tribal identities, helps students understand and resist systems of oppression, and empowers students to see themselves as change agents.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't know if this technically constitutes CRT, and I don't care. What I do know is that this sort of teaching is highly prescriptive. It doesn't sound open in the least to alternative interpretation or debate. It doesn't invite inquiry or encourage critical thinking. It imparts opinion\u2014that the American system currently oppresses specific people in specific ways\u2014as fact. While there is certainly racism in America, how much of it, where it exists and doesn't exist, and what it explains and doesn't explain about the lives of black Americans and other people of color aren't settled questions and should be open to discussion and debate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wish I could say I was shocked by the audit report's announcement. But the sort of opinion-laden pedagogy it proposed adding to the social-studies curriculum is already a big part of my kids' education. My 16-year-old son has complained bitterly about the discussion of racism at his high school. It's not that he doesn't want to discuss race or racism\u2014he does\u2014but that he doesn't want to be told precisely what to think about every social issue. So saturated has the discussion become about race in school, he told me, that his physics class devoted time to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His English teacher recently asked him point-blank what he thinks the black American experience is in America today. \"I wanted to say that I think black people are as different from each other as white people are, but I could never say that in class,\" he told me. Instead, he kept silent. Kids are expected to parrot back only one answer: To be black in America is to suffer continuous discrimination and indignation. There is nothing wrong with holding this view, but it clearly isn't shared by everyone in the black community.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In my son's weekly current-events class, which discusses contemporary social issues, something he normally loves to do, every single issue\u2014from sexuality to crime to immigration\u2014is discussed through \"a racial equity lens,\" with no room for alternative interpretations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least in college he should get some reprieve. He's ruled out going to a small liberal-arts school, so he won't be stuck in a hermetically sealed ideological bubble forever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My son's experience is far from unique. There is a reason significant numbers of Virginians who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 went on in 2021 to vote in a Republican governor who pledged to push back on CRT instruction. They saw the assignments their children brought home and overheard the Zoom classroom discussions and were rightly horrified.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, the new governor, in response to these encroachments on American liberal values, signed an executive order aimed at ending the use of \"divisive concepts\" in Virginia schools. While some of the examples the order uses to define these concepts are truly violative of existing civil-rights law, it is not always so narrowly tailored. It also seeks to stop curriculum or other education-related policy from including the idea that \"members of one race, ethnicity, sex or faith cannot and should not attempt to treat others as individuals without respect to race, sex or faith.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That example is so vaguely worded that it could conceivably be interpreted as a prohibition against teaching various sides of the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> debate or even about Supreme Court decisions on racial preferences, which would normally be part of a social-studies curriculum. It could certainly make teachers more reluctant to hold discussions on such matters. The executive order's ban is also \"not limited\" to the specific examples it raises and could theoretically deter other important classroom conversations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I want my high-school-age children to learn about the history of this country, including the \"1619\" version. I want them to understand America's legacy of race and racism, chattel slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and red lining. I want them to know that there is still racism in this nation today and about the troubling disparities in various institutions, especially the criminal-justice system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But students like my son should also be exposed to more than one opinion on why there are still racial disparities in America. There's no shortage of rigorous scholarship on the matter. Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson has written several books about the complex role of both systemic and cultural factors in inner-city communities. Columbia linguist John McWhorter, while acknowledging the continuing role of systemic racism, similarly sees other variables at work, including family structure. Brown University economist Glenn Loury has questioned many of the left's pieties on systemic oppression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teaching multiple perspectives and the \"1619\" and \"1776\" versions of American history would be the best way to encourage open inquiry.

Those on the right want to impose state-level bans on teaching critical race theory in public schools. Some also want to remove particular books from libraries and curriculums. On the left, people want to teach about America's history of racism and contemporary systemic racism but from only one perspective, with little if any room for debate. They deny CRT is being taught. I don't believe these are really the only options. Schools can and should teach about race and racism while upholding this nation's liberal values of free inquiry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I know firsthand that American public schools are suffering from highly ideological instruction. I recently received an email from Maryland's Montgomery County Public Schools, where I have two children enrolled in 11th grade, updating parents on an \"Antiracist Audit\" the school system is undertaking. The report describes a new proposed social-studies curriculum, which \"strengthens students' sense of racial, ethnic, and tribal identities, helps students understand and resist systems of oppression, and empowers students to see themselves as change agents.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't know if this technically constitutes CRT, and I don't care. What I do know is that this sort of teaching is highly prescriptive. It doesn't sound open in the least to alternative interpretation or debate. It doesn't invite inquiry or encourage critical thinking. It imparts opinion\u2014that the American system currently oppresses specific people in specific ways\u2014as fact. While there is certainly racism in America, how much of it, where it exists and doesn't exist, and what it explains and doesn't explain about the lives of black Americans and other people of color aren't settled questions and should be open to discussion and debate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wish I could say I was shocked by the audit report's announcement. But the sort of opinion-laden pedagogy it proposed adding to the social-studies curriculum is already a big part of my kids' education. My 16-year-old son has complained bitterly about the discussion of racism at his high school. It's not that he doesn't want to discuss race or racism\u2014he does\u2014but that he doesn't want to be told precisely what to think about every social issue. So saturated has the discussion become about race in school, he told me, that his physics class devoted time to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His English teacher recently asked him point-blank what he thinks the black American experience is in America today. \"I wanted to say that I think black people are as different from each other as white people are, but I could never say that in class,\" he told me. Instead, he kept silent. Kids are expected to parrot back only one answer: To be black in America is to suffer continuous discrimination and indignation. There is nothing wrong with holding this view, but it clearly isn't shared by everyone in the black community.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In my son's weekly current-events class, which discusses contemporary social issues, something he normally loves to do, every single issue\u2014from sexuality to crime to immigration\u2014is discussed through \"a racial equity lens,\" with no room for alternative interpretations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least in college he should get some reprieve. He's ruled out going to a small liberal-arts school, so he won't be stuck in a hermetically sealed ideological bubble forever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My son's experience is far from unique. There is a reason significant numbers of Virginians who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 went on in 2021 to vote in a Republican governor who pledged to push back on CRT instruction. They saw the assignments their children brought home and overheard the Zoom classroom discussions and were rightly horrified.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, the new governor, in response to these encroachments on American liberal values, signed an executive order aimed at ending the use of \"divisive concepts\" in Virginia schools. While some of the examples the order uses to define these concepts are truly violative of existing civil-rights law, it is not always so narrowly tailored. It also seeks to stop curriculum or other education-related policy from including the idea that \"members of one race, ethnicity, sex or faith cannot and should not attempt to treat others as individuals without respect to race, sex or faith.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That example is so vaguely worded that it could conceivably be interpreted as a prohibition against teaching various sides of the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> debate or even about Supreme Court decisions on racial preferences, which would normally be part of a social-studies curriculum. It could certainly make teachers more reluctant to hold discussions on such matters. The executive order's ban is also \"not limited\" to the specific examples it raises and could theoretically deter other important classroom conversations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I want my high-school-age children to learn about the history of this country, including the \"1619\" version. I want them to understand America's legacy of race and racism, chattel slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and red lining. I want them to know that there is still racism in this nation today and about the troubling disparities in various institutions, especially the criminal-justice system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But students like my son should also be exposed to more than one opinion on why there are still racial disparities in America. There's no shortage of rigorous scholarship on the matter. Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson has written several books about the complex role of both systemic and cultural factors in inner-city communities. Columbia linguist John McWhorter, while acknowledging the continuing role of systemic racism, similarly sees other variables at work, including family structure. Brown University economist Glenn Loury has questioned many of the left's pieties on systemic oppression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teaching multiple perspectives and the \"1619\" and \"1776\" versions of American history would be the best way to encourage open inquiry. Students could read Ibram X. Kendi's bestseller \"How to Be an Antiracist\" alongside one of the many articles or books by writers like Messrs. Loury, McWhorter and Patterson.

I was mesmerized.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She was all that I wanted to be. To devote one's life to the fight for civil rights, to use legal skills to effect justice, better yet to make a difference \u2014 I could think of nothing greater. And I was not alone; generations of civil rights lawyers looked to emulate her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ginsburg's vision of gender equality was decades ahead of her time. It went beyond just empowering women to compete for \"men's\" roles. While stereotypes distorted women's view of what was possible, they also impeded men, no less trapped in gender-based assumptions. Equality meant that both sexes should be free to assume all of society's roles without preconceptions. My son can be a caregiver; my daughter can be an executive. When the school administrators wanted Ginsburg to come to school to discuss her son's misconduct, she famously said, \"This child has two parents.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Her record as an advocate before the Supreme Court was outstanding; she argued six cases before the court, winning five. If she had done nothing else in her life, that alone would have been an extraordinary legacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While she continued to be animated by her life's passion for equality when she joined the court, she was not the \"activist\" caricature some in the media have portrayed her to be. She was anxious to avoid upending precedent, determined to be respectful of the opinions of her colleagues. She believed in incremental legal change and emphasized the limited role that a court plays in a constitutional democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Ginsburg's understanding, courts have a critical role to play in identifying new understandings of the Constitution, but they must do so by \"measured motions.\" They are part of a dialogue with other organs of government and with the people as well. She was critical of the reasoning in Roe v. Wade, because it had accomplished too much too soon. She was, as the New York Times's Linda Greenhouse described at the time of her confirmation, a \"judicial-restraint liberal.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She would apply the court's precedents but take pains to situate them in their social and historical context. A Ginsburg decision would tirelessly recount the history of gender-based classifications, the \"stunningly anachronistic\" generalizations about men and women, as she described them, that were embedded in the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When, shortly after she joined the court, she wrote the majority opinion requiring that women be admitted to the all-male Virginia Military Institute, her analysis was classic Ginsburg: a lengthy description of the school, its prestige, its role in preparing men and only men for high-status roles in government and industry. In cases challenging <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs, she would recite the data that showed the persistence of racial inequity in housing, education and employment, the lingering effects of \"centuries of law-sanctioned inequality.\" She prefigured today's debate about systemic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ginsburg brought her own experiences to bear, insisting that legal rules be understood in \"the realities of the workplace,\" a reality she understood well. When a Supreme Court majority rejected Lilly Ledbetter's pay discrimination claim because she had sued too late, Ginsburg dissented, teaching her colleagues about how pay discrimination, unlike discrimination in promotions or hiring, was hidden from view; Ledbetter sued as soon as she found out about it. Goodwin Liu, a justice on the California Supreme Court and a former Ginsburg clerk, has said that when Ginsburg was recounting Ledbetter's story, she was also telling her own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Her judicial influence has to be measured not simply in the decisions she authored, but also in the decisions of her colleagues and lower-court judges, I among them. It extends to areas far beyond gender and race discrimination, including cases about access to justice, disability discrimination, the right to counsel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ginsburg was a reluctant dissenter, concerned about the moral weight of a decision when the court did not speak in a single voice. But in recent years, her role changed with the court's shifting membership. She dissented more and more \u2014 when the majority gutted the Voting Rights Act or enabled businesses to opt out of contraceptive coverage for employees based on a broad religion-based exemption. She dissented when the majority spoke paternalistically about women who felt compelled to end a pregnancy in the second trimester.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2013, years after that conference at which I first heard her speak, I gave the Ruth Bader Ginsburg address at the New York City Bar Association. The justice introduced me, with an unforgettable sense of humor and warmth. Afterward, she sent me a gift, not a fancy academic treatise, but a signed book of her late husband's recipes, with a moving note. If I published my talk, she wanted to make certain that I included the story about Sadie, my mother. That story? Even though I had graduated Yale Law School, Sadie wanted me to take the Triborough Bridge toll taker's test \u2013 just in case!</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg was all I wanted to be</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was in my late 20s, attending a conference for women lawyers in the 1970s.

If she had done nothing else in her life, that alone would have been an extraordinary legacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While she continued to be animated by her life's passion for equality when she joined the court, she was not the \"activist\" caricature some in the media have portrayed her to be. She was anxious to avoid upending precedent, determined to be respectful of the opinions of her colleagues. She believed in incremental legal change and emphasized the limited role that a court plays in a constitutional democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Ginsburg's understanding, courts have a critical role to play in identifying new understandings of the Constitution, but they must do so by \"measured motions.\" They are part of a dialogue with other organs of government and with the people as well. She was critical of the reasoning in Roe v. Wade, because it had accomplished too much too soon. She was, as the New York Times's Linda Greenhouse described at the time of her confirmation, a \"judicial-restraint liberal.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She would apply the court's precedents but take pains to situate them in their social and historical context. A Ginsburg decision would tirelessly recount the history of gender-based classifications, the \"stunningly anachronistic\" generalizations about men and women, as she described them, that were embedded in the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When, shortly after she joined the court, she wrote the majority opinion requiring that women be admitted to the all-male Virginia Military Institute, her analysis was classic Ginsburg: a lengthy description of the school, its prestige, its role in preparing men and only men for high-status roles in government and industry. In cases challenging <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs, she would recite the data that showed the persistence of racial inequity in housing, education and employment, the lingering effects of \"centuries of law-sanctioned inequality.\" She prefigured today's debate about systemic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ginsburg brought her own experiences to bear, insisting that legal rules be understood in \"the realities of the workplace,\" a reality she understood well. When a Supreme Court majority rejected Lilly Ledbetter's pay discrimination claim because she had sued too late, Ginsburg dissented, teaching her colleagues about how pay discrimination, unlike discrimination in promotions or hiring, was hidden from view; Ledbetter sued as soon as she found out about it. Goodwin Liu, a justice on the California Supreme Court and a former Ginsburg clerk, has said that when Ginsburg was recounting Ledbetter's story, she was also telling her own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Her judicial influence has to be measured not simply in the decisions she authored, but also in the decisions of her colleagues and lower-court judges, I among them. It extends to areas far beyond gender and race discrimination, including cases about access to justice, disability discrimination, the right to counsel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ginsburg was a reluctant dissenter, concerned about the moral weight of a decision when the court did not speak in a single voice. But in recent years, her role changed with the court's shifting membership. She dissented more and more \u2014 when the majority gutted the Voting Rights Act or enabled businesses to opt out of contraceptive coverage for employees based on a broad religion-based exemption. She dissented when the majority spoke paternalistically about women who felt compelled to end a pregnancy in the second trimester.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2013, years after that conference at which I first heard her speak, I gave the Ruth Bader Ginsburg address at the New York City Bar Association. The justice introduced me, with an unforgettable sense of humor and warmth. Afterward, she sent me a gift, not a fancy academic treatise, but a signed book of her late husband's recipes, with a moving note. If I published my talk, she wanted to make certain that I included the story about Sadie, my mother. That story? Even though I had graduated Yale Law School, Sadie wanted me to take the Triborough Bridge toll taker's test \u2013 just in case!</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/418950637.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/418950637.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>ANOTHER JOKE FROM THE FIREFIGHTERS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With its cocky, mean-spirited initial contract offer, the Chicago Fire Fighters Union has performed an unwitting favor for Mayor Richard Daley and the people of Chicago.
