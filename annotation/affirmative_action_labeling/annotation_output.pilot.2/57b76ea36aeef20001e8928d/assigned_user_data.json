Sen. Hatch, the GOP chairman, is investigating the leak of Democratic strategy memos on President Bush's blocked nominees to the federal appeals courts. The staff memos document the extraordinary influence of liberal special-interest groups on Democratic members of Judiciary. The Journal published excerpts on Nov. 14.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before I continue the tale of the unfortunate non-leaker, let me say a word about the memos themselves. If you haven't been reading this page, chances are you haven't heard of them. They are the talk of Capitol Hill, but virtually every mainstream media outfit -- the Washington Times being an exception -- has declined to inform readers about what's in them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Somehow it's impossible to imagine such media nonchalance had the memos come from GOP staffers recounting, say, Pfizer's game plan for how senators could get a Medicare prescription drug benefit passed. Proof of GOP collusion with big business would lead the news for days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But evidence of how liberal interest groups are colluding with Democrats to decide which judges get through and which don't doesn't qualify as \"news.\" Instead, the press has been only too happy to help the Democrats change the subject from the substance of the memos to the nonissue of how they ended up on the editorial page of the Journal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So let's review. The memos -- from 2001-02 when the Democrats controlled Judiciary under the chairmanship of Sen. Patrick Leahy -- show the senators took their marching orders from People for the American Way, the Alliance for Justice, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the NAACP. No surprise here, as anyone who's been following the course of Mr. Bush's stalled nominees knows full well. But the extent of the groups' micromanagement is eye-popping and exposes the opposition to Mr. Bush's judicial picks for what it really is: political maneuvering, not principled differences of opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most blatant example is Miguel Estrada, Mr. Bush's former nominee for the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. \"The groups\" object to Mr. Estrada \"because he has a minimal paper trail, he is Latino, and the White House seems to be grooming him for a Supreme Court appointment,\" a Nov. 7, 2001, memo to Sen. Dick Durbin explains. Or, as talking points prepared for Sen. Ted Kennedy put it: \"We can't repeat the mistake we made with Clarence Thomas.\" Mr. Estrada withdrew his name from consideration in September, after seven attempts to bring his name to a floor vote failed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And then there's the Sixth Circuit, where Democrats were asked to delay nominees not because they weren't qualified but because their confirmation might influence the outcome of a particular case. Talk about politicalization of the judiciary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Five nominations -- all for slots designated judicial emergencies -- were pending on April 17, 2002, when a memo explained that Elaine Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund wanted Sen. Kennedy to \"hold off\" on any nominee until the Sixth Circuit voted on the U-Michigan <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> case. To quote: \"The thinking is that the current 6th Circuit will sustain the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program, but if a new judge with conservative views is confirmed before the case is decided, that new judge will be able, under 6th Circuit rules, to review the case and vote on it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now back to the accused staffer. The excerpts from the memos appeared in the Journal on a Friday. By Monday, Democrats had succeeded in turning the spotlight away from the memos and onto the leaks. In this, they had the help of two unlikely allies: Chairman Hatch and Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist. Sen. Frist knew the Medicare bill was coming up for debate that week and, as one Republican insider explains, he wanted \"to keep the partisanship down.\" Remember -- this is the GOP leadership's response to Democratic memos containing such niceties as \"most of Bush's nominees are nazis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Sunday night, Nov. 16, the two GOP leaders authorized the Capitol Police to secure the committee's server room and obtain backup copies of the computer tapes on which staffers' files were kept. Over the next week two federal prosecutors conducted interviews of 50 committee staffers. Then, just before Thanksgiving, Mr. Hatch announced that he was putting an unnamed GOP staffer on administrative leave \"pending the outcome of the full investigation.\" The next step is for forensic computer experts to evaluate the tapes. The total cost of placating the Democrats is expected to add up to $500,000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A statement put out last week by Mr. Hatch's office says that the accused staffer \"improperly accessed at least some of the documents referenced in the media reports.\" That accusation bears scrutiny in light of how the committee's computer system is organized: Until Nov. 16, all Judiciary staffers used the same computer server and had access to a shared drive, a system put in place when Sen. Leahy took over as chairman in 2001 and hired his own IT staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Leahy techies neglected to put up a firewall between the GOP and Democratic staff, making it possible for all staffers to read everything posted on the shared drive. No one hacked into anyone's private files. These are, in effect, Leahy leaks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why is the hapless staffer being hounded? And why is no one reporting the much bigger story of the memos?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Kirkpatrick is the Journal's associate editorial page editor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Partisan Wrangles\" -- WSJ Dec. 9, 2003)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: A Violation of Trust by Judiciary Panel Staffers\" -- WSJ Dec. 15, 2003)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor:A Violation of Clear Thinking by the Senator\" -- WSJ Dec. 18, 2003)</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>The Sound of Silence</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A young man in Washington is in danger of losing his job because of something this page published, which prompts me to say, in his defense: He didn't do it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The young man works on the Republican staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where I hope Orrin Hatch is reading this.

But sometimes it really is more enlightening to watch the paint dry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most important changes, in other words, are often the most imperceptible. That's the case with one of the most overlooked stories of the past year: the return of American optimism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is more unusual than it seems. Americans may be, by nature, optimistic about their personal situations. But for most of the past 25 years, precious little of that optimism was evident when they looked toward their country's future. With only brief exceptions since the early 1970s, a majority of Americans--often an overwhelming majority--told pollsters they believed the country was on the wrong track.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, in its attitude toward the future, America is beginning to resemble the country it was through the early 1960s. Though some surveys still produce more ambivalent responses, most polls now show that a plurality of Americans believe the country is moving in the right direction. Consumer confidence is at a 28-year high. In a recent Pew Research Center survey, nearly half of all Americans described themselves as \"highly contented\" with their lives--by far the highest figure recorded in the past 30 years. Even President Clinton is enjoying his rosiest approval ratings ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans have not surrendered their pessimism lightly. But it has been beaten down by a pitiless procession of good news. The economy, now in its sixth year of growth, has driven down unemployment to its lowest level in a quarter century. The federal budget deficit, which once threatened to submerge Washington, is evaporating like a puddle on a sunny day. Crime is way down, and the rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth are stabilizing after years of explosive growth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The return of American optimism, though, is arguably rooted in something more fundamental than any of this. After more than a decade of doubt, America once again considers itself the capital of the future. During the 1980s, many Americans glumly concluded that the 21st century would be forged in places like Tokyo and Taipei. Now, Americans see the future being shaped in Seattle (home of Microsoft, the emblematic company of the Information Age), Hollywood (which sets the beat for global culture) and Silicon Valley (the Finland Station for the computer and Internet revolutions). \"Is this a great time, or what?\" asks MCI in a revealing ad campaign that would have been laughed off the air not long ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Very few politicians have considered the implications of governing a society in which optimism about the future is again the default position. But if it lasts, this rebirth of American confidence could change politics in ways both subtle and profound.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, both the left and the right have framed much of their agenda around constructing a convincing explanation for the anxiety that gnawed at many Americans. Conservatives pointed their fingers at big government, welfare, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, immigrants and the forces of cultural change; liberals targeted the rich, the global economy and big business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this more optimistic environment, though, those demons are losing their horns. \"There is just less hostility out there,\" says Peter Hart, a veteran Democratic pollster. \"It is a lot easier to get people agitated when things aren't going well.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In some respects, the politics of international trade remains the great exception to this pattern. Yet even the House rebellion against fast-track trade authority in November marked a subtle shift in attitudes. Ten years ago, trade anxieties focused on the fear that the U.S. could not compete with Japan in the most technologically advanced sectors. Today, trade anxieties are almost completely limited to the fear that the U.S. will lose low-skill jobs to low-wage countries such as Mexico. That's not a trivial concern, but it's a long way from the fear of national economic decline that haunted the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The continued skirmishing over trade doesn't obscure the power of Hart's observation. In good times, it's difficult to mobilize the public behind ideological crusades. In these circumstances, voters prefer incrementalism, not sudden change; rather than polarization, they look for convergence. (Clinton has understood this far better than those Republicans still clamoring for more confrontation.) These days, the dominant message from Americans to their capital seems to be: Get along, compromise and stay out of our way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That message can be very much of a mixed blessing. Indeed, the same can be said about the overall brightening of American attitudes. The good news is that the improved public mood encourages both parties to pursue reasonable compromises on the issues dividing them--as they did to balance the budget last summer. But the risk is that the good feelings can easily slide into triumphalism and complacency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, for all the positive trends, America still faces serious problems: too many lackluster schools, stagnant wages for low-skilled workers, the impending cost of retiring the baby boom, inner cities where both opportunity and fathers are scarce. History suggests the good times are precisely the moment to tackle such difficult challenges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the prosperity from the end of World War II to the 1973 oil shock, the GI generation laid the foundation for growth: building the interstate highway system and great public universities, subsidizing the development of the semiconductor and the Internet. At the same time, the nation enlarged the circle of opportunity by ending segregation and filled in the social safety net by guaranteeing health care for the elderly and poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That record offers the standard against which history is likely to judge today's leaders. At the moment, Clinton and his Republican rivals appear content to mostly preside over this era of good feelings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the precedent of America's long postwar boom offers a more productive alternative: investing prosperity to sustain prosperity and share its benefits more widely. The lack of public demand for a more ambitious agenda doesn't obviate the need for one. Pessimism is a corrosive force in a nation's life.

The publisher called it ''a huge black eye.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How could this happen at the most rigorously edited newspaper in the world? We had plenty of warning: his 50-plus corrections in less than four years as a reporter, his evasion of questions about his whereabouts, complaints from colleagues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Apparently this 27-year-old was given too many second chances by editors eager for this ambitious black journalist to succeed. As he moved to more responsible assignments, some editors failed to pass along assessments of his past shortcomings while others felt the need to protect the confidentiality of his troubles. Result: the con artist gamed a system that celebrates diversity and opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times's executive editor, Howell Raines, is determined to get right with readers by letting the ''terrible mistake'' be examined in excruciating detail. In addition to this opposite of cover-up, he assigned another newsroom group to come up with ways to prevent another failure of communication among our editors, the most expert of communicators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's the reaction in Washington, where -- we now know -- the fraudulent reporter came down to stain The Times's coverage of last year's attacks by snipers?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals down here, who only last week had been gleeful at the revelation of conservative Bill Bennett's high-rolling gambling habit, are rendered glum by this embarrassment of the newspaper whose editorial policy they favor. But now my right-wing friends are suddenly up to their hips in their own Schadenfreude. (That's the German word for ''the guilty pleasure one secretly takes in another's suffering.'')</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the culture war. Some of my ideological soulmates say: See? There goes the prestigious New York Times, world paragon of accuracy, newspaper of record, winner of far more Pulitzer prizes than anybody -- suckered for years by one cunning kid. About time those snobby Eastern elitists, twisting the news to fit their prejudices, got their comeuppance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then to the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> angle: See what happens, they taunt, when you treat a minority employee with kid gloves, promoting him when he deserves to be fired?

The publisher called it ''a huge black eye.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How could this happen at the most rigorously edited newspaper in the world? We had plenty of warning: his 50-plus corrections in less than four years as a reporter, his evasion of questions about his whereabouts, complaints from colleagues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Apparently this 27-year-old was given too many second chances by editors eager for this ambitious black journalist to succeed. As he moved to more responsible assignments, some editors failed to pass along assessments of his past shortcomings while others felt the need to protect the confidentiality of his troubles. Result: the con artist gamed a system that celebrates diversity and opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times's executive editor, Howell Raines, is determined to get right with readers by letting the ''terrible mistake'' be examined in excruciating detail. In addition to this opposite of cover-up, he assigned another newsroom group to come up with ways to prevent another failure of communication among our editors, the most expert of communicators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's the reaction in Washington, where -- we now know -- the fraudulent reporter came down to stain The Times's coverage of last year's attacks by snipers?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals down here, who only last week had been gleeful at the revelation of conservative Bill Bennett's high-rolling gambling habit, are rendered glum by this embarrassment of the newspaper whose editorial policy they favor.

On this night, his burden was obvious: to persuade people to deny the president a second term, to point out with precision what the haters hate most.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The motivation to vote against someone is often more powerful than the desire to vote for someone, and in that sense, the president faces a perilous finish to the campaign. He will be relying on his legion of lovers and hope that the haters have hit the wall. He is still stoking the energy of Republican partisans, painting Kerry with the familiar \"out of the mainstream\" brush, while Kerry seems to believe there are still people to be won over in the increasingly small lane in the middle of the road, especially undecided women voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 90-minute session focused almost entirely on the issues that form the fault lines of American politics--abortion, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage, faith, taxes and the role of government in health care and education.

There were simply more targets for Kerry to attack. But the president also played on the dangers the nation faces as part of his contention that a chance for Kerry is not a chance worth taking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the president was put on the defensive several times, especially about the economy. Asked what he might say to a worker who had lost a job to outsourcing to a foreign country with lower wages, the president responded that education was the best kind of government jobs program in the long run. How that will play in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Missouri, which have lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, is unclear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry repeatedly played to a theme of class warfare that has been a Democratic staple since Franklin Roosevelt, but without Roosevelt's rhetorical gifts for empathy. Kerry also sounded echoes of Bill Clinton (\"people who work hard and play by the rules\"), but his style would never be confused with Clinton's either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Social issues</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On social issues, the president was far clearer in ways that will no doubt help him energize Republican partisans, but might be unlikely to win over many in the shrinking pool of undecided voters. He said he didn't know if homosexuality were a \"choice\" as opposed to a birthright, but he reiterated his call for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In addition, he refused the chance to say that a woman had a constitutional right to choice on abortion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That provided a clear opening to Kerry to appeal to women voters, whom polls suggest have been gravitating toward the Democrat since the first debate in Coral Gables, Fla., last month. Kerry said he would only support a justice to the Supreme Court who believed in the constitutional right to an abortion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Loaded lines</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each candidate clearly entered the debate with a couple of loaded lines that they were ready to fire off at an appropriate moment. Neither man's effort was particularly successful, but the president's almost-forced efforts to caricature Kerry as a Massachusetts liberal to the left of Sen. Ted Kennedy appeared to fall decidedly flat, except to the hard-core partisans who can never hear enough of that kind of talk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They no doubt also enjoyed Bush's dig at the integrity of the major broadcast network news operations. For his part, Kerry's analogy to Tony Soprano is unlikely to be part of any permanent debate highlight reel either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Winning the presidency, of course, is about much more than winning a debate and the personal connection that a candidate makes has become fundamentally important in the age of television.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president offered more personal warmth than he had in the other debates, particularly when discussing his wife, Laura. Kerry still cannot match Bush's ability to make a personal connection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the night of this final debate, he seemed to be quite conscious of a steady, dispassionate gaze at Kerry when he was talking, and of keeping his own voice lower. His supporters like it when he shows a little fight and fire, though.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Al Gore's biggest mistake of his presidential campaign in 2000 might well have been that he offered three different personas in his three debates with George Bush. Bush was no Gore in that respect, but he did seem to adjust his style from one debate to the next.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry has used the three debates to great advantage, especially relative to the president, gaining credibility with each. The president righted himself in the second debate in St. Louis and did little to hurt or distinguish himself in Tempe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Final national plea</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wednesday's debate in Tempe likely signaled the last big national moment of the campaign, the final time when millions of Americans paid intense attention to the race. The candidates are likely to revert to rote of their stump speeches and the grind of travel from tarmac to tarmac, narrowcast to hit as many select television markets as possible. Good morning, Dayton. Good morning, Des Moines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Incumbents who don't win debates, Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992, haven't fared well on Election Day. There is a presumption in the electorate that presidents are supposed to be able to perform on television under pressure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They are supposed to be able not only to defend their term in office but to persuade that they deserve another.

For his part, Kerry's analogy to Tony Soprano is unlikely to be part of any permanent debate highlight reel either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Winning the presidency, of course, is about much more than winning a debate and the personal connection that a candidate makes has become fundamentally important in the age of television.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president offered more personal warmth than he had in the other debates, particularly when discussing his wife, Laura. Kerry still cannot match Bush's ability to make a personal connection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the night of this final debate, he seemed to be quite conscious of a steady, dispassionate gaze at Kerry when he was talking, and of keeping his own voice lower. His supporters like it when he shows a little fight and fire, though.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Al Gore's biggest mistake of his presidential campaign in 2000 might well have been that he offered three different personas in his three debates with George Bush. Bush was no Gore in that respect, but he did seem to adjust his style from one debate to the next.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry has used the three debates to great advantage, especially relative to the president, gaining credibility with each. The president righted himself in the second debate in St. Louis and did little to hurt or distinguish himself in Tempe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Final national plea</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wednesday's debate in Tempe likely signaled the last big national moment of the campaign, the final time when millions of Americans paid intense attention to the race. The candidates are likely to revert to rote of their stump speeches and the grind of travel from tarmac to tarmac, narrowcast to hit as many select television markets as possible. Good morning, Dayton. Good morning, Des Moines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Incumbents who don't win debates, Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992, haven't fared well on Election Day. There is a presumption in the electorate that presidents are supposed to be able to perform on television under pressure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They are supposed to be able not only to defend their term in office but to persuade that they deserve another. The president has three more weeks to make that case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOS 2; Caption: PHOTO: President Bush and Sen.

It described a way of trying to think precisely about problems and weighing competing claims. But today our system generally seems to operate at the level of \"all or nothing.\" The Gingrich tax-exempt affair, for example, was immediately driven to the level of Watergate.

But the fact is that CCRI passed, with nearly 30% of blacks voting for it. Our sense of the public mood is that all-or-nothing proponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> need to start making some useful distinctions in public. Such balancing considerations are raised explicitly by the case of Astroline Communications Company.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Astroline was a limited partnership that in 1984 gained control of WHCT, Channel 18, a TV station in Hartford. The partnership benefited from the FCC's \"minority distress sale policy,\" which gives preferential treatment in assigning certain broadcast licenses to companies in which a minority owns a 20% equity stake and exercises \"complete control over the station's affairs.\" That policy was challenged in court on constitutional grounds by a competitor for the Channel 18 license, Alan Shurberg.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to his suit, a federal appeals court struck down the FCC's policy as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. But the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the FCC set-asides in a 1990 decision, Metro Broadcasting v. FCC. Writing for a 5-4 majority, then-Justice William Brennan held that the set-aside policy was legitimate because it achieved \"the important government objective of broadcast diversity.\" This represented the high-water mark of the Supreme Court's support for racial preferences. But in Adarand Constructors v. Pena (1995), the newly constituted Court essentially reversed Metro Broadcasting and raised almost insurmountable barriers to government set-aside programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To see why the court's new color-blind policy in this area makes sense, let's look at facts that have come to light about Astroline Broadcasting. The company has gone into bankruptcy, eventually making its tax records available to Mr. Shurberg, who continues his quest to win the license. In a petition filed with the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Mr. Shurberg contends that Astroline wasn't exactly what it claimed to be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it won its license, Astroline did have a minority who owned the requisite 21% of the company -- its general manager, Richard Ramirez. But according to the tax records, Mr. Ramirez's stake in the company declined to 0.75% by the following year. The records also indicate that Mr. Ramirez, Astroline's ostensible owner, invested exactly $210 in the company. His partners -- all apparently \"non-minorities,\" according to Mr. Shurberg -- contributed more than $23 million.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ramirez acknowledges in an interview that he put up only $210, but says that he also added \"sweat equity\" and that he never gave up control of the company. \"It's preposterous to claim that I didn't run that business,\" he says. Eventually this will be resolved by the FCC and the courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the world of all-or-nothing, the complaints of an Alan Shurberg against the gaming of set-asides have no chance of support from <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> proponents. But a point arrives in an open system like ours, with news widely available, that one's cause begins to develop problems of credibility. People who watched the Texaco case unfold now see big-money class actions being filed that allege racist e-mail in other companies.
