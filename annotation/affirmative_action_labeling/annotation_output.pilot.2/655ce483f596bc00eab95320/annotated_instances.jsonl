We all know that, despite too many setbacks, black Americans are plowing ahead. But, to some degree for reasons that may be part psychological and part tactical, blacks have hesitated to point it out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael T. Nettles points it out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, says the University of Michigan professor of education, an estimated 89,000 African Americans will be getting baccalaureate degrees this year, continuing a trend that saw an increase of more than 50 percent in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. \"Since 1985, when we were just 8.8 percent of all undergraduates, we've been increasing our presence to the point where we are now over 11 percent,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, he noted, the increases have come in virtually every higher-education sector: in the most highly selective private institutions (up by 57 percent in the 20-year period), in predominately white public universities (up 48 percent), in historically black schools (up 14 percent) and in every region of the country -- with the South leading the pack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nettles, who is executive director of the Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute, which prepared the report for the United Negro College Fund, said he's not trying to be unduly rosy-eyed -- merely realistic about the trends his research disclosed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The report just puts a much-needed positive light on what African Americans have accomplished,\" he said in a telephone interview from Ann Arbor. \"We've still got work to do, no question about it. We're not where we should be in enrollment (blacks are just over 11 percent of the nation's college enrollees but about 14.5 percent of the college-age cohort), in graduation rates (45 percent after five years vs. 57 percent for whites) or in faculty (less than 5 percent of the nation's faculty). In addition, while we're graduating 89,000 baccalaureates, we have only about 1,600 PhDs -- out of 44,000 in the country -- and that's where you get faculty.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nettles is concerned, too, that black freshmen lag their white counterparts by nearly a full letter grade in grade-point average. \"That needs to be improved,\" he says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so does the status of young black males.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to Nettles, 63 percent of all African American undergraduates are women, while the rates for other groups are much nearer equal: about 53 percent women for whites, slightly more than 50 percent male for Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The story for African American men who make it to college is not a negative story,\" Nettles insists. \"About 37 percent of the entering African American freshmen are males -- and about 37 percent of those earning baccalaureates are male.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The male-female disparity in college-going rates, though, continues a long-term trend that Nettles can't quite explain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, last year's United Negro College Fund report disclosed that the number of black women earning bachelor's degrees had increased by some 55 percent since the mid-1970s, but by only 20 percent for black men.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We think a part of the explanation may have to do with greater other-than-college opportunities for black men,\" he said. \"The jobs available for boys after high school look better than the jobs available to girls.\" He mentioned military service (black men are 19 percent of new enlistees) and construction work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I suspect something else is going on. I look at public high schools -- particularly in the urban centers -- and see an already noticeable male-female gap. Indeed, you can see the beginnings of the trend in junior high classrooms. I think we're losing the boys long before it comes time for college applications.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still I have to agree with Nettles's positive spin -- and for two reasons. The first is that the enrollment and graduation trends furnish a solid base on which to build future progress. The second, which applies not just to college but to every aspect in black life, is that if you don't know where your successes are, you don't know where to make the next push.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is not mentioned.": "3"}, "stance": {"N/A (not enough information)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 7m 13s "}}
{"id": "test_question_against_testing_2", "displayed_text": "<p>TESTING THE WATERS DROPPING THE SAT WOULD MEAN FAILING STUDENTS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Got a weight problem? Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 22s "}}

He also told her not to bring any of those people to his games.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meaning NBA games, in which 8 in 10 players are African American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daffy? Sick? Tawdry?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Welcome to Donald Sterling's world. It's all the loopier because the female in question is of mixed race and half a century younger than the doddering octogenarian, who is said to have set his friend up with a home near the Beverly Center and luxury cars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let this be a reminder to one and all: Never get tangled up with anyone 50 years younger because it can only end badly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At Tolliver's clip parlor Monday, the day before Sterling was sentenced to eternal shame, the clientele was having a typically passionate, boisterous conversation on race, as Rosa Parks and Jackie Robinson looked on from their posters on the wall. It's been 67 years since Robinson broke the color line in major league baseball, 59 years since Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus, and just a few days since Sterling turned back the clock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sterling's remarks, fresh on the heels of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that suggests we're ready to move beyond <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, followed those by Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy on the good old days of cotton picking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He said we'd be better off as slaves,\" Tolliver said about Bundy. And then Sterling came along.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tolliver was particularly appalled by the part of the recording in which the man said to be Sterling talked about his players. \"He said, 'I buy their food, I buy their cars, I buy their houses. Like he's a slave owner,\" said Tolliver, who said he believes the players are nothing but tools to boost Sterling's already staggering fortune.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither Tolliver nor his customers were shocked by the revelations on the tape. They're well aware that the billionaire property owner once paid millions to settle a housing discrimination case, and he was sued unsuccessfully by onetime Clippers General Manager Elgin Baylor, who said Sterling ran the Clipper operation like it was a plantation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What in the world, Tolliver demanded, had the NAACP been thinking with its plans to honor Sterling after he made a donation to the organization? The group changed its mind when the latest Sterling scandal broke, but Tolliver says Sterling's true colors were already known, and he suspects the owner's charitable donations are investments in image control rather than expressions of true compassion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The barbershop consensus was unanimous on two points:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, that the country has made much progress on race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, that there's a long way to go, because Sterling is anything but a lone man on a tiny island.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I've been hearing it all my life,\" said Warren Allen, a dentist and Vietnam vet. He said people frequently let loose around him -- with the N-word and more -- because he's light-skinned and they don't know he's African American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Race-baiting is alive and well, said Bishop Curtis Gadson of Amazing Grace Outreach Ministries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have people on television and talk radio scaring the hell out of people,\" Gadson said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bishop grew up in the South and recalls segregated bathrooms and drinking fountains. He moved to L.A. 50 years ago and knew immediately that it was a better place. But even now, he said, he sees white people eye him suspiciously depending on the time and place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A whole lot of it has changed, but a whole lot of it went underground, and when Obama became president it all came back out,\" said Ron Simmons, a church elder. \"They couldn't help themselves.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For him, Sterling's remarks deserved full condemnation. He was taken back to 1970, when he was bused from a black high school to an all-white school in Inglewood. The very first day, he recalled, demonstrators greeted their arrival, and one man waved a sign bearing racial epithets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You can't have a good barbershop conversation without a dissenting view, and in this case Drew Palmer took the challenge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sterling's purported remarks were deplorable, said Palmer, an engineer and youth mentor. But he says he's more incensed by the casual use of the N-word in street talk and rap lyrics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why a firestorm over Sterling, he asked, and silence on the objectification of women and glorification of gangs in popular culture? Is it just about capitalism, same as it is for Sterling? And why compassion for millionaire ballplayers who aren't necessarily the best role models, but so little consideration of the working poor who couldn't afford to see a Clipper game even if Sterling allowed them into the building?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Palmer won some points, but no one in the room was about to give Donald Sterling a pass. Simmons, like Tolliver, saw a parallel with the winner of this year's best-picture Oscar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's like '12 Years a Slave,'\" he said. \"Just call it '12 Years a Clipper.'\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>steve.lopez@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: SOUTH L.A.

Two years ago, he was chosen the first Latino Assembly speaker in California history. And Nov. 3, he was elected the first Latino lieutenant governor in 128 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Next came Antonio Villaraigosa, a liberal Democrat and onetime street kid from East L.A. Last February, he succeeded Bustamante as speaker and, in 2001, may run for L.A. mayor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now comes Rod Pacheco from Riverside, the latest Latino to move up in legislative leadership and into the hierarchy of California politics. He's different, however. He's a Republican Latino, a rarity in partisan politics, at least until recently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After getting pounded in the election--losing a net five seats--Assembly Republicans selected Pacheco as their new leader, the first-ever Latino to lead the GOP in the lower house. In fact, when Pacheco arrived in Sacramento just two years ago, he was the first Republican Latino lawmaker in 115 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the latest sign of growing Latino political clout--to the point, now, that even Republican Latinos are getting elected to partisan office. Three more GOP Latinos won Assembly races Nov. 3, quadrupling their seats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all, one in five members of the next Legislature will be Latino--24 total, up from 18 last session. There'll be 17 in the Assembly, seven in the Senate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And for the GOP, Pacheco's rise, plus the three new Latino lawmakers, are among the few bright spots that have emerged from a disastrous election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican party is desperate for credible messengers who can persuade Latino voters they shouldn't keep blaming the GOP for Gov. Pete Wilson's fiery crusades against <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and illegal immigration, his doomsday TV ads warning that \"they keep coming.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consequently, there's considerable rooting for Pacheco within the party. The new minority leader still is an unknown--he has been a legislator only two years and nobody knows whether he can lead--but already there's speculation about a future statewide candidacy. For attorney general? Governor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's only 40. He's a former prosecutor who didn't lose a case in 10 years and sent five murderers to death row. He's a centrist who supports abortion rights and opposed Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative. But he backed Prop. 209 to end state racial preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pacheco's the kind of fiscally conservative, crime-fighting, social moderate who just might appeal to voters statewide. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, he pleads.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Folks have said stuff like that to me,\" Pacheco says. \"But you know how this place is: Every {legislative} member gets that--120 legislators wake up in the morning and see the next governor. That's partly their own ambition and partly everybody slapping them on the back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"No. 2, I'm not sure that's my future. I live by the motto, 'Man makes plans and God laughs.' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pacheco believes Latinos can be drawn to the Republican party because of common views about safer streets, family values, lower taxes, less regulation and better schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if the GOP wants to use him as a party recruiter of Latinos, he's uncomfortable with that. \"I don't think it's my role to carry the banner,\" he says. \"That's up to the party. My best role is just to go about my business and folks may be encouraged by the fact I'm the Republican leader.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most Latinos, Pacheco says, he opposed Prop. 187 because it targeted schoolchildren and was promoted in a harsh tone. There was some logic to eliminating public services for illegal immigrants, he explains, but \"I equate it to my days as a trial lawyer: Emotion moves people faster than logic. If I perceive I'm being attacked personally, I'm going to have difficulty relating to you in a rational and logical way.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Heading into the next legislative session, the deck's stacked against Pacheco and Republicans. They're down 48-32 in the Assembly and 25-15 in the Senate, with a Democratic governor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, he says, \"We need to be assertive. There's the possibility Democrats could be giddy with the elections and think we're irrelevant. But we won't be irrelevant because any bill {requiring a two-thirds vote} will need Republicans. I didn't come here to fight. I could have stayed in the DA's office and fought. But if Democrats don't reach across the aisle, we're probably going to fight more often than not.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrat he'll be fighting with the most is another Latino, Speaker Villaraigosa. And that's a healthy sign for political diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's a new era in California politics--more moderate and more Latino. As for Republican Latinos, the GOP can only hope \"they keep coming.\"</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}

Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening, who assumed the leadership of the campus nearly two years ago, is getting ready to determine who will be on the Diversity Council and what it will do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The effort is worthwhile, and its timing could not be better. Last month a regent of the University of California, Ward Connerly, spoke out against <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in the community and said he would try to propose a method of ending race-based preferences in hiring and admissions. Although diversity and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> are not the same thing, they do tend to get tangled up in the oft-heated conversations on those topics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A consultant told UCI officials that the campus seems committed to diversity at the top and at the grass roots, but needs more support for the concept in the middle. That will be the job of the Diversity Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UCI has performed well off-campus in promoting diversity. One example was welcoming Fullerton high school students who wanted to learn more about people from different ethnic backgrounds. Those students then helped launch cultural diversity programs at their school. UCI graduates have been active in fostering diversity as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Huntington Beach, UCI graduate Alma L. Lopez has helped create a large mural at the art center that shows the various cultures in the county.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On campus too UCI has tried to blend students from varying backgrounds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its percentage of Asian students, 44%, is the largest in the University of California system. They benefit from events such as this month's 11th annual Asian Pacific Awareness Conference, which has the praiseworthy goal of explaining differences among the many cultures of Asia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, one area where the campus needs improvement is increasing the numbers of women and minorities it hires and promotes as faculty members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since arriving on campus, Wilkening has consistently said she believes UCI's diversity is an asset and a selling point. Those beliefs resonate in the community as well. Last year the Orange County Annual Survey found that nearly four out of five residents said the county needed programs to increase dialogue among ethnic groups. That was a realistic assessment of the need for all residents to get along in an increasingly diverse Orange County.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Somewhat Against ": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 20s "}}

I started this latest round of the debate with the presumption that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popularly strong but legislatively weak. Since Sandy Hook in 2012, more than two dozen states have passed gun laws and almost all of those laws have LOOSENED gun restrictions. Roughly 360 gun bills have been introduced in Congress, and they have all failed but one, which also loosened gun use.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The blunt fact is that Republicans control most legislatures. To get anything passed, I thought, it would be necessary to separate some Republicans from the absolutist N.R.A. position. To do that you have to depolarize the issue: show gun owners some respect, put red state figures at the head and make the gun discussion look more like the opioid discussion. The tribalists in this country have little interest in the opioid issue. As a result, a lot of pragmatic things are being done across partisan lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The people pushing for gun restrictions have basically done the exact opposite of what I thought was wise. Instead of depolarizing the issue they have massively polarized it. The students from Parkland are being assisted by all the usual hyper-polarizing left-wing groups: Planned Parenthood, Move On and the Women's March. The rhetoric has been extreme. Marco Rubio has been likened to a mass murderer while the N.R.A. has been called a terrorist organization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The early results would seem to completely vindicate my position. The Florida Legislature turned aside gun restrictions. New gun measures in Congress have been quickly shelved. Democrats are more likely to lose House and Senate seats in the key 2018 pro-gun states. The losing streak continues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet I have to admit that something bigger is going on. It could be that progressives understood something I didn't. It could be that you can win more important victories through an aggressive cultural crusade than you can through legislation. Progressives could be on the verge of delegitimizing their foes, on guns but also much else, rendering them untouchable for anybody who wants to stay in polite society. That would produce social changes far vaster than limiting assault rifles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two things have fundamentally changed the landscape. First, over the past two years conservatives have self-marginalized. In supporting Donald Trump they have tied themselves to a man whose racial prejudices, sexual behavior and personal morality put him beyond the pale of decent society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While becoming the movement of Dinesh D'Souza, Sean Hannity and Franklin Graham, they have essentially expelled the leaders and thinkers who have purchase in mainstream culture. Conservatism is now less a political or philosophic movement and more a separatist subculture that participates in its own ostracism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, progressives are getting better and more aggressive at silencing dissenting behavior. All sorts of formerly legitimate opinions have now been deemed beyond the pale on elite campuses. Speakers have been disinvited and careers destroyed. The boundaries are being redrawn across society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Andrew Sullivan noted recently, \"workplace codes today read like campus speech codes of a few years ago.\" There are a number of formerly popular ideas that can now end your career: the belief that men and women have inherent psychological differences, the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, opposition to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's happening today is that certain ideas about gun rights, and maybe gun ownership itself, are being cast in the realm of the morally illegitimate and socially unacceptable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's the importance of the corporate efforts to end N.R.A. affiliations. It's not about N.R.A. members saving some money when they fly. It's that they are not morally worthy of being among the affiliated groups. The idea is to stigmatize.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If progressives can cut what's left of the conservative movement off from mainstream society, they will fundamentally alter the culture war. We think of the culture war as this stagnant thing in which both sides scream at each other. But eventually there could be a winner. Progressives have won on most social issues. They could win on nearly everything else.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Continued school shootings could be just the thing that persuades the mainstream that conservatism is vulgar and socially illegitimate, somewhere between smoking and segregationism. If that kind of total victory is on offer for progressives, why should they take my advice and tone things down for the sake of a few small gun laws? The big prize here is not gun laws. It's winning the culture war, with the gunfight as the final battle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only thing I'd say to my progressive friends is, be careful how you win your victories. It is one thing to win by persuasion and another thing to win by elite cultural intimidation. Illiberalism breeds illiberalism. Using elite power, whether economic or cultural, to silence less educated foes usually produces a backlash.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives have zero cultural power, but they have immense political power. Even today, voters trust Republicans on the gun issue more than Democrats. If you exile 40 percent of the country from respectable society they will mount a political backlash that will make Donald Trump look like Adlai Stevenson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is not mentioned.": "3"}, "stance": {"N/A (not enough information)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 51s "}}

Northern Virginia today offers a snapshot of how <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, intended as a benevolent effort to prevent discrimination, has hardened into an ugly war on achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest fuss was kicked off before Christmas when Asra Nomani, an India-born mom and reporter, wrote a piece for the Manhattan Institute's City Journal detailing how her son's Virginia high school never informed him he'd been recognized by the National Merit Scholarship Program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology -- known as \"TJ\" and regularly ranked America's No. 1 high school -- said they had the same experience. So Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares launched a civil-rights investigation on Jan. 4. Days later, principals at two more Fairfax County high schools, Westfield and Langley, admitted they too had failed to inform student award winners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Miyares then expanded his investigation to all Fairfax County. No sooner had he done so than neighboring Loudoun County reported that three of its high schools had delayed notifying its students -- though officials insisted it wasn't intentional. On Friday, four more Fairfax high schools fessed up, followed by another on Monday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The National Merit Scholarship Program is a competition of 1.5 million students, based on their scores on the Preliminary Standard Achievement Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test. \"Commended Students\" rank in the top 3%, while \"Semifinalists\" test in the top 1%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's an achievement that can make a difference on a college or scholarship application. But the kids who weren't told they were National Merit winners, or were told too late, couldn't include it on their applications.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given that the program leaves notifications up to the individual schools, it's possible that all these failures were bureaucratic snafus. But the context offers a less generous reading. Public education in Fairfax County has become the front line for an equity agenda that has hardened into a war on achievers, who are disproportionately Asian-American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a federal judge pointed out in 2022 in a case contesting TJ's new admissions policy, the Fairfax County School Board eliminated the merit-based entrance exam to make room for African-American and Hispanic students by reducing the number of Asian-Americans. In that sense it \"worked.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The class admitted before the change was 73.05% Asian-American, 3.29% Hispanic and 1.23% African-American. After the change, these figures went to 54.36%, 11.27% and 7.09%, respectively. The share of white students grew from 17.70% to 22.36%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meantime, in October district officials signed a $455,000 contract for strategic planning with consultant Mutiu Fagbayi of Performance Fact Inc. A PowerPoint presentation he'd already delivered at a September 2022 Fairfax County School Board retreat defines equity as \"equal outcomesfor every student,without exception.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or consider Shawnna Yashar, another TJ mom, whose son wasn't told he was a commended student until after the deadline for his early admissions application. Ms. Yashar says that when she complained to TJ's director of student services, Brandon Kosatka, he told her that the school wants \"to recognize students for who they are as individuals, not focus on their achievements,\" and that it delayed informing winners to spare the feelings of those who didn't qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard not to notice that those who paid the price for this approach were overwhelmingly Asian-American, judging by the names on the National Merit Semifinalists' list published by Fairfax County. Asian-Americans at TJ accounted for 101 of the 132 winners, or 77%. At Langley it was 10 of 15 (66%), and for Westfield it was four of five (80%).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asian-Americans make up only 18.97% of the student population of the Fairfax County public schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What makes Asian-American achievement so resented by our equity warriors is that it exposes as false the narrative about an irredeemably racist America where minorities can't succeed. This progressive disdain for Asian-Americans is amplified by a resentment of moms and dads who believe they should have a say in their kids' educations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Virginia, parents watched teachers unions agitate to keep classrooms closed during Covid. They learned the National School Boards Association asked the Biden administration to regard angry parents who showed up to public meetings demanding accountability as domestic terrorists. And they heard a schools superintendent in Loudoun County lying to them about a brutal sexual assault of a 15-year-girl in a school bathroom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now these same officials want parents, especially Asian-American parents, to believe that not informing their children that they won a prestigious academic competition was an innocent oversight. We'll see what the attorney general finds. But nothing these school officials have done has earned them a presumption of trust.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to mcgurn@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Strongly Against": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 47s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/421525331.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Commentary; COLUMN RIGHT/ JAMES W. ROBINSON; Eight-Hour Bill Shows Davis' True Colors; Forget what he says about charting a centrist course. Look at the actions he's taken since he was elected last fall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sooner or later it had to happen. After carefully cultivating the image that he is making good on his campaign pledge to lead California from the center, Gov. Gray Davis has taken a sharp turn leftward by signing legislation making California the only state except Alaska to require overtime pay after an eight-hour day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The decision unmasks a reality that state Republicans--still shell-shocked after last November's drubbing at the polls--have yet to effectively challenge Davis on, which is that the new governor's course is not nearly as centrist as he would like us to believe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Flanked on the left by an unarguably liberal California Legislature and the labor, environmental and trial lawyer interest groups that backed his candidacy, Davis barely needs to break a sweat to look moderate by comparison. But he can't leave those constituencies completely empty-handed--and he certainly hasn't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State labor laws across the nation generally require overtime pay after a 40-hour week. Employers are comfortable with that rule and report that most employees governed by it seem to enjoy the flexibility of working fewer hours some days and making up the time on other days. The bill that Davis signed on Tuesday was one of organized labor's top legislative priorities for the year. It reverses a decision by the Industrial Welfare Commission two years ago to scrap overtime pay after an eight-hour day in favor of the 40-hour rule.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Jan. 1, 2000, California will thus become one of two states to require overtime pay after eight hours, which in this state affects some 8 million employees and tens of thousands of businesses. California workers and companies alike will lose flexibility. Employees now working more than eight hours a day but less than 40 hours a week will likely lose pay. And California's business climate can now be justifiably indicted by other states competing for investment and jobs as having the country's singularly most rigid regulatory regime governing workplaces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While unions celebrated, Davis and his aides struggled to claim that, at the governor's insistence, employers' concerns were accommodated in the legislation with provisions allowing various exemptions. But those provisions offer nothing more than a fig leaf of flexibility, and neither Republican legislators nor the state's major business organizations bought it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conventional wisdom among Capitol-watchers has held that Davis alternates between tacking a little bit to the left, then a little bit to the right, keeping allies generally mollified, critics off-balance and his centrist image intact. Exhibiting the same message discipline they demonstrated throughout the campaign, Davis and his spinmeisters chant the \"I am governing from the center\" mantra virtually every day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But does the message match the record? Forcing state businesses to don a new regulatory straitjacket prescribed in the eight-hour legislation is not the first time in his young administration that Davis has veered off center. Union, environmental and trial lawyer activists have been rewarded with top appointments drawn from their ranks. Davis has orchestrated the reinstitution of a form of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> at the University of California. Despite promising a new relationship with Mexico, he is still on record opposing NAFTA and shows no sign of challenging his union supporters by backing other free-trade measures that can help California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tougher challenges to Davis' moderate image lie ahead. Will he approve legislation piling new mandates on health care plans and allowing patients to sue HMOs? How far will he go on gun control, labor and the environment? As reported by The Times' George Skelton, the governor and his aides are alarmed that an avalanche of bills landing on his desk on these subjects could, with increasing frequency, force Davis to choose between his natural political allies and his pledge to govern from the middle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis is no flaming liberal. He seems to genuinely understand the limits of government power and especially the limits to the voters' patience for a return to the halcyon days of big government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Sacramento is made up of more than just a governor, and a vast state administration is made up of more than one man. Union leaders, trial lawyers, environmentalists and activists who believe in regulatory expansion are in charge again. Every so often Davis tells them to slow down. But he doesn't tell them to stop.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James W. Robinson is advisor to the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Brown</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ian Haney Lopez, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, is the author of ''Racism on Trial: The Chicano Fight for Justice.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With commemorations from coast to coast to remind them, most Americans already know that this week was the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Unfortunately, what they don't realize is that the country missed an equally important anniversary two weeks ago, that of Hernandez v. Texas -- the perennially overshadowed antecedent to Brown that was decided on May 3, 1954.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That case merits commemoration not just because the Supreme Court used it to finally extend constitutional protection to Mexican-Americans, important though that is, especially now that Latinos are the largest minority group. It's worth celebrating because Hernandez got right something that Brown did not: the standard for when the Constitution should bar group-based discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hernandez involved jury discrimination, which the court had long prohibited. The question in Hernandez, unlike in Brown, was not whether the state's conduct was unconstitutional; it was whether the Constitution protected Mexican-Americans. But the dynamics of the case prevented the court from answering that question by reasoning that Mexican-Americans, like blacks, constituted a racial minority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's because the political and social leaders of the Mexican-American community at that time argued for equality not on the ground that discrimination was wrong per se, but because they were white. Texas, in turn, harnessed this argument to its defense, pointing out that if Mexican-Americans were white, so too were the persons seated on Texas juries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because both sides insisted that Mexican-Americans were white, Hernandez v. Texas forced the court to confront directly a question it would sidestep in Brown: under precisely what circumstances did some groups deserve constitutional protection? Hernandez offered a concise answer: when groups suffer subordination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Differences in race and color have defined easily identifiable groups which have at times required the aid of the courts in securing equal treatment under the laws,'' the court wrote. But, it said, ''other differences from the community norm may define other groups which need the same protection.'' Succor from state discrimination, the court reasoned, should apply to every group socially defined as different and, implicitly, as inferior. ''Whether such a group exists within a community is a question of fact,'' the court said, one that may be demonstrated ''by showing the attitude of the community.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How, then, did the Texas community where Hernandez arose regard Mexican-Americans? Here the court catalogued Jim Crow practices: business and community groups largely excluded Mexican-Americans; a local restaurant displayed a sign announcing ''No Mexicans Served''; children of Mexican descent were shunted into a segregated school and then forced out altogether after the fourth grade; on the county courthouse grounds there were two men's toilets, one unmarked and the other marked ''Colored Men'' and ''Hombres Aqui'' (''Men Here'').</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same sort of caste system that oppressed blacks in Texas also harmed Mexican-Americans. But it was Jim Crow as group subordination, rather than as a set of ''racial'' distinctions, that called forth the Constitution's concern in Hernandez v. Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, Brown v. Board of Education also responded to group mistreatment. But the court did not state in sufficiently explicit terms that school segregation violated the Constitution because it constituted systematic oppression, rather than because it turned on race. This small lapse left open just enough space for the misreading of Brown that now dominates conservative thinking on antidiscrimination law -- including on the Supreme Court. Brown, the majority now contends, stands for the proposition that the Constitution opposes not noxious practices of oppression but instead only the state use of formal racial distinctions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The anti-caste commitment of Brown lies today distorted, and its efficacy as constitutional law largely eroded. Treating every official use of race as akin to racism, the Supreme Court erects virtually insurmountable constitutional hurdles against all race-conscious government action. No statement better captures this misguided equation of Jim Crow and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than Justice Clarence Thomas's assertion that there is ''a moral and constitutional equivalence between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the court protects from constitutional challenge situations in which racism operates powerfully but not explicitly. For example, even after conceding that Georgia sentenced to death blacks who killed whites 22 times more often than blacks who killed blacks, the court upheld Georgia's death penalty machinery. Under 14th Amendment law, any use of race encounters the same constitutional hostility; but systematic discrimination, if not expressly based on race, receives the Constitution's blessing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The current court reasons as if Brown held that it is race per se, rather than racism and maltreatment, that offends the Constitution. In this, Brown itself is partly to blame. Confident that the 14th Amendment protected blacks, Chief Justice Earl Warren in Brown did not expressly explain why this was so: not because they were a race, but because they were oppressed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the title ''What Brown v. Board of Education Should Have Said,'' Jack Balkin, a Yale law school professor, recently enlisted legal scholars to rewrite that decision in a manner that might have prevented the distortions that now mar constitutional antidiscrimination law. But the exercise is largely unnecessary. Chief Justice Warren already said what Brown should have. He did so two weeks earlier, in Hernandez v. Texas. After 50 years, the time has come for courts and scholars to install Hernandez where it belongs: at the center, with Brown, of a robust 14th Amendment law committed to ending racial subordination.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 57s "}}

Sen. Hatch, the GOP chairman, is investigating the leak of Democratic strategy memos on President Bush's blocked nominees to the federal appeals courts. The staff memos document the extraordinary influence of liberal special-interest groups on Democratic members of Judiciary. The Journal published excerpts on Nov. 14.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before I continue the tale of the unfortunate non-leaker, let me say a word about the memos themselves. If you haven't been reading this page, chances are you haven't heard of them. They are the talk of Capitol Hill, but virtually every mainstream media outfit -- the Washington Times being an exception -- has declined to inform readers about what's in them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Somehow it's impossible to imagine such media nonchalance had the memos come from GOP staffers recounting, say, Pfizer's game plan for how senators could get a Medicare prescription drug benefit passed. Proof of GOP collusion with big business would lead the news for days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But evidence of how liberal interest groups are colluding with Democrats to decide which judges get through and which don't doesn't qualify as \"news.\" Instead, the press has been only too happy to help the Democrats change the subject from the substance of the memos to the nonissue of how they ended up on the editorial page of the Journal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So let's review. The memos -- from 2001-02 when the Democrats controlled Judiciary under the chairmanship of Sen. Patrick Leahy -- show the senators took their marching orders from People for the American Way, the Alliance for Justice, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the NAACP. No surprise here, as anyone who's been following the course of Mr. Bush's stalled nominees knows full well. But the extent of the groups' micromanagement is eye-popping and exposes the opposition to Mr. Bush's judicial picks for what it really is: political maneuvering, not principled differences of opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most blatant example is Miguel Estrada, Mr. Bush's former nominee for the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. \"The groups\" object to Mr. Estrada \"because he has a minimal paper trail, he is Latino, and the White House seems to be grooming him for a Supreme Court appointment,\" a Nov. 7, 2001, memo to Sen. Dick Durbin explains. Or, as talking points prepared for Sen. Ted Kennedy put it: \"We can't repeat the mistake we made with Clarence Thomas.\" Mr. Estrada withdrew his name from consideration in September, after seven attempts to bring his name to a floor vote failed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And then there's the Sixth Circuit, where Democrats were asked to delay nominees not because they weren't qualified but because their confirmation might influence the outcome of a particular case. Talk about politicalization of the judiciary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Five nominations -- all for slots designated judicial emergencies -- were pending on April 17, 2002, when a memo explained that Elaine Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund wanted Sen. Kennedy to \"hold off\" on any nominee until the Sixth Circuit voted on the U-Michigan <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> case. To quote: \"The thinking is that the current 6th Circuit will sustain the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program, but if a new judge with conservative views is confirmed before the case is decided, that new judge will be able, under 6th Circuit rules, to review the case and vote on it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now back to the accused staffer. The excerpts from the memos appeared in the Journal on a Friday. By Monday, Democrats had succeeded in turning the spotlight away from the memos and onto the leaks. In this, they had the help of two unlikely allies: Chairman Hatch and Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist. Sen. Frist knew the Medicare bill was coming up for debate that week and, as one Republican insider explains, he wanted \"to keep the partisanship down.\" Remember -- this is the GOP leadership's response to Democratic memos containing such niceties as \"most of Bush's nominees are nazis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Sunday night, Nov. 16, the two GOP leaders authorized the Capitol Police to secure the committee's server room and obtain backup copies of the computer tapes on which staffers' files were kept. Over the next week two federal prosecutors conducted interviews of 50 committee staffers. Then, just before Thanksgiving, Mr. Hatch announced that he was putting an unnamed GOP staffer on administrative leave \"pending the outcome of the full investigation.\" The next step is for forensic computer experts to evaluate the tapes. The total cost of placating the Democrats is expected to add up to $500,000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A statement put out last week by Mr. Hatch's office says that the accused staffer \"improperly accessed at least some of the documents referenced in the media reports.\" That accusation bears scrutiny in light of how the committee's computer system is organized: Until Nov. 16, all Judiciary staffers used the same computer server and had access to a shared drive, a system put in place when Sen. Leahy took over as chairman in 2001 and hired his own IT staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Leahy techies neglected to put up a firewall between the GOP and Democratic staff, making it possible for all staffers to read everything posted on the shared drive. No one hacked into anyone's private files. These are, in effect, Leahy leaks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why is the hapless staffer being hounded? And why is no one reporting the much bigger story of the memos?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Kirkpatrick is the Journal's associate editorial page editor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Partisan Wrangles\" -- WSJ Dec. 9, 2003)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: A Violation of Trust by Judiciary Panel Staffers\" -- WSJ Dec. 15, 2003)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor:A Violation of Clear Thinking by the Senator\" -- WSJ Dec. 18, 2003)</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is not mentioned.": "3"}, "stance": {"N/A (not enough information)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 54s "}}

In their different ways the two societies will be preoccupied by the dynamics of internal power. Any attempt by the two Governments to do business with each other will be conditioned on those twin realities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new Soviet leader will no doubt be cautious as he builds support. And he will share the general Russian view of Ronald Reagan as the most hostile American President in memory. He will have little incentive in foreign policy to take steps that would help Mr. Reagan win re-election - not, at least, unless and until Mr. Reagan looks a sure winner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The death of Yuri Andropov, in short, makes it even less likely that there can be any resolution this year of the major issues that divide the two superpowers. Indeed, meaningful negotiation on matters of substance is a remote prospect.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Must we, then, resign ourselves to Soviet-American relations continuing for the rest of this year at their present icy level, with hardly any communication between the dominant powers on earth? Is there nothing that can be suggested by way of hope?  No, it seems to me that there are some realistic possibilities in this political year. They are modest, as they must be in the circumstances. But they might open the way for efforts to work out the larger issues, most urgently arms control, next year.  One negative principle is important. This is not a time - if there ever is a time - when either side should undertake to put the other to a test.  At a minimum the two countries do not want the tensions between them to become more dangerous. In a period of political sensitivity, that means the Russians should avoid new geographical thrusts or provocations. It would be just as dangerous for the United States to take steps that look like deliberate challenges to the Soviet Union.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there is the affirmative possibility of signals: actions that may not themselves constitute a change in international policy but that suggest a desire to do diplomatic business. Here I think the crucial need now is for each side to signal a degree of respect for the other's concerns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the Soviet side, one human gesture would have a great effect on opinion in America and elsewhere in the West. That is to ease up on the repression of dissidents. The potent symbolic step would be to release the three most prominent victims of the repression: Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov and Anatoly Shcharansky.  Andrei Sakharov, the great physicist exiled to Gorky and harassed there by the K.G.B., wrote a letter to scientific colleagues in the Soviet Union and abroad that is published in the current New York Review of Books. It is a heart-rending document.  The Sakharov letter appeals for help in getting the Soviet authorities to let his wife, Elena Bonner, go abroad for medical treatment. She has had several heart attacks and has no way of getting proper care. In a further message dated Jan. 12, Mr. Sakharov said: ''Only a trip to receive medical treatment abroad can save her life, and mine as well, since her death would mean my death.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yuri Orlov, another physicist, was arrested seven years ago for setting up a committee to monitor Soviet compliance with the Helsinki agreements. He has reportedly been treated with special harshness in a labor camp at Perm. He was due for release from there this past Friday - but some experts fear that his term will be extended.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anatoly Shcharansky, an activist in both the human rights and Jewish emigration movements, has been in prison in Chistopol for nearly six years now. His mother saw him on Jan. 5 and said he was in severe pain from a heart condition and so emaciated that he was ''unrecognizable.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soviet leaders evidently do not understand what a terrible impact such cases have in the West - have specifically on the possibilities for negotiation. But there is an American failure of understanding, too. That is President Reagan's inability, if it is that, to appreciate the effect he creates in the Soviet Union by his bellicose and insulting rhetoric.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Malcolm Toon, U.S. Ambassador in Moscow from 1976 to 1979, is known for taking a tough line toward the Soviets. But when I talked with him after Mr. Andropov's death, he said essential business cannot be done with them if American rhetoric makes them think our aim is their destruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''For us as concerned Americans,'' Mr. Toon said, ''the important question is which is the real Reagan: the guy who made the awful 'evil empire' speech in Orlando? Or the one who made the speech in the White House last month, helpful but long overdue?  Frankly, I don't know which. And I think the Russians are confused - they don't really know if he's out to do them in.''</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is not mentioned.": "3"}, "stance": {"N/A (not enough information)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 52s "}}
