A greater proportion of white women than black women, however, participated in managerial and professional training.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Throughout most of the 1970s, black women who participated in job training programs tended to be disproportionately represented in clerical and semiskilled programs. They were consequently underrepresented in managerial and professional training programs. Our study results revealed, however, that participation in job training programs among black women eroded throughout the 1980s. As this cohort aged, black women participated less than white women in training programs. Despite this decline, however, we found no differences by type of training among participants in the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, our results pointed to good and bad news regarding women's participation in job training programs throughout a significant portion of their paid working histories. On one hand, job training segregation characteristic of the 1970s evaporated in the 1980s, as black women and white women were equally as likely to participate in clerical and semiskilled programs as they were in managerial and professional programs. On the other hand, equality of access to job training programs between white women and black women characteristic in the 1970s was undermined during the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, we also found that as these women matured, the intensity of the job training experience resulted in higher wages regardless of the duration of the program and independently of a participant's educational level and work history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We believe that these results can serve to inform the current debate regarding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. To the extent that job training increases income, thwarted access to such programs along racial lines remains problematic. Many business leaders have implemented <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs designed to increase diversity and to ensure that historical wrongs are addressed along lines of both race and gender. Our results suggest that human resource personnel still need to find ways to increase the accessibility of job training programs to black working women.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are not suggesting that access be denied to some at the expense of others. Rather, our view is one of expanding the job training pie, so to speak. That is, to the extent businesses want to attract qualified and diverse personnel, the provision of on-the-job training represents an investment in human capital with tangible rewards to their employees. That such investments also increase the bottom line is not in doubt. Employers can again ensure equal access to job training programs as was the case in the 1970s, and they can do so in light of the more equitable distributive gains between unskilled-semiskilled and managerial-professional training programs made in the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In regard to individual workers, our results suggest that on-the-job training is a worthwhile pursuit. Increasingly, technology makes today's skills outdated tomorrow. Lifelong learning is an ideal whose time has come. Skill acquisition can no longer be seen as fixed. Instead, individual workers will need to seek out ways to upgrade their skills, thereby demonstrating added value beyond that of accumulated wisdom that often accompanies accumulated experience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the future, greater economic rewards are likely to go to those whose competencies change to fit the organizational profile of a valued worker. Women will be very much a part of this workplace. They need to seek both on-the-job and off-the-job training opportunities that are necessary for advancement. Black women in particular must take proactive efforts to ensure access programs commensurate with their individual aspirations and abilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We also have a responsibility to serve as role models and coaches to the next generation of women preparing to enter the workforce. Women also must share their experiences with younger women through mentoring programs. Advocating that high school girls take extra mathematical, computer science and science courses will help to prepare them for the workplace of tomorrow. Encouraging young women to pursue college degrees and to take seriously the commitment to continuing education may help to diminish the job segregation that is still too commonplace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Businesses should see on-the-job training as investments in human capital that are mutually advantageous for themselves and their workers. Of particular importance is continuous learning for mid-career employees, who may be far removed from academic life per se. Rather than creating an environment that disposes of dependable, competent workers whose specific skills may be needed less as time goes on, employers can capitalize on known quantities by providing access to job training designed to meet the changing requirements of the job. In so doing, employers should judge performance in terms of competencies and avoid channeling women into stereotypic roles or roles narrowly associated with past work histories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lower access to training and over representation in clerical programs for black women may have channeled them into jobs not commensurate with their abilities. Black women remain the most underrepresented in managerial positions. Organizations in today's competitive market do not have the luxury to waste talent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study described in this article was published in the Human Resource Development Quarterly, Fall 1997 issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOS 2; Caption: PHOTOS: Mary Cianni is associate professor of management at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania and Richard K.

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 1s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398469346.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>A GOP star becomes 'one of them'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>William Weld instantly became a shining star in the Republican firmament when he succeeded Michael Dukakis as governor of Massachusetts in 1990, proving that a Republican could indeed win in the most liberal of states. Since then, Gov. Weld has tried to become a beacon for those outside the party mainstream by combining fiscal conservatism (complete with a \"no new taxes\" pledge) with social libertarianism (he's to the left of Joycelyn Elders on abortion). Now Gov. Weld has taken his most ambitious steps toward marketing his vision of Republicanism nationally by backing the presidential campaign of California Gov. Pete Wilson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But just as Gov. Weld tries to exert his influence beyond Massachusetts, he's losing his luster at home. Since winning reelection with more than 70% of the vote last fall, Gov. Weld has managed to alienate many of his core backers. In particular, many of the conservative Democrats who crossed party lines to support him -- the \"Weldocrats\" -- feel betrayed by a governor who reminds them more of Nelson Rockefeller than of Ronald Reagan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In December, Mr. Weld endured the most hostile public reaction of his career when he approved a thoroughly unpopular pay raise for state legislators. The Boston Herald filled page one with a derisive sketch of Mr. Weld as Santa, dropping presents down the State House chimney.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, Santa again sided with an unpopular special interest. State taxpayers are sick of the only-in-Massachusetts law which requires that off-duty cops be hired to oversee road work at twice the cost of regular flagmen. This mandate costs fiscally strapped cities and towns $100 million annually. But Mr. Weld ignored the mounting clamor for reform, saying, \"I'm with the cops on this one.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Barbara Anderson, a top antitax leader in the Bay State, has broken with Mr. Weld over such cave-ins. \"He's now become one of them,\" she says, \"sort of like the pod people.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the governor's credibility as a reformer has deteriorated to the point where the recent announcement of a new executive branch downsizing initiative was widely ridiculed as a publicity stunt. These days, Boston's radio talk shows are full of anti-Weld venom of the sort unheard since Mr. Dukakis left office. The governor's frequent out-of-town trips to raise funds for Mr. Wilson's campaign have become a local joke; one radio station even sent its morning team out in search of citizens who'd actually seen the governor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ultimate insult to the Weldocrats came on June 17, when Mr. Weld delivered a ringing endorsement of the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> status quo to stunned parents at graduation ceremonies for Northeastern University, a commuter school favored by working-class whites. \"We don't discard [the taxation or defense-procurement systems] when we see an individual application we don't like . . . because we understand the systems are there for a necessary purpose,\" reasoned Mr. Weld. \"Same goes for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For one former Weld campaign worker the speech was the final straw. \"The political culture he vowed to change instead changed him,\" he moans. \"When it comes to Bill Weld, effective term limits probably would have been one term.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What happened? Mr. Weld fancies himself a new strain of politically marketable Republican, his conservatism on taxes and crime made palatable for socially progressive baby boomers by his liberalism on abortion, gay rights, and environmental affairs. For a while, Mr. Weld's approach worked. He won general plaudits for cutting 7,000 state jobs and pushing for privatization of state services and a death penalty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with re-election safely in hand, the blue-blooded governor has revealed a palpable distaste for the indignities of populism and the impoliteness of the bully pulpit. He counts House Speaker Newt Gingrich as a friend, but has none of Mr. Gingrich's appetite for the grubby work of ideological leadership and party-building.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Weld won his party's nomination in 1990 despite opposition from its right-wing establishment, some of it quite nasty. Consequently, he ignored the party after taking office. Without leadership from atop, the GOP fared poorly in both the 1992 and 1994 legislative elections, dropping enough state Senate seats to lose the ability to sustain any Weld veto. One direct consequence was a successful Democratic override of Mr. Weld's 1993 veto of union-backed legislation bringing his privatization initiatives to a halt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candidate Weld regaled talk-radio audiences with tough talk on crime and his self-description as \"a filthy supply-sider.\" But Gov. Weld has done little to push supply-side tax cuts. The lone significant trophy, a five-year phase-out of the tax on long-term capital gains, was won not as the result of a public campaign extolling supply-side principles, but as a direct swap for the much-reviled legislators' pay hike. Public outrage over that bit of insider-trading flushed Mr. Weld out for a round of awkward damage-control attempts on the talk shows, where he seemed quite stunned at the near-unanimous disdain of Weldocrats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other areas, Mr. Weld's inside game has been even less successful. For instance, his cursory lobbying efforts have not yet led to the passage of a death penalty bill despite 80% support from the public. Republicans, such as the seven GOP representatives who deserted Mr. Weld on the capital punishment vote, feel little pressure from him to maintain party discipline; the Democrats increasingly see no reason to hide their contempt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rather than rub elbows with dreary legislators and demanding constituents, Mr. Weld seems to prefer the counsel of the legal and business cronies he cultivated during his years as a downtown lawyer and U.S. Attorney.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A 1990 campaign vow to remove televisions from state prison cells was quickly discarded under criticism from Democratic law enforcement officials and Mr. Weld's downtown friends. Among a panoply of conservative criminal-justice reforms promised by the candidate, only those with strong support within the Democratic establishment -- such as a long-overdue truth-in-sentencing law -- have materialized.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Weld won't dip into his political capital for a death penalty or serious tort reform, but he will risk Weldocrat goodwill by commuting the life-without-parole sentence of murderer Joseph Yandle, a Vietnam veteran whose supposedly impressive rehabilitation was sympathetically profiled on \"60 Minutes\" and has been a liberal cause celebre. Few Weldocrats need much prodding to recall Mr. Dukakis's furlough of vicious murderer-rapist Willie Horton. The question is: Does Mr. Weld remember?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Weldocrats find the governor increasingly oblivious to their agenda, liberal elites find him a receptive audience. Mr. Weld claims his lunge to the left on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> was prompted by a visit from Flash Wiley, an African-American businessman and longtime Democratic activist. \"They're old friends,\" said Mr. Weld of Mr. Wiley and his wife. \"When people like them say that when you're a minority contractor, you have to be twice as good, you've got to listen.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And what of the white Weldocrat contractors, shunted by the state's politically correct <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> policies to the back of the line for public contracts? \"I've listened to the claims and assertions for six months about this terrible resentment of white males, and I'm not buying it,\" Mr. Weld told the Boston Globe. \"These are phony assertions. The bottom line is that blacks are twice as unemployed as whites. You have a pretty crushing rationale [for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>] . . . and all the arguments against it you should disregard.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Weldocrats, like their counterparts nationally, are a brittle bunch. As both Bill Clinton and Ross Perot have discovered, their faith in the reformer of the moment is easily shattered. Mislead them on a crucial issue, as George Bush's lips did, and they begin to look elsewhere for hope. Mr. Weld offered the promise that the government would acknowledge their values and address their agony. Instead, his abandonment of them offers a warning to voters elsewhere about the integrity of new-age fusion Republicanism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Keller is a political analyst for WLVI-TV, Channel 56, in Boston.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat Against ": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 11s "}}

But personal relationships and an atmosphere of civility have clearly eroded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As I prepare for other pursuits after 24 years as a state legislator, I have reflected upon the changes that have occurred in the state Capitol. Some have been good but others do not bode well as California's policy choices become more difficult and contentious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the positive side, the public is more involved in influencing state policy today than when I started. The Internet makes legislative documents available for free. Cable television broadcasts live floor and committee sessions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also, the Legislature better reflects the diversity of California. When I first came to Sacramento, there were only two women and six Hispanic members among the 120 legislators; now 26 women and 20 Hispanic members serve in the Capitol, and the numbers are growing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One area that has not changed for the better is the personal relationships among legislators. This decline makes the job less enjoyable and makes it more difficult to agree on public policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I first came to Sacramento, legislators worked together by day and socialized by night. Sometimes we argued, but it was always done respectfully. I was friends with rural, conservative Republicans and they were friends with me, a liberal Democrat from Los Angeles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I would umpire softball games between the Senate and Assembly (I admit I threw a few calls to the more \"mature\" and \"deliberative\" Senate players.) Legislators would get together at the Derby Club, a lunch organization established in 1953. The club has a strict rule prohibiting discussion of legislative business so people can to know each other as human beings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Frank Fat's, a 60-year-old Chinese restaurant three blocks from the Capitol building, often was filled with legislators sharing a meal or drink.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today the atmosphere has changed. Years go by without a softball game. The Derby Club is ebbing because younger legislators have shown little interest in attending a weekly lunch. I see fewer legislators hanging out at Fat's.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Increasingly, members of the Legislature do not take the time to get to know one another on a personal level. Socializing with a member of the opposite party is almost considered an act of treason among some newer, more partisan members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The respectful courtesy that opponents once extended during floor debates has given way to petty bickering, personal insults and simplistic bombast.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several factors have contributed to the change. Public discourse generally has become more crass, corroded by television sound bites, shrill talk-radio hosts and candidates promising easy fixes to complex problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Term limits have short-circuited the ability of legislators to develop relationships that will last beyond the next election. An increased number of competitive legislative districts has raised the political stakes as each party vies for control of the two houses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whatever the reasons, the erosion of personal relationships hurts the Legislature's ability to deal with the difficult issues ahead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In my view, the deterioration of relationships in the Legislature contributed to the disturbing racial undertones of recent ballot measures concerning <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, bilingual education and illegal immigration. It was heartbreaking to see legislators from differing cultural or racial backgrounds debate these issues with an utter lack of sensitivity or understanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Politics has never been an avocation for the meek. It attracts people with healthy egos and strong opinions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under these conditions, it is essential for legislators to get to know one another personally, off hours, to discuss nonlegislative matters. Learn about families, hobbies and upbringing. Discover hopes and motivations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the most diverse society in human history and the most complicated state in the nation, California needs legislators who will work hard at developing harmony.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A good place to start is at lunch.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: Herschel Rosenthal</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Herschel Rosenthal is a Democrat who has represented portions of the San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Strongly In Favor": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 5s "}}

Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening, who assumed the leadership of the campus nearly two years ago, is getting ready to determine who will be on the Diversity Council and what it will do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The effort is worthwhile, and its timing could not be better. Last month a regent of the University of California, Ward Connerly, spoke out against <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in the community and said he would try to propose a method of ending race-based preferences in hiring and admissions. Although diversity and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> are not the same thing, they do tend to get tangled up in the oft-heated conversations on those topics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A consultant told UCI officials that the campus seems committed to diversity at the top and at the grass roots, but needs more support for the concept in the middle. That will be the job of the Diversity Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UCI has performed well off-campus in promoting diversity. One example was welcoming Fullerton high school students who wanted to learn more about people from different ethnic backgrounds. Those students then helped launch cultural diversity programs at their school. UCI graduates have been active in fostering diversity as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Huntington Beach, UCI graduate Alma L. Lopez has helped create a large mural at the art center that shows the various cultures in the county.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On campus too UCI has tried to blend students from varying backgrounds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its percentage of Asian students, 44%, is the largest in the University of California system. They benefit from events such as this month's 11th annual Asian Pacific Awareness Conference, which has the praiseworthy goal of explaining differences among the many cultures of Asia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, one area where the campus needs improvement is increasing the numbers of women and minorities it hires and promotes as faculty members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since arriving on campus, Wilkening has consistently said she believes UCI's diversity is an asset and a selling point. Those beliefs resonate in the community as well. Last year the Orange County Annual Survey found that nearly four out of five residents said the county needed programs to increase dialogue among ethnic groups. That was a realistic assessment of the need for all residents to get along in an increasingly diverse Orange County.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 21s "}}

Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater's political skills abandoned him recently when he participated in a racial dialogue that pointedly excluded whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's town meeting in Akron last week was fumbling and lacking focus. Mr. Clinton was snappish with one of the few prominent dissident voices and overstated the case when he declared that Colin Powell got to his exalted rank in the Army because of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this still is a very worthwhile effort. America has fumbled, and worse, on race for 250 years. Thus it's hardly surprising that a reasonably ambitious effort for addressing this festering American malady would encounter early trouble.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, this is a departure for President Clinton, who too often has focused on the small-bore, politically easy agenda items that his former political strategist, the infamous Dick Morris, so cheaply champions. But race is not small bore or easy. There's not only a risk that this won't succeed, but given the history, the odds are that it won't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometimes it's easy to forget that a little over 30 years ago, there were precious few blacks in the executive suites, newsrooms or political corridors; it was commonplace for African-Americans to be excluded from public accommodations and even the vote, and that throughout much of the South, drinking fountains were marked \"colored\" or \"white.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet for all the extraordinary progress over these past three decades, race remains an excruciating American dilemma. That's why the multifaceted Clinton initiative is as commendable as it is complex.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael K. Frisby reported in this newspaper last week that the White House is bringing the advisory committee on race back firmly under its control. New proposals, with a focus on youth, are being hatched in time for the January State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And there is far more sensitivity to the rap that this has been a one-sided dialogue excluding many conservatives or critics of controversial ideas like <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Next Wednesday, the advisory committee will meet with prominent conservative Bill Bennett. Two days later, President Clinton will meet with Jack Kemp and, probably, Ward Connerly, who led California's successful anti<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> ballot initiative last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, the specter of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hangs over this discussion. Americans are sharply divided over granting selective preferences to minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is seen as quotas or rigid preferences, particularly in school admissions or hiring and promotion, Americans are overwhelmingly opposed. If it is seen as opening up, assuring and even fostering equal opportunities, the public is solidly for it. The problem is that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has been all of the above.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In two of the most publicized votes, Californians by 54% to 46% voted down <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> on the state level a year ago. By the same margin, voters in Houston last month voted to continue that city's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program. In both cases, the opposing side argued the decision was stacked or the wording of the referendum was flawed; in fact, both votes are very indicative of where America is.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This was evident in the highly publicized incident at the president's town meeting in Akron, Ohio, last week. He asked author and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> critic Abigail Thernstrom if she wanted to end the type of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs that promoted Colin Powell in the Army. This issue and exchange has been seized upon by both sides with considerably more heat than light.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, according to Clifford Alexander, who was Secretary of the Army when Gen. Powell became a general, the promotion board came back with a paucity of minority candidates. He simply sent them back to see if other candidates could be found; Colin Powell was in the next group. \"This was not an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program,\" Mr. Alexander says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's absurd to suggest that the army -- or almost any other institution that has successfully integrated in recent years -- has followed the laissez-faire approach that abandons all remnants of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which is now espoused by many conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One good example is the U.S. Military Academy. West Point now sets a \"class composition goal\" of 7% to 9% African-American cadets every year. The last two incoming classes have been about 7.5% black. These goals are achieved by sending promising young African-Americans to the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School for a year to get them up to West Point standards. Overall, 14% of West Point's cadets attended this military prep school, but 37% of its African-Americans did. That is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, recognizing that there isn't a level playing field.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill Republicans are pushing in Congress would outlaw nonbinding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> goals, which would do away with much of what the Army and West Point are now achieving. That's why even some conservative African-Americans, like Rep. J.C. Watts (R., Okla.), urge caution before dismantling existing programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one has navigated this tightrope better than Gen. Powell. In his autobiography, he wrote that \"preferential\" treatment \"demeans\" achievement, but where discrimination has existed \"it is only fair to provide temporary means\" to catch up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week in an interview, Mr. Powell says the issue has nothing do with him but rather with where we are as a society and what works. \"Some of my friends take only the first part of what I wrote and conclude, `see, he's against preferences.' But that was very difficult to write and I nuanced it very carefully. We had a preference system for over 200 years that did not include black people.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What is essential now, he says, \"is to get away from the inflammatory stuff that shuts down dialogue. Let's stop saying that everyone on one side is a racist. Let's stop saying that all preferences are bad when we live in a system of preferences. We go to court over preferences if someone is black but not if they get a preference because their parents went to that school.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If President Clinton's initiative can help tame such inflammatory rhetoric, that alone will be a useful exercise.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 1s "}}

Democrat Bill Clinton continues to appeal to about the same 43% of the electorate that voted for him in 1992. On the Republican side, Sens. Bob Dole and Phil Gramm are running hard, along with a roomful of hopefuls struggling for national recognition. But so far none of these candidacies is drawing many oohs and ahs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This lack of excitement about what the two major parties have to offer is not new to U.S. presidential politics; today as before, the disenchantment has something to do with the personalities of the candidates. But on a more fundamental level it reflects a darkening mood among Americans. The growing distrust of the professional political class, the frustration with the simplistic nostrums peddled by the ideological left and right alike, the feeling that the political procedure has gone awry--all have left many voters unhappy with both the governing process and the choices they sense will be presented next year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which brings us to Colin Powell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LOOK OF A LEADER: The retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has begun a multi-city tour to promote his newly published memoirs. Inescapably, this commercial enterprise bodes to become indistinguishable from a national political progression. For at this stage in his life, Powell--articulate, intelligent, experienced in Washington politics and in global affairs, a true American success story--can accurately be called charismatic. Ready or not, he is about to become an object of the closest political scrutiny. In our current political culture, with its deficit of leadership, Powell has the look of a leader about him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He says he will make a decision on his future in the next few months. Only now is he beginning to outline his views on domestic issues. He prefers adoption to abortion but supports a woman's right to choose. A gun owner, he favors gun control. He supports some <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. He opposes mandatory prayer in the schools but supports moments of silence. All this seems to place him in the broad, moderate middle--not an ideal place for anyone hoping to get the nomination at the 1996 GOP convention. If Powell is truly thinking about presidential politics, that thinking may well lie outside the two-party system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TWO KEY FACTORS: The huge difficulty in running for the presidency without the support of a national party organization doesn't necessarily mean that such a campaign is impossible. Two things right now promote a Powell candidacy. The first is voter interest in having another choice, an alternative to what the two parties may offer. The other is the perceived strength of Powell's character.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's always possible the Powell bubble will burst in a few months. It's also possible that he just may be the instrument to re-energize a public fed up with the nastiness, the phoniness and the cynicism of politics.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 25s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1652232593.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>The Best Way to Address Campus Rape</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE campus rape debate took another hairpin turn last week when The Daily Beast published an interview with Paul Nungesser, the Columbia student accused of raping a fellow student, Emma Sulkowicz. She has been carrying a mattress around the campus to raise awareness about sexual assault and to protest the school's failure to expel Mr. Nungesser, who was cleared by a campus tribunal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The article raised questions about her story; among other things, it included screen shots from Mr. Nungesser's Facebook account showing that he and Ms. Sulkowicz had traded mutually affectionate messages for weeks after the incident in question.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response, the Columbia Daily Spectator published two columns wondering whether the paper had been too quick to assume Mr. Nungesser's guilt. Ms. Sulkowicz's supporters and some bloggers denounced The Daily Beast for conducting a trial by media and for posting the Facebook pages, which they said added nothing to the story unless you believed that a rape survivor who didn't behave like the perfect victim had to be a liar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the media has reason to retry the case. Ms. Sulkowicz herself sought out the media when Columbia exonerated Mr. Nungesser. And the media made Ms. Sulkowicz so well known as a rape survivor that Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, invited her to the State of the Union address and publicly declared that she had received \"no justice.\" Very few people, and almost no one in the media, thought to question that assertion, because everyone knows, just knows, that you can't trust a campus sexual assault proceeding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What explains the nearly universal lack of confidence in these proceedings? Universities share some of the blame, but there's another culprit too: the United States government. People often wonder why college administrators try to adjudicate these fiendishly difficult cases, rather than putting them in the hands of the criminal justice system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason is that the Department of Education has very forcefully told schools to handle sexual grievances themselves and given them very detailed instructions about how to do so. A report last year from a White House task force on campus sexual assault underscored the importance to a university of following that advice. Even though the D.O.E.'s instructions are presented as recommendations rather than law, its Office for Civil Rights can put any school that fails to follow them on the list of colleges under investigation and even take away its federal funding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no doubt that on many occasions colleges have not treated sexual-assault accusations as seriously as they should have. Nor did they do enough to ensure that women felt completely safe on campus. But in the past half-decade, the civil rights office has tried so hard to correct that problem that it is now forcing schools to go too far in the other direction, which has made campus procedures seem even less credible. Schools are being told to disregard what most Americans think of as the basic civil rights of a person accused of a heinous act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among other things, schools have to determine guilt on the basis of a \"preponderance of\" rather than \"clear and convincing\" evidence -- that is, on a 51 percent likelihood that the man did it, rather than a 75 percent one. (In these cases, the accused is almost always a man, although the accuser is by no means always a woman.) Neither party is allowed to cross-examine the other, lest direct questioning re-traumatize a victim. Schools must resolve cases swiftly -- the original requirement was 60 days, though the latest guidelines leave out the number and simply stress the need for a prompt resolution -- even if a criminal investigation is going forward at a slower pace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That puts a student who wants to defend himself at risk of saying things that could later be used against him in court -- and at many schools, he's not even allowed to let a lawyer speak for him. At least 30 male students, some of whom were suspended or expelled for sexual misconduct, have filed suits against their universities, claiming that the process was unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What should universities do to convince the world that they're fit to deal with campus rape? First, they should band together and demand that the government rethink its guidelines, especially those that flout the key tenets of due process. Second, they should ask the Office for Civil Rights to clarify its notion of sexual misconduct, now left to each school to define. Is it rape if a man fails to get affirmative consent at every stage of a sexual interaction, or only if he ignores a spoken objection? If a man and a woman are equally drunk, should he be found guilty of assaulting her because she was too intoxicated to agree to sex, even though he himself may have been too drunk to know that? (Right now, at most schools, he would be considered guilty.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, universities should insist that determinations of guilt or innocence rely on a \"reasonable-person test,\" according to which the accused is only culpable if a reasonable person would have considered his actions to be wrong. Without that standard, his fate may rest on her subjective judgment -- if she feels that he imposed unwanted sexual contact on her, no matter what he actually did, then he can be found to have harassed or raped her. (Harvard's controversial new policy leaves out the reasonable-person standard, which is partly why 28 of its law professors have publicly objected to it.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fourth step, however, may be the most important. Though schools have the right to uphold their own standards of conduct, the government is currently scaring them into creating big, expensive bureaucracies and designing unduly cumbersome policies. Meanwhile, there are many more 18- to 25-year-old rape victims outside the walls of colleges than inside them. The smarter and more public-spirited thing for schools to do would be to divert at least some of their time and energy to forming partnerships with local law enforcement agencies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is widely believed that the police are insensitive to rape victims. Universities, on the whole, have a great deal of clout in their communities; they also possess considerable intellectual resources. They could be helping policemen and prosecutors do a better job with sexual violence cases instead of squandering money and good will on their own all-too-easily second-guessed shadow justice systems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JUDITH SHULEVITZ   Judith Shulevitz is the author of \"The Sabbath World: Glimpses of a Different Order of Time.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia University, On Friday.

Its answer, with some important caveats, has always been yes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was wise to reaffirm this principle on Thursday, ruling 4 to 3 in favor of an admissions process at the University of Texas at Austin that weighs race as one of many factors in filling some spots in its first-year class. The decision was the strongest reaffirmation of the constitutionality of a race-conscious approach in more than a decade, and should be the defining judgment on this issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court has acknowledged over and over that universities have a compelling interest in achieving the social and educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body. But that precedent has remained under constant attack. The current case was brought by Abigail Fisher, a white woman who was denied admission in 2008 and argued that the university violated the Constitution's equal protection clause by discriminating against white applicants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Texas uses two separate methods to achieve greater diversity: First, it automatically offers roughly three-quarters of its spots to students who graduated in the top 10 percent of every high school in the state. (This helps increase diversity because so many Texas high schools are either overwhelmingly white or minority.) The remaining quarter is filled using a \"holistic\" process that considers various factors, including an applicant's leadership qualities, talents, socioeconomic status and race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, rejected Ms. Fisher's arguments and said, \"Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Justice Kennedy cautioned that a university's goals \"must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them,\" and that officials must continue to monitor and change those policies if necessary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(Only seven justices participated in the ruling. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself because of her prior involvement in the litigation as solicitor general; Justice Antonin Scalia, who heard oral arguments in the case in December, died in February.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court considered Texas' holistic approach once before, in 2013, but declined then to rule on its constitutionality. Instead, it sent the case back to the federal appeals court to examine more closely the university's rationale for considering race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That type of examination is exactly what the university did, in providing data showing that race-neutral policies were inadequate in achieving a diverse student body, and that the holistic approach made a significant difference. In fact, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, the university has been adjusting its use of race in admissions for 20 years. It developed its current approach in direct response to a 2003 Supreme Court ruling upholding the same process at the University of Michigan law school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some justices continue to reject any consideration of race in college admissions. Justice Clarence Thomas dismissed the idea that students benefit from a racially diverse learning environment as a \"fchangeish theory.\" Justice Samuel Alito spent 50 pages -- more than twice the length of the majority opinion -- disputing every rationale offered by the university and its supporters. \"This is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> gone wild,\" he wrote, and argued that the top 10 percent plan produced enough diversity on its own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that plan, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a dissent from the 2013 decision, is itself race conscious, since it relies on the existing and extreme segregation of Texas high schools. The holistic approach, on the other hand, considers race as a \"factor of a factor of a factor of a factor.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some insist simplistically that America is already a colorblind society or, even more perversely, that ending race-conscious policies would lead the way to such a society. Fortunately, Justice Kennedy, who has long  been a strong skeptic of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs, rejected that view. His vote in the Fisher case assures that universities will continue to have the right to shape their student bodies in a way that better reflects today's America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: THE EDITORIAL BOARD</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Drawing by Lisk Feng)</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}

But the average Black man in America lives about five fewer years than the average white man. A newborn Black boy in Washington, D.C., has a shorter life expectancy than a newborn boy in India.One of the challenges for those of us in journalism is to do a better job highlighting these inequities that don't come with a viral video.Since Floyd's death, we've focused on racial inequities in the criminal justice system, and it has been easy for liberal white Americans -- my tribe -- to feel indignant and righteous while blaming others. But in some areas, such as an unjust education system, we are part of the problem.At the very time that America was having a racial reckoning about criminal justice, Democratic states were closing in-person schooling in ways that particularly harmed nonwhite students. Race gaps increased, according to research by McKinsey & Company, and a Federal Reserve study suggests that higher dropout rates for marginalized students will have long-term consequences.More broadly, we in the United States embrace a public education system based on local financing that ensures that poor kids go to poor schools and rich kids to rich schools.Yes, it's a \"public\" school system with \"free\" education. So anyone who can afford a typical home in Palo Alto, Calif., costing $3.2 million, can then send children to superb schools. And less than 2 percent of Palo Alto's population is Black.Rucker Johnson, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that since 1988, American public schools have become more racially segregated. Roughly 15 percent of Black and Hispanic students attend so-called apartheid schools with fewer than 1 percent white students.In 1973, the Supreme Court came a whisker from overturning this system of unequal school funding, in the case of Rodriguez v. San Antonio Independent School District. Lower courts had ruled that profoundly unequal school funding violated the Constitution, but by a 5-to-4 vote the justices disagreed.This was the Brown v. Board of Education case that went the other way. If a single justice had switched, America would today be a fairer and more equitable nation.Educated white Americans are now repulsed at the thought of systems of separate and unequal drinking fountains for Black Americans but seem comfortable with a Jim Crow financing system resulting in unequal schools for Black children -- even though schools are far more consequential than water fountains.Perhaps that's because we and our children have a stake in this unequal system. Similarly, we accept that elite universities offer legacy preferences that amount to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for highly privileged children, with bonus consideration for big donors. This is one reason some universities have more students from the richest 1 percent than from the poorest 60 percent.Likewise, wealthy white Americans benefit from single-family zoning laws in the suburbs around those fine \"public\" schools. The effect of this zoning is to freeze out low-income families and keep neighborhoods more segregated.Then there's our skewed tax system: The I.R.S. is more likely to audit impoverished Americans who use the earned-income tax credit and typically earn less than $20,000 than it is to audit people earning $400,000. The county in the United States with the highest audit rate, according to ProPublica, is Humphreys County, Miss., which is impoverished and three-quarters Black.So how do we address these root inequities?We don't have perfect solutions, but many programs promote opportunity and reduce race gaps over time. The time to start is early childhood, with home visiting, quality child care and pre-K. Baby bonds can reduce wealth gaps, and child tax credits cut child poverty. Job training and a higher minimum wage can help families. Many of these elements are in President Biden's three-part proposal to invest in America and Americans, with the goal of reducing child poverty in America by half.One paradox is that while liberals often advocate such measures as ways to reduce racial inequality, polling suggests that this framing actually reduces public support. The best way to win support for these progressive policies, research suggests, is to frame them as reducing class gaps, not race gaps.Back in the early 2000s, white Americans sometimes said in polls that antiwhite bias was a bigger problem than anti-Black bias. That was delusional, and the tumult following the Floyd case increased the share of whites who acknowledge that discrimination persists.So the Floyd case may represent a milestone of progress in criminal justice. Now can America leverage this recognition of unfairness and inequity into other spheres, such as our still segregated education system?The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.
