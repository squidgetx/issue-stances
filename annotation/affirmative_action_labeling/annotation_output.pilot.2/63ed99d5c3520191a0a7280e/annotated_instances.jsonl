There is, of all things, intelligence. Bush is, on one level, no toy rocket scientist. \"Is our children learning?\" he asked during the campaign. Oh, they is, but not, we hope, grammar from you, sir. As it happens, the level on which Bush is not intellectually impressive is the only one that most journalists respect: verbal intelligence, the ability to understand and manipulate logic and language. This is precisely the sort of intelligence Bush does not possess, and so, many journalists stupidly thought of Bush as, well, stupid. I include myself in this and hereby renounce and regret my repeated past use, in connection with Bush, of the word \"pinhead.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Bush does possess is political intelligence -- the ability to understand and manipulate people and situations. Verbal intelligence and political intelligence are not necessarily connected: Think of the Mayor Daleys, father and son. It appears that this is so with Bush. The best evidence of this is that he has shown a grasp of the same essential dynamic of politics that brought success to his immediate predecessor -- the dynamic of triangulation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Bill Clinton knew and what it seems Bush knows is that there are three groups of voters: a core who will vote for you if, and only if, you satisfy their nonnegotiable ideological demands; a contrapuntal anti-core, whom you can never win over but whom you may discourage; and swing voters. To win, you must satisfy the core, blunt the drive and reach of the anti-core and make yourself minimally acceptable to a majority of the swing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obvious, of course, but in practice, not so. Clinton brilliantly grasped the subtleties of the thing. He understood that (a) the core's nonnegotiable needs were actually very few; meet those needs absolutely and always and the core would grant you vast leeway on every other issue; (b) the post-'60s Democratic Party, forgetting this, had assumed all sorts of demands to be nonnegotiable and had thereby saddled itself with all sorts of unpopular positions (in areas such as welfare, crime and use of military force); thus (c) making it impossible for it to win a majority of the swing. So Clinton made himself the unwavering champion of his core's nonnegotiables (<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, unfettered abortion, identity group representation in the distribution of power and perks). Everything else he threw up for grabs, and in the process threw away all the bad old issues that kept Democrats marginalized, and won back the swing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bush is now doing the same thing in reverse. Like Clinton, Bush knows that he must satisfy his core's nonnegotiables; he has moved unwaveringly to do this, most importantly on abortion and on taxes. Like Clinton, he knows that most of the swings want a nondivisive, \"nice\" president, and that giving ground on contentious issues will please the swing, weaken the standing of the anti-core and be tolerated by the core.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider Bush's support for an end to racial profiling in law enforcement. The core might regard that as giving in to race demagoguery, but it doesn't regard this as a nonnegotiable. To Bush's anti-core, though, racial profiling is a vital concern -- in fact, a nonnegotiable. The swings, meanwhile, just don't want to waste time and energy fighting about the thing. Thus, with one move, Bush's administration weakened its anti-core, which is depending heavily on selling the canard of Bush as a racist president, and pleased the swing, while not losing the slightest support with its core.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is politics played on a high and nuanced plane of intelligence, the sort of level that signifies a natural ability -- natural political smarts.

Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat Against ": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 23s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/432419685.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>A Moderate Term on the Court</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Th' supreme coort,'' Mr. Dooley famously observed, ''follows th' iliction returns.'' A century after Finley Peter Dunne's fictional Irish saloonkeeper made the point, the court has put an interesting spin on Mr. Dooley's theory. At a time when President Bush and his Republican majority in Congress are continually arguing that they have the mandate to appoint extreme conservatives to the federal bench, the highest court of all has surprised many people with its moderation. The Supreme Court, it appears, is better at reading the election returns than some elected politicians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservative legal groups had high hopes that the nine justices -- seven of whom were appointed by Republican presidents -- would issue a landmark ruling this term striking down <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joining the court's most liberal members in a 5-to-4 vote, upheld the University of Michigan's use of race in admissions. By endorsing the consideration of race, but barring quotas and rigid formulas, the court essentially ratified an existing national consensus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the term's other blockbuster decision, the court ruled 6 to 3 that gay sexual relations are constitutionally protected. In doing so, it erased one of its own worst precedents, the 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, and struck an important blow for gay rights generally. And it brought the law in line with evolving popular opinion, which now solidly holds that private consensual sex should be legal, and that gays should not be subject to discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court surprised the legal community by halting, or at least pausing in, its aggressive states' rights crusade. Until this term the conservative majority, led by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, had been steadily whittling away at Americans' rights under federal law. It struck down the Violence Against Women Act on ''federalism'' grounds, and held that the nation's 4.8 million state employees are only partly protected by federal disability and age discrimination laws. But this term the court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, rejected a federalism claim and held that state workers are fully protected by the Family and Medical Leave Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, the court's inclination to stick to the mainstream meant it did an uneven job of protecting the marginalized from the excesses of the majority. The court callously turned away a challenge to California's ''three strikes'' law by a man who was given a sentence of 50 years to life for stealing $150 worth of videotapes from Kmart. Justice O'Connor, whose status as the court's critical swing vote was solidified this year, provided the majority with its fifth vote in that case. But she was also the swing vote to uphold Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts, a vital source of funds for legal services for the poor nationwide that was challenged by conservative legal groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This term showed just how far right the court's three most conservative members are. The dissent in the gay sex case -- by the chief justice, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -- fulminated, like a talk show rant, about a ''homosexual agenda.'' But there is no equivalent core of justices on the left trying to push beyond the legal expression of mainstream American thought. No justice wrote separately to say the principles the court laid down offer support for gay marriage. On subjects from civil rights to criminal law, the ideological spectrum ranges from the far right on one side to liberal centrism on the other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The final week of the session, when the decisions on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and the sodomy law came down, are sure to energize right-wing activists, who were already upset with the court's moderation and vowing to fill the next vacancy with another Justice Scalia or Justice Thomas. An extreme choice for a single slot could have a profound impact on American life -- limiting the ability of the federal government to protect the environment, and ending <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and, perhaps, abortion rights. The court's performance over the last nine months was not perfect, but it generally reflected the best instincts of the American people. The Senate, and public, must not allow this to change.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 46s "}}

So, consider the constitutionally dubious conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's three murderers for having committed \"hate crimes.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The criminal justice system has now correctly concluded that his murderers were racists whose racism manifested itself in their actions. This conclusion, however, does not justify complacency about deciding that because the killers' gross acts reflected grotesque thinking, the thinking merits its own punishment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The killers chased Arbery \u2014 a Black jogger in a White neighborhood \u2014 and killed him with a shotgun. For this violation of Georgia's law against murder, a state court sentenced them to life imprisonment. Then this week, they were convicted in a federal court of violating a federal law that punishes those who violate a person's civil rights \"because of\" their \"race, color,\" etc. For this they can again be sentenced to life in prison.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Jacob Sullum, senior editor of Reason, notes: It is therefore \"equally true that the defendants were convicted 'because of' their benighted beliefs. Condemning them as bigots was the whole point of this exercise, since they had already been condemned (and punished) as murderers.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This misuse of judicial proceedings was, Sullum says, possible because of two regrettable Supreme Court conclusions: The killers' \"second, symbolic prosecution did not amount to double jeopardy, because the state and federal crimes, defined by two different 'sovereigns,' are not 'the same offense.'\" And prosecutions of hate crimes are deemed consistent with the First Amendment, even if they impose added punishment for speech that, however scabrous, is nevertheless constitutionally protected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, the government can conduct trials for the purpose of virtue signaling \u2014 to announce, however redundantly, that it condemns particular frames of mind. A bigot's shabby mental furniture is, however, not a crime. Were it, what other mentalities might government decide to stigmatize by imposing special punishments? Arbery's killers had expressed their racism in speech (texts, social media posts, remarks) that no jurisdiction can proscribe. But their federal punishment will be imposed precisely because their speech demonstrated their bigotry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Proving the intent behind a criminal act is crucial. And no principle should prohibit ever making punishment proportional to the motive for a criminal act. However, deciding that an actor's heinous behavior is made more heinous because they had a bad attitude is dangerous. It is one thing for the law to hold individuals responsible for controlling their minds, which presumably control their bodies. It is quite another thing for government to inventory an individual's mind for the purpose of declaring how admirable the government's mind is, and perhaps by doing so to improve the public's mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This impulse melds with what C.S. Lewis called the remedial theory of punishment, whereby government detains offenders until they are cured, as determined by government's \"official straighteners.\" Another totalitarian temptation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only an engaged judiciary vigorously applying constitutional protections prevents the woke from greasing this nation's slide into something like Europe's increasingly minute supervision of speech \u2014 and of the mentalities speech reflects. The European Court of Human Rights says governments may \"sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred.\" By \"even prevent,\" the ECHR evidently extends permission for preemptive censorship and punishment. Based on what?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In today's America, \"hate speech\" has become an elastic concept stretched to encompass any expression of ideas \u2014 e.g., opposition to race-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> or saying marriage should be between a man and a woman \u2014 that offends any of the plethora of easily offended factions. So, various colleges and universities have proscribed speech that might \"annoy or otherwise inconvenience\" anyone, and certain \"attitudes,\" and \"verbal harm\" from injurious \"assumptions\" or \"implications.\" They have guaranteed \"freedom from indignity of any type\" and protection from \"patronizing remarks.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congressional grandstanding includes the promiscuous multiplication of federal crimes, many of them duplicative of state crimes. From Congress's bottomless moral pork barrel comes proposals for niche hate crime legislation: The latest, the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, was signed into law May 20 last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Government is failing conspicuously at many basic things \u2014 budgeting, preserving the currency's value, maintaining infrastructure, educating children, etc. Surely government should economize its exertions by not conducting show trials for the purpose of highlighting \u2014 perhaps for the public's moral improvement \u2014 that it is offended by certain thinking that can precede certain behaviors that are already criminalized and forcefully punished.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is not mentioned.": "3"}, "stance": {"N/A (not enough information)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 43s "}}

Move to Hawaii</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The \u201caloha spirit\u201d may hold a deep lesson for all of us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HONOLULU \u2014 Kristin Pauker still remembers her uncle\u2019s warning about Dartmouth. \u201cIt\u2019s a white institution,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to feel out of place.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker, who is now a psychology professor, is of mixed ancestry, her mother of Japanese descent and her father white from an Italian-Irish background. Applying to colleges, she was keen to leave Hawaii for the East Coast, eager to see something new and different. But almost immediately after she arrived on campus in 1998, she understood what her uncle had meant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She encountered a barrage of questions from fellow students. What was her ethnicity? Where was she from? Was she Native Hawaiian? The questions seemed innocent on the surface, but she sensed that the students were really asking what box to put her in. And that categorization would determine how they treated her. \u201cIt opened my eyes to the fact that not everyone sees race the same way,\u201d she told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in Hawaii, being mixed was so common as to be nearly unremarkable. Many of her friends were some mixture of East Asian ethnicities, white, Filipino, Hawaiian and more, and for the most part, everyone hung out with everyone else. The Dartmouth student body, on the other hand, seemed self-segregated. The nonwhite students primarily stuck with their own race \u2014 blacks sat with blacks in the cafeteria, Asians with Asians, Native Americans with Native Americans. (Dartmouth, which was around 75 percent white then, has since doubled its share of nonwhite students.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the first time in her life, she wasn\u2019t sure where she belonged, and she found herself wondering: Does it have to be like this?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few years later, as a graduate student in psychology at Tufts, she began her first study probing that question. Psychologists argue that \u201cessentialist\u201d thinking \u2014 ideas about human beings\u2019 unchangeable essence, their inherent inferiority or the threat they supposedly pose \u2014 makes racism possible. Dr. Pauker wanted to know when children started expressing essentialist views of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She found that between ages 4 and 11, upper-middle-class children from mostly white neighborhoods around Boston increasingly viewed race as a permanent condition and expressed stereotypes about other racial groups: that blacks were aggressive or, on the flip side, good at basketball; that Asians were submissive and good at math. These children came from public schools in liberal areas. They probably weren\u2019t deliberately taught these stereotypes at home. But they absorbed them from the American ether nonetheless.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Would children in Hawaii express the same views? Dr. Pauker repeated the study with middle- and upper-middle-class grade-school students in and around Honolulu, and was not entirely surprised to find that in Hawaii, the children, including those who were white, tended not to express the same essentialist ideas about race. They were not race-blind. They recognized skin color, hair texture and other features commonly associated with race. But they did not attribute to race the inherent qualities \u2014 aggression or book smarts \u2014 that their mainland brethren did. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe that race was biological,\u201d Dr. Pauker told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She had a hypothesis to explain the difference. Whites dominated in the Boston area schools, but were a minority in Hawaii, and always had been. Hawaii also had the highest percentage of mixed-race people by a long shot in the country. (Among them was our first mixed-race president, Barack Obama, who was born there.) Mixed-race people, who make up nearly a quarter of Hawaii\u2019s population of 1.4 million, serve as a kind of jamming mechanism for people\u2019s race radar, Dr. Pauker thinks. Because if you can\u2019t tell what people are by looking at them \u2014 if their very existence blurs the imagined boundaries between supposedly separate groups \u2014 then race becomes a less useful way to think about people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I\u2019m interested in all of this partly because I myself come from a mixed background. I have an Ashkenazi Jewish father and a Puerto Rican mother (neither of which, I should point out, is a race). I first came across Dr. Pauker some years ago while researching mixed-race identity formation. The question of how people from mixed backgrounds create their identity has, until recently, mostly been ignored by psychologists. The assumption has been that mixed-race people likely have a difficult time because they\u2019re from (at least) two cultures but inhabit a world that often requires total allegiance to one group or another. And there\u2019s some truth to this. Researchers have documented how the unique challenges encountered by mixed people can, depending on the social context, negatively affect their mental health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Dr. Pauker belongs to a small group of psychologists, many of them mixed themselves, who have begun to explore the advantages of being multiracial. For instance, Sarah Gaither at Duke, a frequent collaborator of Dr. Pauker\u2019s, has discovered that, when reminded of their multiracial heritage, mixed-race individuals score higher on tests that measure creativity. This is probably not because they are inherently superior in some way, but because the very thing that\u2019s so difficult for them \u2014 the need to navigate multiple worlds \u2014 may actually enhance mental flexibility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Plenty of research indicates that diversity has many benefits. Diverse groups are better at problem-solving; in mock trials, diverse juries give fairer verdicts; diverse companies are more profitable; researchers argue that diverse countries have stronger economies. And the United States is not only becoming more diverse, it\u2019s also growing more mixed. Mixed-race people are among the fastest-growing segments of the population \u2014 between 2.6 percent and 6.9 percent of the population, depending on the study. By 2060, the segment is projected to double.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet, at the same time, we seem to be in the throes of a backlash against diversity, against mixing, with many people trying to claw their way back to a largely mythical, more homogeneous past. Could Hawaii show us another way forward? I flew there to find out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One day, I sat down under an enormous tree on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus and tried to count the people I saw walking with companions of different racial backgrounds. One of Dr. Pauker\u2019s arguments about what makes Hawaii special is that people have numerous cross-group acquaintances. Forty percent end up marrying someone from outside their own group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The campus was clearly diverse, but I quickly realized the assumption underlying my fieldwork was fatally flawed. Here I was trying to discern ancestry, but how was I to know anyone\u2019s background just by looking, particularly in a place where people were so mixed?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My gaffe got me musing about the many assumptions we inherit about race without really thinking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the more pernicious myths to take root in the modern mind is that racism is human nature, that it\u2019s an inevitable part of who we are, a product of our evolution. You\u2019ve probably heard the argument. We\u2019re group animals. We instinctually divide the world into \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d Groups compete with one another. They invariably enter into conflict. Even chimpanzee \u201ctribes\u201d wage war with one another, after all. We\u2019re thus doomed to look down on people we\u2019re not familiar with \u2014 to \u201cotherize,\u201d in modern academic jargon, those who don\u2019t look or speak like us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In reality, this is only part of the story. In the 1960s, the social psychologist Marilynn Brewer tested the idea that human cultures naturally divided the world into in-groups and out-groups, and that they instinctually despised people who were unfamiliar. She and her colleagues conducted interviews with people in 19 non-Western cultures. Yes, some were hostile to other groups. But many actually respected and admired them. Their attitude was, to quote one respondent, \u201cWe have our ways and they have their ways.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe assumption that groups are competitive, that out-group hate is a correlate of in-group love, that it\u2019s built on our evolution as a social species \u2014 it\u2019s just not true,\u201d Dr. Brewer told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea of race as an essential aspect of one\u2019s personhood didn\u2019t always dominate, even in the West. Some ancient Greeks ascribed human differences in skin tone and hair texture to climate, an idea that\u2019s similar to the modern scientific understanding of the variation that underlies what we call race. That doesn\u2019t mean that the Greeks saw all humans as equal. They had plenty of slaves. Women were second-class citizens. And they divided the world into Greek, or civilized, and barbarian. Being civilized was clearly superior. But being barbarian wasn\u2019t an inescapable condition, the way many would come to think of race in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Centuries later, the Romans had a similar view, dividing people not by skin color, but by whether they were Romanized or non-Romanized. Again, these differences were not seen as inherent. The Romanized Gauls used to be like the non-Romanized Germans, Julius Caesar observed during his military campaigns in Western and Central Europe. People could change. A Celt or Egyptian who moved to Rome would, you\u2019d expect, become just as Roman as the next guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When did this more flexible understanding of race begin to harden? Some historians point to the 14th century as a turning point. Until then, Jews in Europe had some legal rights. But in 1348, the plague struck. Many believed that the Jews were responsible; they began to move away from the view that Jews were people who merely had a different religion and toward the idea that they were inherently corrupt and dangerous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came the African slave trade of the 16th century. In earlier times, slaves often came from Eastern Europe. (The word \u201cslave\u201d is related to \u201cSlav.\u201d) But with the discovery of the Americas and the surge in demand for labor, slavers set their sights on sub-Saharan Africa. They justified this plundering of humanity with arguments about the supposed inferiority and bestiality of Africans. In the United States, these ideas would evolve into a sadistic paternalism \u2014 that slavery was actually good for Africans because they were incapable of self-governance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These ideas \u2014 and probably all racist ideas \u2014 served a clear purpose: to buttress an economic system that depended on free labor. As Ibram X. Kendi pointed out in his book \u201cStamped From the Beginning,\u201d hate does not necessarily precede racism. Instead, societies often spin racist ideas out of self-interest \u2014 to further political or economic goals \u2014 and these ideas then lead to hate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even with the major effort that went into promoting the racial hierarchy, in the early Colonial period, poor whites frequently mingled and found common cause with African-Americans. Late-17th-century Colonial Virginia had a thriving multiracial population. Long before Karl Marx\u2019s class-based critique of capitalism, poor whites and blacks joined forces in several rebellions. The most famous was Bacon\u2019s Rebellion in 1676, in which indentured white servants and free and enslaved blacks took up arms against Virginia\u2019s governor but were crushed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This revolt shook the elites, who worked even harder to enforce the color lines. A series of laws meant to prevent interracial mingling (and to clearly define blacks as property, not citizens) went into effect. A white person in Virginia could be banished from the colony for having a child with a black or biracial person. White men might be whipped.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason given for these laws was some version of wanting to prevent the \u201cabominable mixture\u201d of the races. But the true purpose was to keep the structures of race intact in the American mind so that the economy, which depended on stolen labor, could continue whirring along.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which brings us back to Hawaii. Dr. Pauker runs the Intergroup Social Perception Lab at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Maybe her most intriguing finding is that Hawaii can rub off on visitors, changing how they think about race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some years ago, she began following 143 white college students from the mainland who\u2019d come to Hawaii to study. Over time, she discovered, many of them lost the essentialist ideas that characterized their thinking about race when they\u2019d just arrived. Dr. Pauker gauged this shift with a widely used questionnaire called the \u201cRace Conception Scale.\u201d It asks subjects to assess, on a seven-point scale, statements like \u201cracial groups are primarily determined by biology\u201d and \u201ca person\u2019s race is fixed at birth.\u201d The mainland students began to think about race more like students in Hawaii did \u2014 as a fluid concept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are many reasons for this transformation, she thinks. White mainland students often find themselves in the minority for the first time in their lives. And it\u2019s not always easy. Just as students of color often drop out at a higher rate than whites from universities on the mainland, at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, it\u2019s white students who drop out at higher rates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The statistic hints at what the white mainland students are going through. They are escaping, probably for the first time, what sociologists call \u201cwhite transparency.\u201d Whiteness stops being invisible to them; they suddenly perceive themselves as having a color \u2014 a race. And if they\u2019re going to have friends, they\u2019re forced to socialize with nonwhites, which means pushing past their preconceptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this is likely humbling and occasionally painful. But pain can mean growth. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like when you go and exercise,\u201d Dr. Pauker told me. \u201cUnless you tire your muscles out and experience some pain and discomfort, you\u2019re not going to get any benefit.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most remarkably, as these students\u2019 ideas about race relax, Dr. Pauker finds that they score higher on other tests of cognitive flexibility. They become more creative problem-solvers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Dr. Pauker and I discussed this over a poke bowl \u2014 a Hawaiian dish with East Asian influences that has become popular on the mainland, too \u2014 it brought to mind something James Baldwin said decades ago: Racism exacts a toll on those who are racist, distorting their humanity and hindering their ability to be fully self-reflective beings. That\u2019s surely no consolation to the victims of racism, but Dr. Pauker\u2019s findings seem to confirm Baldwin\u2019s thesis. The mental rigidity required to harbor racist ideas ends up bleeding over into other cognitive domains.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIn lots of circumstances, rigidity is helpful,\u201d Dr. Pauker told me, because it conserves mental energy. In theory, racial categorizing is supposed to work like a shorthand, helping us determine how to interact with people while expending minimal energy figuring out who they actually are. The problem, though, is that our perception of race and what it means is based on a model of the world that\u2019s almost always incorrect, and often entirely fabricated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker\u2019s studies have important caveats. White students who have come here from the mainland are, almost by definition, already an open-minded, adventurous bunch. Maybe it\u2019s not so surprising that for them, spending time in a nonmajority-white place would change how they think about race. The real trick would be to get a white supremacist to enroll here and see if there was the same transformation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Hawaii the harmonious melting pot is also a clich\u00e9 in its own right. Even in the early 20th century, mainland sociologists observing Hawaii marveled at how its different groups seemed to get along so well. They pointed to the archipelago, then a United States territory, as a vision of the future of civilization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe seem to be brought, so to speak, into the very presence of the historical process, where we may observe civilization as it evolves under something like laboratory conditions,\u201d wrote the University of Chicago sociologist Robert Park in 1937 about Hawaii. In 1925, the sociologist Romanzo Adams put it this way: \u201cThere is abundant evidence that the peoples of Hawaii are in process of becoming one people.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The interracial harmony that supposedly reigned was cited by other mainlanders to make more self-serving arguments. During World War II, the fact that people of Japanese descent, then the largest ethnic group on the islands, were loyal Americans was held up as evidence that the United States was not, as Japanese propaganda claimed, engaged in a racial war with Japan. During the Cold War, as communism spread in Asia, Americans pointed to Hawaii as evidence that Asians and other nonwhites could be well integrated into American society. And during the civil rights era, Hawaii was held up as a place where nonwhite people were happy with their lot. Why couldn\u2019t African-Americans be more like them? (In fact, partly inspired by the civil rights movement of the mainland, Native Hawaiians led a Hawaiian Renaissance in the 1970s.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Hawaiian academics are understandably sick of their state being seen by outsiders as a model of racial harmony. They view it as a fantasy that papers over very real inequities. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t glorify ourselves,\u201d Jonathan Y. Okamura, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, told me. \u201cWe need to work on the ways in which we continue to foster unequal opportunities for groups here.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prejudice against Micronesians, a recent immigrant group, is openly expressed, for example. People say things about them \u2014 calling them cockroaches and pushing for their genocide \u2014 \u201cthat would not fly anywhere else in this day and age,\u201d Sha Merirei Ongelungel, an artist and activist of Palauan descent, told me. Disgusted by this behavior, she created the Twitter hashtag #BeingMicronesian for people to share their experiences of prejudice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Being African-American isn\u2019t easy in Hawaii, either, said Akiemi Glenn, executive director of the Popolo Project in Honolulu. Stereotypes about African-Americans abound, she told me, in part because so few black people live on the islands to push back against them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, Ms. Glenn, whose family is from North Carolina, said that there is a complexity here that\u2019s lacking on the mainland. Ms. Glenn has Chinese, Native American, African and European ancestors. Back in North Carolina, she\u2019s just black. There\u2019s no room to claim her Chinese ancestry. But in Hawaii it often becomes a way to find common ground with others. \u201cThere are spaces for people to acknowledge their diverse genealogy,\u201d Ms. Glenn told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How did this space open up in Hawaii? Historians I asked pointed with reverence to one thing: the union organizing that occurred here in the postwar period.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the late 19th century, Hawaii was a constitutional monarchy, ruled by a  Hawaiian monarch. That ended in 1893 when a group of mostly white plantation owners, descended from an earlier wave of missionaries, overthrew the Hawaiian queen and declared, perversely, a republic. Their goal was annexation by the United States, which occurred in 1898, and access to its markets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, plantation owners imported workers from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and as far away as Portugal. They believed that, divided by different languages and cultures, the workers would be less likely to conspire together and cause trouble. Ethnic and racial stereotyping was widespread. The Chinese \u201ccoolies\u201d were cast as depraved gamblers; the Filipinos as prone to violence; the Japanese as cliquish and loyal only to the ascendant Japanese empire. The Portuguese, who tended to have higher-ranking jobs than everyone else, were a lesser form of white \u2014 better than the \u201cAsiatics\u201d they managed, but not quite good enough to join the Anglo-Saxon elite. Native Hawaiians, meanwhile, were seen as good-natured but lazy, and in need of white paternalism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But after World War II, in the space of a few years, this social order rapidly changed. The San Francisco-based International Longshore and Warehouse Union began organizing plantation, dock and other workers in Hawaii, who often labored in wretched conditions. Success would require interracial unity, union organizers quickly realized. The workers needed to overcome the ethnic divisions of plantation society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, sociologist Moon-Kie Jung describes what followed as \u201cproto <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.\u201d To build a union everyone would buy into, all ethnic groups had to be equally represented. And so union leadership positions were deliberately parceled out among ethnic groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not everyone in Hawaii was a longshoreman or plantation worker, of course. Yet that epoch of deliberate restructuring of the working class, Professor Okamura and others say, had a long-lasting effect on Hawaiian society. The effort succeeded in getting better working conditions from the \u201cbig five\u201d sugar and fruit companies that ruled the economy. Organized labor became a political force, helping to usher the Democratic Party into power in 1954. The party, which has largely dominated the state ever since, passed a series of progressive laws leading to investment in public education and a higher minimum wage, and the state in 1974 became the first to mandate employer-provided health insurance. (The progressive tradition continues today: An early challenge to President Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban came from Hawaii.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We might call this the Marxist reading on what went right in Hawaii. Working-class Hawaiians realized that race was being used to divide them \u2014 keeping them from improving their lot. Dr. Brewer, the social psychologist, described this transformation as labor successfully creating a new \u201csuper ordinate\u201d identity that cut across racial lines. That new identity did not totally erase old divisions, but it superseded them, at least for a while. (It probably also helped that Hawaii never had any laws against miscegenation.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent decades, the legacy of labor organizing has begun to fray, says Professor Okamura. Hawaii now has a high proportion of students in private school. Its public schools have become more racially and ethnically segregated, preventing the intergroup relationships that he thinks were so important in the past. But he says the history of organized labor in Hawaii suggests that you can, by deliberately dismantling racial barriers and fostering opportunity for everyone, change race relations in society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One other holdover from Hawaii\u2019s plantation past, when laborers of different backgrounds worked closely together, is a tradition of ethnic joke-telling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hawaii is not a politically correct society where everyone is \u201cwoke.\u201d On the contrary, ethnic jokes are so common it can be jarring for people who aren\u2019t from Hawaii. (Here\u2019s one from the well-known Hawaiian-born comedian Frank De Lima, who himself has Portuguese ancestry: \u201cWhy did the Portagee water half of his lawn? He heard there was a 50 percent chance of rain.\u201d)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker\u2019s lab hasn\u2019t formally studied this \u2014 and there is academic debate about how benign these ethnic jokes really are \u2014 but she thinks that the tradition may do some good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberal parents often claim they\u2019re blind to race, that they don\u2019t see it. But Dr. Pauker has found that, on the mainland, this may paradoxically allow stereotypes to creep into children\u2019s understanding of race. If you don\u2019t actively shape how children think about race, they may be more likely to absorb hurtful and damaging clich\u00e9s from the social ether.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Partly because of racial joking, race is always on the mind here. When people think about race consciously, she posits, it helps prevent essentialist thinking from taking root unconsciously. Joking about ethnic stereotypes, especially about one\u2019s own group, at least keeps conversations about race in Hawaii on the surface, rather than pushing them underground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>People are frank about other aspects of race as well in Hawaii. When she grew up, she recalls, people often referred to her as \u201cthat hapa girl\u201d (\u2018hapa\u201d means \u201chalf\u201d in Hawaiian pidgin), and she didn\u2019t think twice about it. Maybe that\u2019s because so many others were also hapa. Or perhaps that nonchalance is because this racial ribbing didn\u2019t occur against a background of any clear majority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An intriguing finding from Dr. Pauker\u2019s lab is that kids in Hawaii are terrible at defining other people\u2019s race compared with kids on the mainland. That\u2019s not because they don\u2019t see the features usually associated with race. It\u2019s because, when shown photos, they complicate their answers. Whereas a kid on the mainland might simply say \u201cAsian,\u201d in Hawaii, kids tend to say something like, \u201cJapanese, Chinese, Filipino and Norwegian.\u201d Instead of labeling a face \u201cwhite\u201d and leaving it at that, they might offer \u201cScottish, Irish, German and Italian.\u201d They are like fine wine connoisseurs while everyone else drinks cheap beer. From an early age, they see race as something complex and full of nuance, not something simple or black and white.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if Dr. Pauker and her colleagues are right that increased diversity and mixing help quash racism, why is the mainland now experiencing what feels like a resurgence of tribalism?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker\u2019s answer is that while, yes, the United States has become more diverse, Americans have also become more ideologically segregated from one another, making the kinds of meaningful interactions that erode racial thinking less likely. Part of that segregation comes from the news we watch, which has become more Balkanized. Part of it is the echo chamber of social media, which reflects back our own views. But another big reason may be the apparent absence of a larger umbrella identity \u2014 an American identity \u2014 that can supersede and contain tribal identities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it happens, Hawaii has that, too \u2014 an identity that, despite the efforts to prevent its emergence, coalesced among plantation workers. It\u2019s exemplified in the \u201caloha spirit,\u201d a concept roughly defined as an emphasis on mutual respect, getting along and taking care of one another, and in Hawaiian pidgin, the language people from many different backgrounds working on the plantation created to communicate. This identity is simply called \u201clocal.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But are any of these lessons really applicable on the mainland, or anywhere else?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hawaii is unique historically, demographically and perhaps most crucially, geographically. Justin Gest, a political scientist at George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government who studies the evolution of island societies, told me that islands, separated as they are from currents on the mainland, are often unique laboratories of human culture, caldrons where ingredients from different cultures recombine into something new. Living on a small, circumscribed piece of land marooned in the sea, Dr. Pauker points out, forces you to interact with your neighbors in ways that may not occur on continents. And when destructive forces threaten to tear society apart, those relationships matter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider what happened with the detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Worried about espionage and worse, the government rounded up and interned about 120,000 Japanese-Americans on the mainland. Hawaii arrested far fewer, about 1,800 \u2014 and that was despite the fact that some 150,000 people of Japanese ancestry then lived on the islands, and that Japanese planes had just bombed Pearl Harbor. What was different?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The officials in charge in Hawaii had deep connections with the local Japanese community. Robert Shivers, who headed Honolulu\u2019s F.B.I. office, and who had been dispatched from the mainland precisely to surveil the Japanese in the lead-up to World War II, had a young Japanese student living in his house, whom he would refer to as his adopted daughter. John Burns, the head of the Honolulu Police Department\u2019s Espionage Bureau, who grew up in Hawaii and would become the state\u2019s second governor, also had deep ties in the Japanese community. Both resisted calls from Washington to intern the Japanese, a story told by the journalist Tom Coffman in his book \u201cThe Island Edge of America.\u201d They also belonged to a multiethnic group called the Council for Interracial Unity, which had convened precisely to prevent the implosion of Hawaiian society in the event of war with Japan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This brings me back to the \u201caloha spirit,\u201d which may hold a deeper lesson for all of us. This tradition, several people told me, came from Native Hawaiian culture. Professor Okamura, who otherwise pooh-poohed the idea of Hawaiian racial harmony, related how Native Hawaiians offered his great-grandmother food when she first arrived from Japan. Mr. Burns, who was governor from 1962 to 1974, recalled Hawaiians inviting him to eat as he wandered the beach as a boy. The mother of Daniel Inouye, the senator from Hawaii, was adopted and raised by a Native Hawaiian family \u2014 something she often reminded him of.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Separately, these are all just heartwarming anecdotes. But together they suggest that even as Hawaii was subject to the divisive forces roiling the world, a different set of local customs coursing beneath the surface served as a type of counterbalance. Where did they come from?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Capt. James Cook first arrived in Hawaii in 1778, between 200,000 and 800,000 people lived in the archipelago. (Huge swaths of the population later succumbed to diseases the Westerners brought with them.) Polynesians may have first come to the islands as early as 1,700 years ago. Over the centuries, they developed elaborate methods of agricultural and resource management. They irrigated fields of taro, sugar cane, sweet potato and coconut trees with intricate ditches. Along the shore, they built fish ponds. They prohibited fishing in the ocean during certain seasons, an ancient form of sustainable fishery management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, crucially, the Hawaiians traded and shared among themselves \u2014 because to survive, they had to. People from the uplands exchanged sweet potato for fish with people from the coasts. A cultural norm of hospitality emerged. The islands weren\u2019t a utopia, of course. They experienced wars and occasional famines, and even had a kind of untouchable caste. But a premium was placed on getting along \u2014 the \u201caloha spirit.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a tourist commercial,\u201d Davianna Pomaikai McGregor, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said as she explained this to me. \u201cBut I think the Native Hawaiian people and the practice of aloha set the framework\u201d for race relations on the islands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason it sounds like a TV jingle is that it has become one: \u201cAloha\u201d is a marketing gimmick for the state\u2019s primary industry, tourism. A cartoonish version blares at visitors the moment they get off the plane, often in the form of dancers in grass skirts. Everyone I spoke to with Native ancestry found this irritating and sometimes insulting. One, a university student, told me that she felt like \u201caloha\u201d was used to make Native Hawaiians invisible in their own land. So it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s missing from the tourist version. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to give back, not just take take take,\u201d Mahesh Cleveland, a Hawaiian-born lawyer with Native ancestry, told me. \u201cThere is an expectation of reciprocity.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As an explanation about why race relations are different in Hawaii, the \u201caloha spirit\u201d is actually quite profound. It suggests that attitudes about other people stem, in part, from our understanding of the ecological limits of the world we inhabit. If you think that the resources of the world are limitless and that you don\u2019t really need other people to survive \u2014 that they\u2019re disposable because the bounty is endless \u2014 you may be inclined to treat people as things. But if you\u2019re aware of how much you depend on others and how small and fragile the world is, you\u2019re likely to have a very different approach to human relationships.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Traditions of hospitality toward the stranger exist in many cultures. They\u2019re central to Christianity, for instance. But for the past 500 years of European and then American expansion, during which the modern race idea was forged, the idea that the world\u2019s bounty was limitless, and that there was little downside to its relentless exploitation, has dominated. That attitude is now getting us into trouble as we change the climate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If we could begin to grasp the limits of the planet we live on, if we could understand that the earth itself is an island and that we are all dependent on one another for survival, perhaps we would see each other differently, too \u2014 and have less use for the very idea of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

But then everything went to heck on the PR front, and evidently now you can say anything you want about the company, since any attempt to correct the record on its behalf is no longer \"credible.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By some transitive property that we don't fully understand, this even stripped the company of the presumption of innocence in legal matters. Journalists, no longer fearing Coke's efforts to hold them to the truth, no longer seem to hew to the cautious path they did a year ago. Thus Business Week's Dean Foust feels free to offer a lecture on what \"racist\" Coke must do to redeem itself because \"its Southern bottlers taunted and terrorized Coke's first black salesmen\" and \"legendary Chief Executive Robert S. Woodruff questioned civil rights legislation in the 1960s.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hmm, such throwaway journalism is hard to reconcile with a mountain of historical documentation. Mr. Woodruff is known to have urged Atlanta politicians to testify on behalf of the 1964 civil rights act. He used his clout to push a reluctant business community to embrace Martin Luther King Jr. And he was famous for railing against Jim Crow at every opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it seems peculiarly cavalier to blame Coke, when it was trying to integrate its sales force, for the racist behavior of Southern bottlers who were, after all, independent businessmen. He might as well dub Branch Rickey racist for sending Jackie Robinson out to suffer abuse at the hands of racist Dodger fans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an earlier article, the magazine celebrated Cyrus Mehri, the lawyer in the Coke case, because he \"unearthed tapes of Texaco managers making racist comments in meetings and leaked them to the New York Times.\" But what Mr. Mehri really leaked was a transcript that falsely accused a Texaco executive of uttering the word \"nigger.\" The word on the tape turned out to be \"Nicholas.\" Texaco, all the while pleading it had done nothing wrong, nevertheless paid $176 million to make the headlines go away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wall Street doesn't care about rights and wrongs, though, and the demand for Coke to settle the current lawsuit has become intense too. We'll probably never know how the allegations of present-day discrimination would have stood up in court. All the more reason, then, for journalists to evince some skepticism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Mehri's latest smoking gun is Coke's own effort to assess and address the frustrations of black employees, initiated by then-president Doug Ivester. Mr. Mehri seems to believe all big corporations are intrinsically racist, so any evidence of them attending to racial matters is ipso facto evidence of racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, we've learned a few things after 30 years of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lawsuit, echoing Coke's internal review, complains that blacks are concentrated in human resources and public affairs rather than \"revenue generating areas.\" History obviously plays a role here. A lot of companies put blacks where they would be visible to fellow employees and the outside world. But the subsequent \"clustering\" phenomenon has become a subject of thoughtful academic investigation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Harvard's Rosabeth Kanter pointed out long ago in a pioneering study of corporate women, when you arrive as a new recruit and look around and see nobody who looks like you, it's not a happy moment for most people. Those who follow in the same department are spared the trials of tokenism. Relax, experiment, work in spurts -- they are freer to do all the things that effective people do, rather than trying to seem perpetually busy, as people do who are under a microscope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more, workers tend to recruit others like themselves through personal connections, exactly what students of diversity say is a good way to set the ball rolling toward organizational change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At Coke, critics also fasten on the fact that, as noted by Coke's own internal review, scattered blacks felt the need to create informal networks for \"sanity checks.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet such groups are precisely what diversity experts recommend. Indeed, Coke may have gone too far recently in trying to officially sponsor such groups. One thing we've learned is the importance of informal networks to share information on how to get along and succeed. Everything isn't in the employee handbook.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Guess what? Hiring people isn't the same as truly integrating them. Outsiders like to imagine corporations as all-powerful authoritarian institutions that can decree changes in social reality. In fact companies can't do for employees what they must do for themselves. Sociologists have even coined the term \"social trap\" for the problems of tokenism and stigmatization that arise from clumsy corporate attempts at <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at least companies have shown a propensity to learn. Diversity is fact of life, like the weather and fluctuating government policy, which must be managed. Hence the new popularity of \"diversity management\" or the fine science of bending over backward to be fair to minorities without being unfair to others.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Had the Texaco tapes fallen into competent journalistic hands, they would have told a story of a company in the throes of downsizing (the subject of most of the conversations on the tapes) but still wrestling with the need to recruit and promote minorities and women.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coke's huge financial success over the last decade was due to the consolidation of its bottlers, but this also spawned an army of redundant staffers at headquarters to serve a dwindling bottler retinue. As the Atlanta Constitution reported, the joke around Coke's campus was that you would only have to work three months a year if you could just locate the other three people who are already doing your job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such companies, by definition, clog the pathways of upward advancement -- lo and behold, a key complaint in the bias lawsuit. This is another reason the case has become a media feast. In keeping with eternal corporate dynamic, Coke recently tried to undo a decade's worth of bloat by laying off 40% of its headquarters staff. Overnight, hundreds of employees discovered they had a grievance just as Mr. Mehri was fishing for class-action status.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But don't expect journalists to set black frustration at Coke into a larger context of employee frustration. When it comes to racial matters, their greatest fear is that somebody might catch them writing a complicated truth and interpret it as \"racist.\"</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 19s "}}

ROBINSON; Eight-Hour Bill Shows Davis' True Colors; Forget what he says about charting a centrist course. Look at the actions he's taken since he was elected last fall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sooner or later it had to happen. After carefully cultivating the image that he is making good on his campaign pledge to lead California from the center, Gov. Gray Davis has taken a sharp turn leftward by signing legislation making California the only state except Alaska to require overtime pay after an eight-hour day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The decision unmasks a reality that state Republicans--still shell-shocked after last November's drubbing at the polls--have yet to effectively challenge Davis on, which is that the new governor's course is not nearly as centrist as he would like us to believe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Flanked on the left by an unarguably liberal California Legislature and the labor, environmental and trial lawyer interest groups that backed his candidacy, Davis barely needs to break a sweat to look moderate by comparison. But he can't leave those constituencies completely empty-handed--and he certainly hasn't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State labor laws across the nation generally require overtime pay after a 40-hour week. Employers are comfortable with that rule and report that most employees governed by it seem to enjoy the flexibility of working fewer hours some days and making up the time on other days. The bill that Davis signed on Tuesday was one of organized labor's top legislative priorities for the year. It reverses a decision by the Industrial Welfare Commission two years ago to scrap overtime pay after an eight-hour day in favor of the 40-hour rule.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Jan. 1, 2000, California will thus become one of two states to require overtime pay after eight hours, which in this state affects some 8 million employees and tens of thousands of businesses. California workers and companies alike will lose flexibility. Employees now working more than eight hours a day but less than 40 hours a week will likely lose pay. And California's business climate can now be justifiably indicted by other states competing for investment and jobs as having the country's singularly most rigid regulatory regime governing workplaces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While unions celebrated, Davis and his aides struggled to claim that, at the governor's insistence, employers' concerns were accommodated in the legislation with provisions allowing various exemptions. But those provisions offer nothing more than a fig leaf of flexibility, and neither Republican legislators nor the state's major business organizations bought it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conventional wisdom among Capitol-watchers has held that Davis alternates between tacking a little bit to the left, then a little bit to the right, keeping allies generally mollified, critics off-balance and his centrist image intact. Exhibiting the same message discipline they demonstrated throughout the campaign, Davis and his spinmeisters chant the \"I am governing from the center\" mantra virtually every day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But does the message match the record? Forcing state businesses to don a new regulatory straitjacket prescribed in the eight-hour legislation is not the first time in his young administration that Davis has veered off center. Union, environmental and trial lawyer activists have been rewarded with top appointments drawn from their ranks. Davis has orchestrated the reinstitution of a form of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> at the University of California. Despite promising a new relationship with Mexico, he is still on record opposing NAFTA and shows no sign of challenging his union supporters by backing other free-trade measures that can help California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tougher challenges to Davis' moderate image lie ahead. Will he approve legislation piling new mandates on health care plans and allowing patients to sue HMOs? How far will he go on gun control, labor and the environment? As reported by The Times' George Skelton, the governor and his aides are alarmed that an avalanche of bills landing on his desk on these subjects could, with increasing frequency, force Davis to choose between his natural political allies and his pledge to govern from the middle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis is no flaming liberal. He seems to genuinely understand the limits of government power and especially the limits to the voters' patience for a return to the halcyon days of big government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Sacramento is made up of more than just a governor, and a vast state administration is made up of more than one man. Union leaders, trial lawyers, environmentalists and activists who believe in regulatory expansion are in charge again. Every so often Davis tells them to slow down. But he doesn't tell them to stop.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James W. Robinson is advisor to the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

University of Texas, a case involving racial preferences in college admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Abigail Fisher, a white woman, claims that she was denied admission to the university on account of her race. The school says that it's allowed to take race into account to achieve a diverse student body.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts was among the more aggressive questioners during oral arguments Wednesday, asking a lawyer for the school what constituted an acceptable \"critical mass\" of black and Hispanic students on campus and whether someone who was one-quarter or one-eighth Hispanic could claim that ethnicity on an application. He also suggested that the university is essentially setting percentage goals for minority students without acknowledging the practice. If Chief Justice Roberts is going to start voting with the court's liberals, he has an odd of showing it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Of course, the term ahead will provide many more opportunities for the chief justice to signal his sympathies,\" wrote Tejinder Singh of SCOTUSblog on Thursday. \"But yesterday's argument undermines the theory that Chief Justice Roberts switched teams for good. In all likelihood, he is a safe vote for Ms. Fisher.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Todd Gaziano, a member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, agreed. \"The ObamaCare decision disappointed me and a lot of other people,\" he told me in an interview Thursday, but Chief Justice Roberts is already on record as a \"pretty strong proponent of true equality and ending discrimination.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gaziano, who co-authored an amicus brief in the Fisher case, noted that the chief justice took conservative positions in previous rulings involving redistricting in Texas and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in a Seattle school district. \"It's not just his questions yesterday that give me encouragement.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Jason L.

Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, \"America in Black and White,\" Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat Against ": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 45s "}}

He was still steamed about what an unforgivably lousy negotiator his president had been on the debt ceiling agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One particular Obama move he found appalling above all the rest. \u201cThere is a provision in our Constitution that speaks to making sure that the United States meets its obligations,\u201d the president had said, referring to Section 4 of the 14th Amendment, \u201cand there have been some suggestions\u201d \u2014 by Bill Clinton and various legal scholars \u2014 \u201cthat a president could use that language to basically ignore that debt ceiling rule.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my Hollywood supernegotiator friend, Obama should\u2019ve stopped right there \u2014 or, even better, followed up with that standard ambiguous saber-rattling line: \u201cNo option is off the table.\u201d Raising the possibility of unilateral executive action would\u2019ve strengthened his hand against the Republicans. Instead, Mr. Transparent and Reasonable instantly ruled it out in the weakest way possible: \u201cI have talked to my lawyers. They are not persuaded that that is a winning argument.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My friend recited the president\u2019s surrender sentence incredulously, slipping an obscene seven-letter gerund in front of lawyers. Since the Republicans were threatening to go nuclear in unprecedented fashion, why didn\u2019t the president at least threaten to use his unprecedented nuclear option to stop them?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, it\u2019s a pity Barack Obama isn\u2019t more like Richard Nixon. I think of Nixon every year around now, as another anniversary of his resignation (Tuesday the 9th) rolls around. President Nixon famously tried convincing the Communists that he might literally go nuclear if they didn\u2019t behave. \u201cI call it the Madman Theory,\u201d he explained to his chief of staff. \u201cI want the North Vietnamese to believe that I\u2019ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, a lot of us swooned over Obama partly because he seemed so prudent, straightforward and even-keeled. But now, with Republicans spectacularly applying the Madman Theory for the first time in domestic politics, Obama\u2019s nonconfrontational reasonableness isn\u2019t looking like such a virtue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s frustrating. We\u2019ve had presidents who were intelligent and progressive but also cynical and ruthless when necessary. Effective, tough-minded, visionary liberals such as F.D.R., Clinton ... and Nixon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In popular imagination, Nixon remains nothing but a great goblin \u2014 scowling bomber of Southeast Asia, panderer to fear and racism, paranoid anti-Semite, dispatcher of burglars \u2014 but the truth is, he governed further to the left than any president who followed him. The overreaching Euro-socialist nanny state that today\u2019s Republicans despise? That blossomed in the Nixon administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Spending on social services doubled, and military budgets actually decreased. He oversaw the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. His administration was the first to encourage and enable American Indian tribal autonomy. He quadrupled the staff of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, almost tripled federal outlays for civil rights and began <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in federal hiring. He supported the Equal Rights Amendment and signed Title IX, the law granting equality to female student athletes. One of his Supreme Court appointees wrote the Roe v. Wade decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nixon made Social Security cost-of-living increases automatic, expanded food stamps and started Supplemental Security Income for the disabled and elderly poor. It helped, of course, that Democrats controlled the House and Senate. But it was the president, not Congress, who proposed a universal health insurance plan and a transformation of welfare that would have set a guaranteed minimum income and allowed men to remain with their welfare-recipient families. It was Nixon who radically intervened in the free market by imposing wage and price controls, launched d\u00e9tente with the Soviets, normalized relations with Mao\u2019s China and let the Communists win in Vietnam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, for good measure,\u00a0the\u00a0budget for the National Endowment for the Arts grew sixfold, by far the biggest increase by any president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea of Nixon \u2014 Nixon?  \u2014 as a de facto liberal provokes cognitive dissonance, especially among people over 50. Facts notwithstanding, they refuse to buy it, as if they\u2019ve been fooled by a parlor trick. But the only trick involved is judging Nixon circa 1970 by the ideological standards of 2011.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My late mother, who voted for every Republican presidential candidate from Wendell Willkie through George H.W. Bush, became a Democrat in her 70s. \u201cThese black hats,\u201d she said of the G.O.P. right, \u201chave gotten as nutty as fruitcakes. Nothing they say shocks me anymore.\u201d She voted five times for Nixon, whose Madman Theory was a tactical posturing to make the Communists think he was an unhinged, reckless fanatic itching to wreak havoc.

In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back.
