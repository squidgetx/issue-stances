You wanted guys not with the biggest muscles, but the most heart. Not the mopers who would walk off the field when they felt the first raindrops or got bumped in the nose.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You looked for the kids who really wanted to play--and to win.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so it is as well in the bruising contact sport of politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You want candidates with fire in the belly, defined by William Safire in his \"New Political Dictionary\" as \"an unquenchable thirst for power or glory; the burning drive to win a race or achieve a goal.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They make the best candidates because they run with enthusiasm. And if elected, they're less likely to goof off or to whine, like so many politicians and athletes, about adversity and their sacrifice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I thought about this last week when the entry deadline for the gubernatorial race passed and three potential candidates--two stars and a prospect--remained on the sidelines. They didn't have the fire in the belly to compete. And that caused a lot of bellyaching within the political establishment--mostly among Democrats--about being stuck with the reserves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We deserve better. What a choice!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, time out. Quit the moaning. Like it or not, one of these four people will be California's next governor: Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, 51; or a Democrat--Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, 55; zillionaire airline exec Al Checchi, 49; or Rep. Jane Harman, 52, of Torrance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They've all got the fire--the energy and the courage--to fight for the most important elective office to be filled in America this year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And as Checchi campaign manager Darry Sragow points out: \"The absolute truth is the republic will survive with any of these four at the helm.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's play could've-should've for a moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 64, could have been a great governor. But she's very comfortable in her current job and dreaded getting roughed up in a gubernatorial race. She was flinching. So Feinstein is better off staying in the Senate, where she excels, and the state probably is better off too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leon Panetta, 59--former Monterey congressman and White House chief of staff--had promise. He could have been an excellent governor. But he wasted all last year deferring to fellow Democrat Feinstein. She didn't bow out until Jan. 20, too late for him to get organized. If Panetta actually had the fire, however, he would have spent last year traveling the state, showing concern for its problems, raising money and positioning himself to run.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, 67, teased the news media and basked in the begging before concluding that he was just too comfortable--to run or to serve. \"Be careful, you might get what you're going after,\" Riordan said he told himself. \"I love California, but Los Angeles is still my No. 1 love.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fine. Then he made the right decision to stay there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But please spare us the spin about how the mayor was a virtual cinch winner. First, he had to beat Lungren for the GOP nomination. Lungren is a good Republican; Riordan is a good Republican mostly in the eyes of Democrats. He endorsed Feinstein in 1994 and didn't support either the anti-illegal immigration or anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> initiatives. He was a fat target for Lungren. Plus, he's not very good on the stump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new open primary certainly would have helped. But we'll never know whether enough Democrats would have crossed over to nominate Riordan for the Republicans. That's awfully iffy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What we're left with is a wide-open race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polls show Davis leading in the Democratic contest. But Checchi--having already spent more than $4 million of his fortune on TV ads--is moving up fast. In mock general elections, both Davis and Checchi run about even with Lungren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harman is the only woman in the race and that's presumed to be a plus. But she's a late entry and unknown outside L.A. She urgently needs to develop a compelling message and to spend millions of her own dollars getting it out on TV.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a myth that Harman also is the only moderate running. Davis still gets tagged as a liberal because two decades ago he was Gov. Jerry Brown's top aide, but basically he's a moderate. And Checchi? He wants to execute serial rapists. That's hardly liberal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've got a race between three experienced pols and an outsider--Checchi--who frequently hasn't even voted. However, he did spend all last year stumping the state boning up on issues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe these aren't the best governors conceivable. But they're the most eager. They've got the fire and really want the job. The others refused to run.

{"id": "test_question_pro_testing_2", "displayed_text": "<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/408654746.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Mr. Lieberman's Debut</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JOSEPH LIEBERMAN introduced himself to the American people last night, and was introduced by his wife and others, as a classic American story--the first in his family to graduate from college, the son of a father who worked nights and a mother who valued family and education. Much has been made of his status as the first Jew nominated by a major party for president or vice president, but his message was the universality of the American dream and of the values that motivate him--faith, family, hard work, public service, equal opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was an affecting speech, well received in the convention hall. But the senator's challenge went beyond making a good first impression. Some of the very qualities that recommended him to Al Gore also represent sources of tension now that he is on the ticket. His reputation for integrity stems in part from his criticism of Clinton-Gore fundraising excesses and of President Clinton's ethical lapses. His reputation for innovative thinking and bipartisanship stems in part from questioning policies that remain sacrosanct in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Since his selection, the George Bush campaign has even portrayed Mr. Lieberman as closer to its views than to Mr. Gore's--somehow not a real Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So last night Mr. Lieberman portrayed himself as very much in the mainstream of Democratic thinking. He wrapped himself in the language of civil rights and a fair distribution of national prosperity. Whatever differences he might have with some Democrats, he seemed to say--or with Al Gore--pale next to differences between the parties. In so doing, he glossed over some of his past independent stands. There was no mention of President Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky scandal, which the senator bravely criticized in the past, nor of the fundraising coffees at the White House, which Mr. Gore attended. Likewise, he endorsed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which he has questioned, and was mute on tort reform or school vouchers, two policies that Mr. Lieberman has sympathized with. Tort reform is anathema to the trial bar, which donates lavishly to Democratic campaign coffers. School vouchers appall the teachers' unions; teachers account for some 12 percent of the delegates at the convention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Sen. Lieberman emphasized areas in which he and Mr. Gore agree, such as health care, the Democrats' favorite issue this year. He sought to draw a distinction between Democrats and Gov. George W. Bush on the environment. He warned that the Republicans' tax plans would benefit the wealthy, slighting Social Security and Medicare. And on the crusade against indecency in popular culture, not popular in Hollywood, he claimed kinship with Al and Tipper Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Lieberman in the past has been refreshingly willing to acknowledge the complexities of issues such as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and the failings of public schools. One question now is whether the Gore ticket can offer new ideas without venturing outside the confines imposed by the Democratic Party's core constituents. Education is a test case, even though the federal role in this area is limited. Mr. Lieberman avoided the radioactive subject of vouchers, but he did declare that \"schools need to be held to the highest standards of performance and accountability.\" That may prove more radical than it sounds, depending on how it translates into policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrats have held the White House for two terms in part by convincing Americans that they are the party that fights, as Mr. Lieberman said last night, to find \"room for everybody\" around the table of American prosperity. But they also have succeeded by separating themselves enough from their traditional positions to look fresh. They have become the party of fiscal responsibility and are willing to see that government programs must be enlivened with new management styles (hence Mr. Gore's talk of reinventing government) and with competition (hence the Democrats' support for charter schools). This openness needs to be preserved. \"We can change, we can challenge, we can agree to disagree,\" one speaker declared on Tuesday night. That speaker was Jesse Jackson, in some ways the champion of traditionalists.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 38s "}}

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject.

But recent survey findings may foster mutual understanding by debunking one of the most pernicious myths underlying racial division: that blacks and whites have fundamentally different views and aspirations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This myth has fueled demagogues on both sides of the racial divide, especially in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots. But poll results just released by the left-leaning Joint Center for Political Studies reveal that most blacks aspire like other Americans to safe streets, good schools and home ownership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of equal import, the survey demonstrates that mainstream black Americans are far more conservative than most of the politicians and organizations that purport to speak for them. This philosophical gulf perhaps was most pronounced near the end of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, when national groups like the NAACP stridently opposed the Supreme Court nominee while blacks in general approved by a three-to-one ratio (along with some local NAACP chapters).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Joint Center study found that more blacks label themselves conservative (33%) than either liberal (28%) or moderate (31%). Young blacks 18 to 34 years old are more conservative, with 38% describing themselves as such.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But conservative blacks have not yet found a hospitable political home. A minuscule 5% of those surveyed are Republicans. The GOP's failure to attract like-minded blacks offers vivid testimony to years of hostility or neglect by Republicans toward matters of concern to black Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Poll findings on specific issues highlight common ground between whites and blacks. Despite opposition by establishment civil rights groups to capital punishment as racially discriminatory, the survey found most blacks favor the death penalty. This finding reflects serious concern about crime. More than half the blacks surveyed live within a few blocks of places they're afraid to walk in at night, and nearly half live in neighborhoods where young men carry guns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Education is the number one election issue for black Americans, the survey found, and 75% support a \"back-to-basics\" direction. In sharp contrast to politicians and establishment civil rights leaders, an amazing 88% support a \"voucher\" system that would allow parents to choose the schools their children attend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like many other Americans, most blacks are skeptical about current welfare policies. Some 57% believe government should not increase aid when single mothers have more children, and 75% think such a policy change would encourage single women to have fewer children. The poll found 91% of blacks support opportunities for low-income people to become homeowners by buying their public housing, a centerpiece of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp's \"empowerment\" agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Joint Center poll echoes an earlier survey by Linda Lichter, which found a gulf over major issues between leaders of black organizations and randomly selected blacks. The survey found 77% of black leaders believed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should be the most important factor in hiring and education decisions; indeed, National Urban League President John Jacob called this \"the one constant that must be shared by anyone who presumes to hold a leadership position in the black community.\" But the survey found most blacks would flunk this ideological litmus test. Some 77% believe ability rather than race should be the determining factor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Likewise, the Lichter survey found 68% of black leaders favoring forced busing for integration, while 53% of mainstream blacks opposed busing. Two-thirds of black leaders opposed the death penalty for murder, compared with 55% of all blacks who favored it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These findings contain powerful messages for both sides of the policy debate. They explain why liberal groups like the NAACP have lost thousands of members in recent years, particularly among younger blacks. By focusing on social engineering schemes such as racial quotas and set-asides that have little relevance to the real problems facing many blacks, the civil rights leadership elite is growing increasingly out of touch with its constituency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this regard, the leadership elite's problems are twofold. Racial preferences don't much aid a black underclass beset with ravaging crime, economic stagnation and inadequate schools. Likewise, the growing number of blacks who have joined the economic mainstream may have more in common with other middle class Americans than with those whose agenda remains rooted in the battles of the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For conservatives, opportunities are apparent. But instead of partisan efforts, they should concentrate on specific issues in which common cause exists with mainstream blacks. Groups such as the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise and the Institute for Justice have built potent coalitions with low-income people on such empowerment issues as school choice, tenant management of public housing, and challenges to regulatory barriers to entry-level entrepreneurial opportunities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If only by default, Bill Clinton likely will win the majority of black votes this November, and he mouthed the rhetoric of empowerment at the Democratic National Convention. But to the extent he caves into special interest groups -- he promised teachers unions he'd oppose school choice that includes private schools -- it could create openings for George Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush has fumbled on the race issue, capitulating on a divisive civil rights bill that means little to most blacks while failing to forcefully articulate a positive alternative. Mr. Bush needs to take his case directly to black Americans, presenting a clear agenda to create tangible opportunities for upward mobility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus far he has not done so. Bush proposals on urban enterprise zones, tenant management, school choice and tax relief are pitched separately and dispassionately, rather than as a comprehensive package the Democrats can't match. The administration some time ago banished the \"E\" word -- empowerment -- from its official lexicon to keep Jack Kemp's star from shining too brightly. So long as it lacks a credible vision and messenger, the GOP richly deserves cynicism from blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regardless of its political or policy implications, the survey's most significant impact is to undermine the stereotype that all blacks think alike -- a stereotype perpetuated by establishment civil rights groups who punish those who dissent from establishment orthodoxy. Federal Appeals Court Judge Leon Higginbotham, for instance, recently scolded Justice Thomas in print for supposedly betraying his race by committing various perceived philosophical heresies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it was the Thomas nomination itself that disproved this patronizing stereotype once and for all. For Justice Thomas personifies the American Dream of achievement based on merit and hard work. His rise from poverty and segregation marked a vindication of the ideas of equality and opportunity -- ideals to which blacks and whites alike are committed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Martin Luther King Jr. was perhaps the last civil rights leader to understand that. Instead of emphasizing differences among people the way contemporary civil rights leaders often do, he drew constantly upon the principles and aspirations that unite us as Americans, black and white, rich and poor.

But then everything went to heck on the PR front, and evidently now you can say anything you want about the company, since any attempt to correct the record on its behalf is no longer \"credible.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By some transitive property that we don't fully understand, this even stripped the company of the presumption of innocence in legal matters. Journalists, no longer fearing Coke's efforts to hold them to the truth, no longer seem to hew to the cautious path they did a year ago. Thus Business Week's Dean Foust feels free to offer a lecture on what \"racist\" Coke must do to redeem itself because \"its Southern bottlers taunted and terrorized Coke's first black salesmen\" and \"legendary Chief Executive Robert S. Woodruff questioned civil rights legislation in the 1960s.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hmm, such throwaway journalism is hard to reconcile with a mountain of historical documentation. Mr. Woodruff is known to have urged Atlanta politicians to testify on behalf of the 1964 civil rights act. He used his clout to push a reluctant business community to embrace Martin Luther King Jr. And he was famous for railing against Jim Crow at every opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it seems peculiarly cavalier to blame Coke, when it was trying to integrate its sales force, for the racist behavior of Southern bottlers who were, after all, independent businessmen. He might as well dub Branch Rickey racist for sending Jackie Robinson out to suffer abuse at the hands of racist Dodger fans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an earlier article, the magazine celebrated Cyrus Mehri, the lawyer in the Coke case, because he \"unearthed tapes of Texaco managers making racist comments in meetings and leaked them to the New York Times.\" But what Mr. Mehri really leaked was a transcript that falsely accused a Texaco executive of uttering the word \"nigger.\" The word on the tape turned out to be \"Nicholas.\" Texaco, all the while pleading it had done nothing wrong, nevertheless paid $176 million to make the headlines go away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wall Street doesn't care about rights and wrongs, though, and the demand for Coke to settle the current lawsuit has become intense too. We'll probably never know how the allegations of present-day discrimination would have stood up in court. All the more reason, then, for journalists to evince some skepticism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Mehri's latest smoking gun is Coke's own effort to assess and address the frustrations of black employees, initiated by then-president Doug Ivester. Mr. Mehri seems to believe all big corporations are intrinsically racist, so any evidence of them attending to racial matters is ipso facto evidence of racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, we've learned a few things after 30 years of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lawsuit, echoing Coke's internal review, complains that blacks are concentrated in human resources and public affairs rather than \"revenue generating areas.\" History obviously plays a role here. A lot of companies put blacks where they would be visible to fellow employees and the outside world. But the subsequent \"clustering\" phenomenon has become a subject of thoughtful academic investigation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Harvard's Rosabeth Kanter pointed out long ago in a pioneering study of corporate women, when you arrive as a new recruit and look around and see nobody who looks like you, it's not a happy moment for most people. Those who follow in the same department are spared the trials of tokenism. Relax, experiment, work in spurts -- they are freer to do all the things that effective people do, rather than trying to seem perpetually busy, as people do who are under a microscope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more, workers tend to recruit others like themselves through personal connections, exactly what students of diversity say is a good way to set the ball rolling toward organizational change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At Coke, critics also fasten on the fact that, as noted by Coke's own internal review, scattered blacks felt the need to create informal networks for \"sanity checks.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet such groups are precisely what diversity experts recommend. Indeed, Coke may have gone too far recently in trying to officially sponsor such groups. One thing we've learned is the importance of informal networks to share information on how to get along and succeed. Everything isn't in the employee handbook.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Guess what? Hiring people isn't the same as truly integrating them. Outsiders like to imagine corporations as all-powerful authoritarian institutions that can decree changes in social reality. In fact companies can't do for employees what they must do for themselves. Sociologists have even coined the term \"social trap\" for the problems of tokenism and stigmatization that arise from clumsy corporate attempts at <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at least companies have shown a propensity to learn. Diversity is fact of life, like the weather and fluctuating government policy, which must be managed. Hence the new popularity of \"diversity management\" or the fine science of bending over backward to be fair to minorities without being unfair to others.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Had the Texaco tapes fallen into competent journalistic hands, they would have told a story of a company in the throes of downsizing (the subject of most of the conversations on the tapes) but still wrestling with the need to recruit and promote minorities and women.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coke's huge financial success over the last decade was due to the consolidation of its bottlers, but this also spawned an army of redundant staffers at headquarters to serve a dwindling bottler retinue. As the Atlanta Constitution reported, the joke around Coke's campus was that you would only have to work three months a year if you could just locate the other three people who are already doing your job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such companies, by definition, clog the pathways of upward advancement -- lo and behold, a key complaint in the bias lawsuit. This is another reason the case has become a media feast. In keeping with eternal corporate dynamic, Coke recently tried to undo a decade's worth of bloat by laying off 40% of its headquarters staff. Overnight, hundreds of employees discovered they had a grievance just as Mr. Mehri was fishing for class-action status.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But don't expect journalists to set black frustration at Coke into a larger context of employee frustration. When it comes to racial matters, their greatest fear is that somebody might catch them writing a complicated truth and interpret it as \"racist.\"</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 8s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398321574.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>On Brown v. Board of Education, Call Him Thurgood Thomas</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The NAACP board is scheduled to decide today whether to join the interest groups that oppose a black Supreme Court nominee. Benjamin Hooks has said his group would have preferred another Thurgood Marshall. The NAACP should know that when it comes to the Supreme Court's most important civil-rights case, Clarence Thomas is another Thurgood Marshall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With all the smoke cooked up by Judge Thomas's critics, no one seems to have noticed that he takes precisely the same broad view of the constitutional promise of equality that Mr. Marshall as the lawyer arguing Brown v. Board of Education tried -- unsuccessfully -- to persuade the Supreme Court to adopt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 1954 case was a great victory for the civil-rights movement and especially for the NAACP where Mr. Marshall worked. The justices finally declared that separate but equal facilities were unconstitutional. A filibuster in the Senate perpetuated Jim Crow segregation, so it was appropriate that the court struck down these racist laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that Brown is a classic example of a correct result reached by lousy reasoning. The opinion by Chief Justice Earl Warren was based almost entirely on dubious sociological data on how much better black students supposedly learn when they study in the same classrooms as whites. A famous footnote cites behavior studies in publications such as the International Journal of Opinion and Attitude Research. It's now clear that this case was the beginning of an era of judicial activism that substituted shadows, penumbras and judicial social engineering for adherence to constitutional text and original intent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are nearly identical arguments about what the Brown opinion should have said in Mr. Marshall's legal briefs in the case and Judge Thomas's recent speeches and law-review articles. They agreed that the court should have based its decision on legal and constitutional sources, not sociologists. They both referred to the Declaration of Independence's self-evident truth that \"all men are created equal,\" which finally applied to blacks after the Civil War through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Marshall's brief and Judge Thomas's writings both cited Justice Harlan's dissent from the 1896 case that established the doctrine of separate but equal, Plessy v. Ferguson. Justice Harlan would instead have given the Fourteenth Amendment its commonsense reading, which is that it was intended to replace slavery with equality by forbidding the government from treating people differently by race. The amendment promised blacks all the privileges and immunities of citizenship and equal protection of the laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Thomas wrote that if the opinion in Brown had adopted this broader view of the Fourteenth Amendment, separate but equal could have been invalidated without citing \"Kenneth Clark's controversial doll studies, which could just as easily have been used in support of segregation as against it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court missed the forest for the trees. \"The Brown focus on environment overlooks the real problem with segregation, its origin in slavery, which was at fundamental odds with the founding principles. Had Brown done so, it would have been forced to talk about slavery, which it never mentions,\" Judge Thomas wrote. He said that a better understanding of the \"first principles of equality and liberty\" would \"lead us above petty squabbling over `quotas,' `<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>' and race-conscious remedies of social ills.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once on the Supreme Court, Mr. Marshall supported quotas, but he made some of the same points about a colorblind Constitution in his brief in Brown. \"The roots of our American egalitarian ideal extend deep into the history of the Western world,\" the brief said. \"Philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced an intellectual climate in which the equality of man was a central concept. Their beliefs rested upon the basic proposition that all man are endowed with certain natural rights.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Marshall's reference to natural rights is important because Judge Thomas's critics accuse him of weirdness for using similar terms. For different reasons, it's important reassurance for both liberals and conservatives to understand why Judge Thomas wrote about natural rights. The reason was his search as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for a more enduring guarantee of equality than the fleeting legal standards in Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals should know that Judge Thomas is not on a goose chase for penumbras or emanations from the Constitution into which he can insert his conservative policy preferences-as Justice Marshall too often did to enact his liberal views. Conservatives should know that he invokes natural rights in the service of original-intent jurisprudence. His law review article, \"Toward a `Plain Reading' of the Constitution -- The Declaration of Independence in Constitutional Interpretation,\" stressed that terms must be read according to their original meaning. Individual liberty is constitutionally protected, but group rights are not; discrimination must be punished, but not by mandating quotas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The NAACP's Mr. Hooks recently noted this distinction. Judge Thomas is \"not without some good points,\" he said, adding that \"if a black or a woman has been individually discriminated against or mistreated he'll go to the ends of the earth to correct it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now it turns out there's not much difference between Justice Marshall and Judge Thomas on the broadest issues of civil rights. It will be fascinating to see if the NAACP has the courage to abandon its usual liberal allies who hope to do to Judge Thomas what they did to Robert Bork.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"N/A (not enough information)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 56s "}}

Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater's political skills abandoned him recently when he participated in a racial dialogue that pointedly excluded whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's town meeting in Akron last week was fumbling and lacking focus. Mr. Clinton was snappish with one of the few prominent dissident voices and overstated the case when he declared that Colin Powell got to his exalted rank in the Army because of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this still is a very worthwhile effort. America has fumbled, and worse, on race for 250 years. Thus it's hardly surprising that a reasonably ambitious effort for addressing this festering American malady would encounter early trouble.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, this is a departure for President Clinton, who too often has focused on the small-bore, politically easy agenda items that his former political strategist, the infamous Dick Morris, so cheaply champions. But race is not small bore or easy. There's not only a risk that this won't succeed, but given the history, the odds are that it won't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometimes it's easy to forget that a little over 30 years ago, there were precious few blacks in the executive suites, newsrooms or political corridors; it was commonplace for African-Americans to be excluded from public accommodations and even the vote, and that throughout much of the South, drinking fountains were marked \"colored\" or \"white.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet for all the extraordinary progress over these past three decades, race remains an excruciating American dilemma. That's why the multifaceted Clinton initiative is as commendable as it is complex.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael K. Frisby reported in this newspaper last week that the White House is bringing the advisory committee on race back firmly under its control. New proposals, with a focus on youth, are being hatched in time for the January State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And there is far more sensitivity to the rap that this has been a one-sided dialogue excluding many conservatives or critics of controversial ideas like <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Next Wednesday, the advisory committee will meet with prominent conservative Bill Bennett. Two days later, President Clinton will meet with Jack Kemp and, probably, Ward Connerly, who led California's successful anti<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> ballot initiative last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, the specter of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hangs over this discussion. Americans are sharply divided over granting selective preferences to minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is seen as quotas or rigid preferences, particularly in school admissions or hiring and promotion, Americans are overwhelmingly opposed. If it is seen as opening up, assuring and even fostering equal opportunities, the public is solidly for it. The problem is that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has been all of the above.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In two of the most publicized votes, Californians by 54% to 46% voted down <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> on the state level a year ago. By the same margin, voters in Houston last month voted to continue that city's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program. In both cases, the opposing side argued the decision was stacked or the wording of the referendum was flawed; in fact, both votes are very indicative of where America is.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This was evident in the highly publicized incident at the president's town meeting in Akron, Ohio, last week. He asked author and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> critic Abigail Thernstrom if she wanted to end the type of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs that promoted Colin Powell in the Army. This issue and exchange has been seized upon by both sides with considerably more heat than light.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, according to Clifford Alexander, who was Secretary of the Army when Gen. Powell became a general, the promotion board came back with a paucity of minority candidates. He simply sent them back to see if other candidates could be found; Colin Powell was in the next group. \"This was not an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program,\" Mr. Alexander says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's absurd to suggest that the army -- or almost any other institution that has successfully integrated in recent years -- has followed the laissez-faire approach that abandons all remnants of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which is now espoused by many conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One good example is the U.S. Military Academy. West Point now sets a \"class composition goal\" of 7% to 9% African-American cadets every year. The last two incoming classes have been about 7.5% black. These goals are achieved by sending promising young African-Americans to the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School for a year to get them up to West Point standards. Overall, 14% of West Point's cadets attended this military prep school, but 37% of its African-Americans did. That is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, recognizing that there isn't a level playing field.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill Republicans are pushing in Congress would outlaw nonbinding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> goals, which would do away with much of what the Army and West Point are now achieving. That's why even some conservative African-Americans, like Rep. J.C. Watts (R., Okla.), urge caution before dismantling existing programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one has navigated this tightrope better than Gen. Powell. In his autobiography, he wrote that \"preferential\" treatment \"demeans\" achievement, but where discrimination has existed \"it is only fair to provide temporary means\" to catch up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week in an interview, Mr. Powell says the issue has nothing do with him but rather with where we are as a society and what works. \"Some of my friends take only the first part of what I wrote and conclude, `see, he's against preferences.' But that was very difficult to write and I nuanced it very carefully. We had a preference system for over 200 years that did not include black people.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What is essential now, he says, \"is to get away from the inflammatory stuff that shuts down dialogue. Let's stop saying that everyone on one side is a racist. Let's stop saying that all preferences are bad when we live in a system of preferences. We go to court over preferences if someone is black but not if they get a preference because their parents went to that school.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If President Clinton's initiative can help tame such inflammatory rhetoric, that alone will be a useful exercise.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 8m 14s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/430810646.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Better Never Than Late</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not content to deliberate endlessly over how to stamp out the national epidemic of flag desecration, Congress has come up with another bright idea: a bill officially apologizing for slavery. Though opposition to this gesture has made strange bedfellows out of Jesse Jackson (who called it ''meaningless'') and Newt Gingrich (''a dead end''), Bill Clinton is already hedging about it, a few Congressmen are calling for reparations, and the debate could easily eat up the full year of the President's promised race initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why not just cut to the chase, and have Strom Thurmond deliver the apology right now?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bipartisan, all-white Congressmen sponsoring the apology mean well. But as Eric Foner, the Columbia University historian who wrote the definitive text on Reconstruction, says: ''At the end of the Civil War, the slaves didn't want an apology. They wanted substantive change in the way things were -- 'Give us some land, and you can keep the apology.' '' If Congress wants to apologize, it might start with its own transgressions, from Willie Horton-inspired campaign ads to its persistent inability to address the inner-city meltdown that is the most intractable legacy of slavery and its bastard offspring, segregation, today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this would require substance, not symbolism, and when it comes to substance about race and poverty, both parties would rather play to the gallery. The G.O.P. focus on ending <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is a hit in the polls, so never mind that the party with a Congressional majority has offered teachers-union bashing in lieu of action to deal with the root of all ills, failing schools in grades K-12. Nor have the Republicans found a plausible substitute for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> that might win over the only three major figures in the party with credibility on race -- Colin Powell, Jack Kemp and the lone black Congressman, J. C. Watts -- all of whom favor a just reform of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span>, not its abolition without a net for the poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, has taken hits for what cynics regard as a public-relations racial policy: a call for a national conversation, the appointment of yet another blue-ribbon commission and town meetings that may fade as quickly as the volunteerism summit in Philadelphia. In fairness, he should be given the year he's asked for, and the benefit of the doubt. But you don't have to be cynical to have lots of doubts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid conversation about race -- as opposed to the P.C. homilies of Mr. Clinton's San Diego speech -- is easier decreed than had in a country that has already repressed memory of the stark racial gap revealed by the polar black and white reactions to both O. J. verdicts. As for actions, Mr. Clinton took seven months to fill the top job for civil-rights enforcement in his own Justice Department. At the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, there is now a backlog of 75,000 discrimination cases. And Mr. Clinton has little beyond rhetoric to offer the nation's cities, either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one doubts the President's empathy with African-Americans. But empathy won't get anyone a job, housing or education. ''The problem with Clinton,'' says Roger Wilkins, the author and Johnson Administration civil-rights official, ''is he's like somebody who says I owe you some money, and I really want to pay you, but I had to stop by the gambling casino on the way to your house.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since big-government schemes for addressing social welfare are politically taboo, Mr. Wilkins says that if he were President, he would have convened the country's best mayors to identify their ''biggest problems and biggest successes'' in dealing with the crises of race and poverty in their own cities. These mayors -- of all races and both parties -- are on the front lines; every day the most creative and committed of them are trying out ''real ideas'' on ''real people''; their proposals for replicating their successes nationally and for targeted Federal funding to help do so would have the credibility that Washington programs do not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the President we do have -- and his political adversaries -- seem inclined to deal with the abstract rather than the concrete. If a year from now there is nothing to show for their efforts but a repeal of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and a loftily written Presidential report, they will truly have something to apologize for.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 54s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/399055159.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>How Jesse Helms Made a Difference</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Ronald Reagan was the sunny and optimistic face of modern conservatism, the uncompromisingly defiant exemplar of it was Jesse Helms, who died yesterday at age 86.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan has undergone a revisionist makeover by many historians who now recognize his accomplishments, Helms is still the conservative liberals most love to hate. But while they still disdain his views, many liberal groups are now using their own forms of the rhetorical and campaign techniques that Helms honed to perfection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jesse Helms was an influential television commentator in North Carolina when he decided to leave the Democratic Party, winning a U.S. Senate seat as a Republican in 1972. He went on to win four more terms, with a reputation as the Senate's most principled warrior on behalf of social conservatism, anti-Communism, limits on union power, and an assertive foreign policy that rejected State Department caution. Like Reagan, many of his views appear to have been validated. Others, such as his blind spot on racial issues and mean-spirited comments against gays were troublesome, but even the stubborn Helms made moves to modify his image in those areas late in life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two events early in his Senate career showcased Helms's unflinching nature and his political skills. In 1975, he engineered a visit to the U.S. by Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn over the objections of the State Department, which forbade its own employees from attending a major Solzhenitsyn speech in Washington. State also blocked a proposed visit to the White House, leading Helms to accuse President Gerald Ford of \"cowering timidly for fear of offending Communists.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That incident helped spur Reagan to challenge Ford for the GOP nomination the next year. Reagan lost the first five primaries, and he entered the North Carolina contest broke and under pressure to pull out. But Helms and his chief strategist Tom Ellis refused to give up. They employed Helms's huge, direct-mail list to build a grass-roots army of volunteers and raise money to air 30-minute speeches by Reagan across the state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Emphasizing the Panama Canal \"giveaway\" and smaller government, Reagan won an upset victory and was able to battle Ford all the way to the GOP convention. He showed such strength at the convention that Ford invited him to deliver off-the-cuff remarks to the delegates. Reagan was so inspiring that some of Ford's own delegates exclaimed, \"We just nominated the wrong candidate.\" Reagan later acknowledged how Helms's intervention rescued his political career.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that level of success eluded Helms in a Senate where he was almost always outvoted. Rather than seek compromise, he staked out firm positions that attracted publicity for his causes. He was often able to block appointments he considered too liberal and was the first to highlight United Nations corruption, an issue on which he was clearly ahead of his time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also stumbled. His anticommunist fervor led him to back authoritarian regimes in Chile and Argentina far more than he should have. His 1983 opposition to a Martin Luther King holiday -- he railed against King's associations with communists -- was myopic and a throwback to a discredited past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue of race will always cast a shadow on Helms's legacy. He could never understand why he was viewed by many as a bigot, having run one of the most integrated TV stations in the South and often hiring blacks on his staff. His criticisms of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and forced busing were on the mark. But as conservative scholar John Hood notes, \"he failed to marry every criticism of government overreaching with calls for the South's social and moral transformation and clear denunciations of racist business owners.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the mainstream media rarely put Helms's career in context the way they did, for example, with Sam Ervin, a Democrat who served with Helms in the Senate from North Carolina before retiring in 1975. Ervin was the leading legal strategist against Civil Rights legislation, and he largely crafted the Southern Manifesto against Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court case that ruled school segregation unconstitutional. But Ervin was the man who chaired the Watergate hearings that helped bring down Richard Nixon, and his views on civil rights were almost never mentioned. Both Helms and Ervin were courtly, principled conservatives. Only one became a cartoon media villain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contrary to his reputation, Helms did change his mind. For his first decade in office he opposed aid to Israel and in 1982, after that nation invaded Lebanon, called for \"shutting down\" relations. But after learning more about Israel's security fears during a visit there in 1985, and receiving assurances that officials there could support some military sales to moderate Arab nations, he became Israel's stalwart ally. \"It was a complete switch,\" recalls Morris Amitay, former executive director of AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Helms also softened on both AIDS and Africa. He developed an unlikely friendship with the rock star Bono, who convinced Helms to back AIDS funding and alleviate poverty in Africa by channeling more foreign aid through private sources.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that kind of detente was rare. Most liberals delighted in baiting Helms and he reciprocated: He crowed about how disappointed CBS anchor Dan Rather looked in announcing his upset victory on election night in 1990. But liberals did pay attention to Helms, and gradually adopted some of his methods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was Helms who first sent his own foreign policy advisers overseas to second-guess the executive branch's foreign policy. Many liberals have no qualms in doing the same today. One liberal consultant told me he learned from Helms's ability to distill complicated ideas to a level that connected with ordinary people. His mastery of new media techniques and technology convinced many liberals they had to invest in the Internet and build up the passions of their base.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jesse Helms was a major influence on American conservatism, but his career provides a blueprint for anyone who represents an embattled minority viewpoint. You can, with persistence and unflinching determination, change the political odds in your favor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Fund is a columnist for WSJ.com.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat Against ": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 7m 7s "}}
