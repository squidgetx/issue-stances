Many of the arguments against divestment as a general tactic are by now well known. They include practical ones, such as the difficulty of divesting fully when portfolios contain index funds, hedge funds and other complex instruments; concerns about adverse effects on the ability of endowments to support education and research as fully as they could if they were unconstrained; and doubts about the effectiveness of divestment in bringing about changes (which are often unspecified) in corporate practice. In general, I find these objections persuasive, though they need to be tested and debated in each situation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One argument in favor of divestment that I find entirely unpersuasive is the claim that a university is obligated to take a stand on any issue of broad social import that individuals - including, not infrequently, the president of a university acting in citizen mode! - regard as highly consequential. This is nonsense. To abstain is both a legitimate and appropriate action when the issue is not central to an institution's educational mission. Universities need to keep control over their agendas and decide for themselves when it is appropriate to take a position. An issue such as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> - which directly affects educational processes and outcomes - has a very different claim on academia than does the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Taking an institutional stand on political issues of many kinds threatens the primary educational mission of the university, which is to be avowedly open to arguments of every kind and to avoid giving priority to partisan or other political viewpoints. The university should be the home of the critic - indeed, the home of critics of many different persuasions - not the critic itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But my main quarrel with current debates over divestment is that they pay too little attention, if any attention at all, to what I regard as the insidious moral perils of divestment. There is, first of all, the sometime hypocrisy of seeking institutional \"purity\" while failing individually to reduce consumption of fossil fuels or, for a faculty member, to divest one's personal stake in investment vehicles, including index funds, that contain questionable holdings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, with regard to endowments, there is the question of an institution's obligation, seen as a matter of trust, to honor the intent of donors - many of whom surely gave money to endow specific activities, such as scholarships, believing that the institution would seek to earn as large a return as it prudently could.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, there is the very real danger that, as Macalester College President Brian Rosenberg has explained so well, joining the crowd in pushing for an institutional position on issues such as fossil fuels is too easy; it can tempt individuals to substitute such \"easy\" actions for their responsibility to act as citizens in pursuing more difficult courses of action, including working tirelessly in the political process. Of course, one can do both, but one wonders how often that happens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, these are times when educational institutions need to work harder, in my view, to improve educational outcomes, especially for less-privileged students. A related obligation is to seek new ways of controlling educational costs to address affordability issues that will not be solved, I suspect, by increased governmental support. At the institutional level, there are only so many dollars to spend, and only so many hours in the day to work on issues of consequence. Well- intentioned but poorly conceived efforts to compel colleges and universities to fight extramural battles of all kinds can impair efforts to work harder on issues of great social as well as educational consequence that are at the core of the basic educational mission of higher education. Such trade-offs receive too little - and sometimes no - consideration. And there is a slippery slope to be considered - divesting for one purpose can make it harder for the institution to resist other calls to use divestment as a political tactic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Searching for answers to the question of how to make one's greatest contribution to the common good is anything but easy, for institutions or for individuals. But it should be at the forefront of our thinking - not an afterthought.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is president emeritus of Princeton University and the Andrew W.

Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat Against ": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 48s "}}

By offering an alarmist interpretation of the fact that blacks as a group score 15 points lower than whites in I.Q. tests, the book's authors are, in their words, bravely tackling \"a taboo issue\" or, as their critics have it, recklessly fanning the flames of racial division in a nation already at the brink.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But isn't it also possible that a publisher is simply hawking a book?  The incendiary \"science\" in \"The Bell Curve\" is not new; its policy prescriptions are conservative boilerplate. Had the authors compared the I.Q. scores of men and women, that might have been a cry of \"Fire!\" in a societal tinderbox. As \"The Bell Curve\" stands, however, Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein might be more accurately charged with rehashing the work of others (and sometimes their own) for financial and political profit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of those others is William Shockley, a memorable nut who argued a quarter-century ago in favor of sterilizing those with low I.Q.'s.  Shockley receives only one guarded paragraph in the 845 pages of \"The Bell Curve.\" Yet his old pronouncements are everywhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shockley attributed the lower income and higher crime rates of blacks to the same 15-point I.Q. test differential. He concluded that \"a major cause of American Negroes' intellectual and social deficit is hereditary and racially genetic\" and \"not remediable to a major degree by practical improvement in environment.\" He bemoaned welfare for encouraging the procreation of the population's \"least effective elements,\" black and white.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more elegantly written \"Bell Curve\" has the same drift. Shockley bequeathed its authors their self-congratulatory tone as well: He boasted about raising \"questions that are usually swept under the rug\" as they do about breaking taboos. Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein also emulate Shockley by asserting expertise in academic disciplines (like genetics) outside their own and by protesting too much against those who might accuse them of making a fetish of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the \"Bell Curve\" authors cannot add to the science and pseudo-science they selectively cull from their primary sources, they update Shockley's politics for the 1990's (<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should be abolished along with welfare) and tack on apocalyptic predictions of the sort found in best sellers heralding the next economic crash. \"The Bell Curve\" imagines a polarized, totalitarian Futureworld where the I.Q. elite will confine the dumb poor to a high-tech \"Indian reservation.\" And how could this be prevented? Rather than provide answers requiring original thought, the authors fade off into a nostalgic paean to old-fashioned, self-governing neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anyone looking for fresh, specific ideas about overhauling welfare -- and who isn't? -- will not find them in \"The Bell Curve.\" Instead there is padding: enough equivocating disclaimers for another \"Hamlet,\" and a mother lode of graphs designed to lend the book an air of unimpeachable authority, much as all those radar maps impart meteorological gravity to Willard Scott.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the authors concede their bell curves can be ignored. Lest they lose a single low-I.Q. customer, they announce in a revealingly caste-obsessed preface that their book is \"only about 30 pages long\" if read \"at the simplest level,\" since there are italicized Cliffs Notes throughout. The graph-packed main text is \"accessible to anyone who enjoys reading, for example, the science section of the news magazines,\" but the appendices that follow are suitable for only the very smartest -- no doubt the Asians who perform highest on I.Q. tests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such clever merchandising may make \"The Bell Curve\" the best-selling unread book since the last novel by Umberto Eco. Then again, Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein may have outsmarted themselves. A book that blames low I.Q.'s for what ails America may have tough sledding in a culture where even conservatives have been rushing to deify the 75 I.Q. of Forrest Gump.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 59s "}}

They're showing that this mayor--this son of the Old Guard--is trying hard to right old wrongs and create opportunities for blacks and Hispanics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True, his commitment to integrating the police and fire commands may be more a product of political peacekeeping than a craving for justice, but compared to the union bosses, Daley is performing like a latter-day Lincoln.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the vicious and misleading radio commercials being run by the Fraternal Order of Police to whip up resentment against Daley's use of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in police promotions. The spot begins with a mock \"auction\" of sergeant's stripes to the highest bidder. An authoritative voice warns ominously that the bad old days of political clout have returned to the police promotion process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this because the city, in an effort to get more black and Hispanic sergeants and lieutenants, is going to base 30 percent of the next promotional draft on job performance, not just test scores.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's the moaning and wailing of the Chicago Fire Fighters Union, which in 32 months of contract negotiations resisted a similar method to get more black and Hispanic lieutenants, captains and battalion chiefs. Finally, union leaders agreed grudgingly to basing 10 percent of promotions on performance rather than test scores, but only when the city agreed to pay the salaries of the top three union officers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's a union, 31 percent of whose members are black or Hispanic, holding out against Daley's efforts to promote an equitable number of blacks and Hispanics. Here's a union in which not a single minority has been elected to the governing board from its 13 city districts. Here's a union that gives full voting rights to retired members, who are predominantly white, and barely gives the time of day to nearly a third of its active membership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So it falls to the Daley administration to produce a police and fire service that reflects, if not mirrors, the racial and ethnic makeup of the entire city. And progress must be eked out in spite of the unions, not because of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for black and Hispanic police and firefighters who complain the city is moving too slowly, it is they who need to gear up and get organized. It takes hard work to exert power within a union, just as it takes hard work to get ready for an exam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Minority shots at Daley, like those from the unions, only reinforce the perception that the mayor has got this one about right.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Strongly In Favor": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 16s "}}

Rosenthal is on vacation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''You have to distinguish between means and ends,'' Albert Carnesale said. ''What's important here is the end, diversity. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> is just one means to that end.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Carnesale is the new Chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles, a great public university in a diverse city. He moved here in July from Harvard, where he was dean of the Kennedy School and then provost. He arrived at a turning point for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new policy of the Regents of the University of California, effective this year at the graduate school level, forbids giving preference in admissions on the basis of race or ethnicity. Proposition 209, which has just gone into effect, makes that a rule for all state institutions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result of the Regents' policy, the number of Hispanic and black students at the U.C.L.A. Law School has dropped sharply. Last year 104 blacks were admitted, this year 21. Of the 21, only 8 enrolled. (At Boalt Hall, the University of California Law School at Berkeley, none of the black students admitted this year actually came.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Al Carnesale, figures like those -- and what they indicate may happen in undergraduate admissions -- represent a profound challenge. He outlined three reasons he believes diversity is essential to U.C.L.A. fulfilling its responsibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''First,'' he said, ''we have to provide the best possible education for our students. And I have no doubt that education is markedly advanced by diversity -- because students learn from each other. Teaching foreign policy at Harvard, I saw it at work. The differences in perspectives were so informative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Second, it is our responsibility to prepare leaders for all segments of our society. We are a public university. And the way to do that is to provide high-quality education for potential leaders in all groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Third, one of the things that sets the United States apart is access to social and economic mobility. And the key to that is education. Go around the table at a meeting of business leaders, and half the stories you hear will have violins playing in the background.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Carnesale feels strongly about that, it is because his own story has plenty of violins in the background. He was brought up in a Bronx tenement near Yankee Stadium, the son of a taxi driver, and then lived the American dream: Bronx High School of Science, nuclear engineer, adviser to Presidents on arms control.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''What can we do to maintain diversity now?'' he asked. ''We can encourage minority students whose records make them eligible to apply, and then encourage those admitted to enroll. We have to make sure people know they're welcome. In fact, the message is that they're wanted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''In the medium term, we have to get more minorities eligible. It means we have to be much more engaged in the high schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''In the long run, there has to be something like equal opportunity for all kids to get a good education in this country. Better-off people will always have an advantage, but equal opportunity should be a goal, an aspiration.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The passage of Proposition 209 may make people think that California now requires the university to admit students solely on the basis of academic scores. That is not so. In fact, the rules require that at least 25 percent of each class admitted reflect qualities apart from school records and test results.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''We use <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> all the time,'' Mr. Carnesale said. ''It is not by looking at academic merits alone that we have a football team with a 9-2 record, going to a bowl.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''In going over applications for admission you notice that applicants come from different countries, or this one plays the cello, or that one is a published poet or has overcome great personal obstacles in her life. We may notice all those things -- but not race or ethnicity or gender.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fact is that, in California and everywhere, values apart from test scores do figure in university admissions policies -- and should. A society that has prospered in diversity cannot want monochrome higher education.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is the main subject.": "1"}, "stance": {"Strongly In Favor": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 39s "}}

Today President Clinton will be at Central High to open the door for the nine men and women whose courageous walk opened doors for so many others. He will be introduced by student body president Fatima McKendra, honor student, aspiring surgeon, African American. This young woman could not have been student body president in 1957.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How far have we really come in 40 years? How far have we left to go? I was 2 years old when those brave students walked through angry, jeering crowds, past armed soldiers to the front door of Central High. It was not until years later that, as an African American teenager, I had the occasion to go to school with white children in Marianna, Ark.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And still it was not easy. After my school canceled a program celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, students staged a sit-in. They were chased from the school grounds by firemen spraying them with high-powered blasts of water. The student officers, including myself, who had been meeting in the principal's office were taken to the police station. We did not go back to school that year. And when I did go back, I was not allowed to play sports, a severe penalty for someone who later went to college on a football and academic scholarship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a watershed experience for me. I learned that you have to take a stand in what you believe is right. There is always a cost. But often there is a higher cost for not taking a stand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tolerance actually got an early start in Arkansas. The University of Arkansas law and medical schools had been integrated since 1948. The city of Little Rock already had desegregated its public buses, its zoo, its library and its parks system, and its citizens were poised to deal with integration in a positive way. They were guided by what President Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. But the actions of a few encouraged the lesser angels to manifest themselves. Notwithstanding, justice prevailed, the school was integrated and Ernest Green, the lone senior of the Little Rock Nine, graduated in May 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We have come a long way since then. Our economy is healthy, unemployment is low, and the African American middle class has grown substantially.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But despite our progress, we are slowed by unfinished business. We still are wary of those different from us. Too often, we talk less to each other and more at each other, if we talk at all. As terrible as things were 40 years ago, at least people knew exactly where they stood. Things were out in the open and on the table. Ironically, racism clad in a hooded sheet was much more identifiable than much of the racism of today, which often wears a smile and a business suit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, problems 40 years ago were more blatant. What we face today is more subtle, but still insidious. We get a glimpse when we hear about demeaning conversations in corporate boardrooms. Or when <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> rules are lifted at state universities and minority enrollment plummets. Or when academics and writers fall back on discredited arguments to justify persistent stereotypes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And tensions now go beyond the conflict between black and white: the vile burning of churches, a resurgence of antisemitism and hostility toward new immigrants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we have to learn to live together, because the face of America is changing. Today in Hawaii, everyone is a minority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon this will be true of California. And 40 years from now, there will be no majority race in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can look at statistics and know what America will look like in the 21st century. But we have to look inside ourselves to determine what America will be like in the 21st century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president is asking all Americans to join him in a national conversation about race to face one another honestly across lines that still divide us. Clearly, now is the time for honest dialogue, the time to build a society that recognizes the worth of all people and honors the dignity of every person.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until every American has real economic opportunity and first-rate educational opportunity, there will be disparities that will look like racial discrimination, whether they are or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Melba P.

Historically, it celebrates a lone Mexican victory in a war that Mexico lost: On May 5, 1862, in Puebla, Mexico, an indigent indigenous force under Gen.

From San Ysidro on the border to Santa Rosa in the north, from Santa Cruz on the coast to San Bernardino in the desert, California claims 57 towns and cities named after santos. To paraphrase a popular aphorism: Poor California, with so many santos and so far from God! Gov. Wilson would probably add, \"And so close to Mexico.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California is my adopted state, by virtue of a mixed marriage. I'm from Texas, she's from California. This remarkable state has grown on me the way I outgrew Texas, years layered one over the other. I now admit a love for California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Texas, it was a love-hate relationship. Relations between Texans and Texanos were pitched with overt racism, not the subtle style I found here 20 years ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, Proposition 187 and the anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> initiative make me feel like I'm right back in Texas. There's a vigilante mood here not unlike that of a century ago. Even Texans are surprised at California's vehemence and, being more experienced, are wooing Mexican business away from Califas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, my attachment to California is so strong that I feel magnetized. I feel it through a melancholic sadness, an enchanting nostalgia for the California that has always been there, through the cities and towns named after spiritual ghosts, through the floods, earthquakes, fires and riots.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a mysterious energy that drives California to lead the nation in spiritual and temporal fashions, in sensational crimes, lifestyles, inventions and discoveries. Some believe it is the massive fields of energy from the ocean, from the deep blue sky or the energy that seeps up through the faults in the earth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My California dreams began in the late 1940s in west Texas. Our home was on a street that turned into the highway that led beyond the New Mexico sunsets. We were always waving goodby to family friends and their kids, piled into ancient cars on their way to the golden state of opportunity, to California. A year or two later, some would return from California to culture-shock us. I had never seen Mexican women in hip-hugging pedal-pushers. The kids no longer spoke Spanish. The men showed off their late-model station wagons boasting California license plates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California was the coolest. During the '50s, a time of adolescent innocence, everything from California was cool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Texas, you could spot a California short-sleeve shirt a block away by the color and design. \"California threads?\" we would ask any proud vato wearing a snappy camisa. We would rub the cloth between our fingers. From there, our fingers would walk up to the shirt pocket, pull out a cigarette from his pack, and say \"Nice shirt, man! California?\" It became a way to bum cigarettes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most Texanos had always identified as Mexicanos, Mexican Americans; in the barrios and the military, it was always Chicanos. When the Chicano movement exploded in California, many of us ridiculed those psuedo-\"Dons\" with dark Indian faces asserting their \"Spanish\" heritage. But it wasn't long before I was swept by the crusading likes of modern Californios such as Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, Ernesto Galarza, Ignacio Lopez, Luisa Moreno and Bert Corona. Other crusaders came along: Vilma Martinez, Antonia Hernandez, Herman Gallegos, Alurista and Jose Montoya, farm workers, attorneys, union activists, artists, poets-all migrants and immigrants, not one of these leaders born in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They reckoned this had to be their land after working its soil. They had grown to love the campos and the towns named after the santos their mothers and grandmothers lit votive candles and prayed to when their children migrated to California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now it's ours. We are Californians. And in this state that would rank as the third-most-populated Spanish-speaking country in the world, we can say, proudly and happily, Viva el Cinco de Mayo!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: JOSE ANTONIO BURCIAGA</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jose Antonio Burciaga is a Northern California writer, the author of \"Drink Cultura\" and \"Spilling the Beans,\" to be published in June by Joshua Odell Editions, Santa Barbara.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 16s "}}

But right now Bradley should not distract attention from Al Gore, whose difficulties multiply. And Bradley's recent foray into the politics of ideas did not make sensible people impatient for his next foray.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gore knows that serving vice presidents who have wanted their parties' nominations have succeeded recently (Nixon in 1960, Humphrey in 1968, Bush in 1988). However, Bush in 1988 was the first incumbent vice president since Van Buren in 1836 to win the presidency. Bush won partly because a contented electorate wanted the closest thing to a third Reagan term. Not many voters next year are going to be thinking, \"Gosh, it would be really neat to prolong the Clinton years!\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats worry about polls that show George W. Bush, about whom voters know little, handily beating Gore in places like Michigan. This in the record 97th month of peacetime economic expansion. And Gore keeps saying strange things. Never mind his I-was-a- hardscrabble-farmer and his I-invented-the-Internet riffs. Consider two recent beauties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pressed by some environmentalists to support aggressive measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars and coal-burning power plants, Gore responded that he's on their side, but challenged them: \"Name a senator who would support me.\" Does it occur to him that there might be something wrong with an agenda opposed by 100 senators?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recently Gore, speaking of his book \"Earth in the Balance,\" told Time magazine: \"There's not a statement in that book that I don't endorse. Not one. The evidence has firmed up the positions I sketched there.\" Oh? What fresh evidence confirms that ours is a \"dysfunctional civilization\"? Or that automobiles pose \"a mortal threat to the security of every nation that is more deadly than that of any military enemy we are ever again likely to confront\"? Should we then be bombing Detroit instead of Serbia?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The certitude that Gore radiates carries an undercurrent of moral preening -- the suggestion that people who come to different conclusions are morally as well as intellectually flawed. On the evidence of Bradley's recent speech on race, he can match Gore stride for stride in the sanctimony sweepstakes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bradley's speech at Cooper Union in Manhattan was long on earnestness. We all should \"look deeper into the soul of America\" and pursue \"racial healing\" which is thwarted by \"white indifference and black suspicion\" and \"the deadwood of superstition, fear and fantasy.\" Many white Americans \"harbor absurd stereotypes about all people of color.\" We need \"candid talk.\" And so on.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is familiar. On July 10, 1991, in a remarkably unpleasant \"open letter\" to President Bush, Bradley accused Bush of hypocrisy and of \"shamelessly\" engaging in \"race-baiting.\" On July 16, 1991, Bradley implicitly praised himself for \"speaking candidly\" and for the \"moral courage\" to avoid \"easy evasions\" about race by faulting others for not speaking as he does. His \"candid talk\" included falsely accusing Ronald Reagan of saying that \"all female black Americans are welfare queens.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He even left the impression that the surge of murders among young blacks after 1984 was the result of Republican presidents, not crack cocaine. On April 30, 1992, after the Los Angeles riots following the initial acquittal of the police in the Rodney King case, Bradley again described America as \"a society that does not talk honestly about race.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bradley's belief that Americans are not sufficiently and properly preoccupied with race may resonate among Democratic activists. Many of them endorse identity politics, the theory that individuals are decisively shaped and irrevocably defined not by reasoned choices but by accidents of birth and socialization -- by membership in a racial, ethnic or sexual group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, it is arguable that identity politics, and obsessing about race, is a plague. Bradley wants to \"overcome our divisions\" and \"get to a time when, in Toni Morrison's words, `race exists, but it doesn't matter.' \" But his self-advertised candor does not extend to even considering the possibility that reaching such a time is made more difficult by some things Democrats cherish -- <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, categorical representation (the theory that the interests of a group can only be understood and represented by members of that group) and the rest of the racial spoils system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bradley cannot hope -- who can? -- to beat Gore in the sanctimony sweepstakes. So he should avoid implying that America's failure to measure up to his standard of racial honesty results not from honest differences of opinions among decent people, but from the moral inadequacies of those who do not share his opinions.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat Against ": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 18s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/215497350.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>For the sake of argument</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daniel Patrick Moynihan was a great minder of Senate traditions and a stirring elected intellectual, perhaps Washington's last.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he sponsored no major legislation, was not the prophet he thinks he was - and never learned the difference between being right and being effective. By Jacob Weisberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On a steamy Wednesday in August, Pat Moynihan rode with his family up Pennsylvania Avenue, a street he helped to resurrect, to the White House, a building where he once worked, to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award that 37 years ago he assisted in creating. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who hopes to inherit his seat in the Senate, began the ceremony in the East Room. Bill Clinton, whose departure from office will conclude eight years of strife with Moynihan, presented the award. On most of the 15 recipients, the president bestowed kisses and bear-hugs. But as Moynihan bowed his head to receive his medal, Clinton simply clasped his hand and whispered something in his ear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Moynihan looked a bit abstracted as Clinton fitted the ribbon around his neck, it might have been because the room was, for him, full of ghosts: the four presidents he served (Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford) and the four he mostly fought from the Senate (Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton). Half the other honorees were people the 73-year-old senator has been enmeshed with at one point or another in his career: Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund and for many years his nemesis on welfare policy; John Kenneth Galbraith, one of Moynihan's predecessors as ambassador to India,. his colleague on the Harvard faculty and his neighbor in Cambridge; George McGovern, who led the Democrats in the era when Moynihan felt compelled to break with them; and the widow of Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, who was one of Moynihan's closest friends in the Senate. Another honoree, the Rev. Gardner Taylor of Brooklyn, approached Moynihan before the ceremony to apologize for his attack on Moynihan's 1965 report - once infamous and now widely praised - on the black family. At the reception afterward, Moynihan seemed to return to the present as he sipped a glass of white wine and regaled the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, and a White House speechwriter, Jeff Shesol, with the story of how the Presidential Medal came to be. John F. Kennedy, who wanted to create a system of civil honors akin to those bestowed in Britain, referred the project to his labor secretary, Arthur Goldberg. After Goldberg went to the Supreme Court, the task fell to Moynihan, who tried to pre-empt opposition to the award by pretending it had always existed. But only after Kennedy was assassinated did his idea come to fruition. Lyndon Johnson awarded the first medal posthumously to the late president along with the other recipients Kennedy had chosen (with less evident political purpose than the Clintons) - among them, E. B. White, Edward Steichen and Edmund Wilson. At the ceremony, Jacque-, line Kennedy sat behind a screen in the White House State Dining Room and wept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You often see eyes glaze over when Moynihan starts in on one of these responsible-for-the-creation riffs, especially if the listeners have heard the story a few times before. In a capital seemingly ever consumed with the latest dust-up, where historical memory tends to be measured in days rather than decades, Moynihan's elaborations of neglected historical corridors, lost moments and failed schemes tend to be seen as exercises in irrelevance and self-regard. It isn't so much that no one in Washington takes Moynihan seriously, though his dysfunctional relationship with Clinton did consign him in recent years to a state of near irrelevancy in the Senate. It is rather that it is not easy to settle on how to take Moynihan seriously. He was, and remains, a complex and often contradictory figure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Moynihan, I think, the strains of courage, egotism, insight and petulance have always been blended together. After 24 years in the Senate, he leaves behind a record that is long on concepts and short on concrete results. Yet the Senate will be a poorer place without him. In the end, the verdict on Pat Moynihan may be that he was a frustrating conundrum: our political era's most magnificent failure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE the Medal of Freedom ceremony, I visited Moynihan in his private office in the Capitol. Others who are senior enough .to have been be-. stowed one of these coveted hideaways off the Senate floor use them as private meeting rooms or as places to catch a nap. Moynihan turned his into a writer's studio, a place to escape his staff and hammer out drafts on the 70's-vintage Smith Corona typewriter that sits on a desk in the center of the room. (An identical model graces Moynihan's office in an old one-room schoolhouse in Pindars Corners, N.Y, the upstate hamlet where he and his wife, Elizabeth, have long had a farm.) The room is filled with books and pictures, any of which will prompt a story. The most poignant is a small black-and-white photograph of Robert Kennedy that looks over Moynihan's desk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The senator himself makes an impression more professorial than official. His dress is anglophile and mildly eccentric: this afternoon, a beige suit and striped tie worn with red socks and leather-soled suede shoes. And when Moynihan, in a self-described mellow mood, begins what turns into a three-hour ramble, it is in the mannered dialect that everyone who has ever worked for him can imitate: a singsong of \"ah-ah-ahs\" punctuated by staccato pops of commentary, with seemingly random accelerations, decelerations and abnormal stresses added for effect.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about health care, Moynihan begins by asking, \"In ... what dec-ade ... of this century was the ran-dom patient ... with the random ailment ... encountering the random doctor betteroffforcare?\" (His answer: \"Ah, the, ah, fifth decade. .. . Penicillin ... was probably when they stopped hurt-ing people.\") After Moynihan suggests I turn off my tape recorder and breaks out a bottle of sherry his lazily brilliant banter grows even more compelling. At one point, for example, a call to the hideaway from his wife, an expert in the gardens of Mogul India and also his chief political adviser, prompted an elaboration of her recent discoveries about the original design of the Taj Mahal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite his seemingly endless erudition, Moynihan is not a pedant. He is someone with a keen awareness of the past's presence. I remember watching Moynihan's performance during the debate on the Persian Gulf war, one of those rare recent occasions when senators actually showed up and took their seats. Most gave ghostwritten comments retailing arguments familiar to anyone who'd been following the debate. Moynihan gave an original, discursive lecture on the history of the British Mandate in Iraq and international law, the point of which was that Kuwait was a nasty country not worth defending. His conclusion that America shouldn't go to war may look like a mistake in retrospect. But Moynihan put the issue in a perspective that was otherwise lacking that day. In the world's greatest deliberative body, he was one of just a few who could fairly be described as deliberating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whoever succeeds him is bound to seem a minor figure by comparison. Neither Rick Lazio nor Hillary Clinton will ever approach Moynihan in intellect, style or wit. It's also a safe assumption that either one of them will view the job of senator far more narrowly than Moynihan did. They will try to leave their imprint on legislation, deliver federal dollars back to New York, service their constituents and get re-elected. They will spend their spare moments not writing, thinking and debating, but fund-raising and \"listening.\" In other words, they will try to be effective in ways that most senators now are, but that Moynihan never was.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The New Fronierstan Moynihan serving as an adviser in the Kennedy administration, with Vice President Johnson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaving the Left</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Robert Kennedy in 1967, the year he called the liberal left \"rigid and destructive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican Interlude President-elect Nixon announcing the selection of Moynihan as his chief domestic policy adviser.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Pragmatic Intellectual</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan in 1981, during his first term as senator</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>from New York. He was elected in 1976.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a parochial way, New Yorkers will probably be better off. Moynihan has spent 24 years pointing out the imbalance of finances that afflicts New York in an annual report he calls \"the fisc.\" A Senator Clinton or a Senator Lazio would spend less time trying to understand this problem and more time laying claim to a few more defense contracts. That's how Charles Schumer views the job, as did the man he replaced, Alfonse D'Amato. As Moynihan's friend John Chafee once joked: \"You write Moynihan about a passport and you get a history of the passport office. You write D'Amato about a passport and you get the passport.\" With Lazio or Clinton, you'll get the passport.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Senate will surely be worse off, having lost its greatest character, its sole intellectual, its chief gadfly and its finest literary stylist. And it will also have lost something more. Though he is far from a type, Moynihan is the last of the breed that the framers of the Constitution envisioned residing in the upper chamber. Their notion of a bicameral legislative branch was that the lower house would be fully representative, while the upper house would be only indirectly so, providing a check on momentary enthusiasms and majoritarian passions. In contrast to the House, the Senate was to be more about policy than politics, focused on national rather than local concerns and geared to slowing things down through careful deliberation rather than making things happen. Visiting Washington in the 1830's, Alexis de Tocqueville found the intended distinction borne out in practice. \"When one enters the House of Representatives at Washington,\" he wrote, \"one is struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. One can often look in vain for a single famous man. . . . A couple of paces away is the entrance to the Senate, whose narrow precincts contain a large proportion of the famous men of America. They are eloquent advocates, wise magistrates and noted statesmen. Every word uttered in this assembly would add luster to the greatest parliamentary debates in Europe.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan is perhaps the only contemporary senator recognizable in this description. His departure will solidify a change decades in the making: the debasement of the Senate into a glorified version of the more vulgar, impatient and partisan House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO BEgan following Moynihan only in the 1990's sometimes find it hard to understand why an older generation regards him so highly. In the last decade, Moynihan has not been an essential figure in American politics. Rather, his role has often seemed that of a character actor with a stock gag. He wanders onstage to make brilliant remarks, the real point of which seem to be to point out the feebleness of those who fail to appreciate his genius. During the Clinton presidency, his part has been that of the Shakespearean fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One might have expected Moynihan to delight in Clinton's election. Here, after all, was a president whose intellect approached his own and one who shared his self-critical outlook on liberalism. And for a moment, it looked as if Moynihan would be Clinton's collaborator. \"Whatever the president wants, I'll certainly try to get it for him,\" the senator announced in 1993 upon succeeding Lloyd Bentsen as chairman of the all-important Finance Committee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As soon became evident, however, this offer was entirely hollow. The embattled relationship that ensued can be analyzed at several levels. At the most basic, Moynihan disagreed with the administration. He thought Clinton should first fulfill his campaign promise to reform welfare, the topic nearest the senator's heart. The Clintons wanted to begin with health care, a subject Moynihan had never mastered. On a more general level, Moynihan's learned skepticism about government social policy was a poor match for the optimism and naivete of the first Democratic administration in 12 years. The Clinton people thought they could use social policy to change the world. Moynihan had, after considerable delay, assimilated the failures of the Great .Society he wrote about 25 years earlier. He cited Rossi's Law, so named for the sociologist Peter Rossi: \"the expected value for any measured effect of a social program is zero.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, at a personal level, there was Moynihan's vanity. The Clintons made a tactical mistake by not love-bombing Moynihan early on. On the other hand, it's possible that no amount of flattery would have been sufficient. Relations took a disastrous turn when Moynihan read a blind quote in Time magazine about himself from a \"top administration official\": \"Moynihan supported Bob Kerrey during the primaries. He's not one of us, and he can't control Finance like Bentsen did. He's cantankerous, but he couldn't obstruct us even if he wanted to. . . . We'll roll right over him if we have to.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan says he knows the quote came from Rahm Emanuel, a Clinton aide. Emanuel, who now works as an investment banker in Chicago, says it wasn't he. In any case, the \"roll over him\" remark pushed Moynihan from skeptic to enemy. Demanding a welfare reform bill, he announced, \"I might just hold health care hostage.\" He went on \"Meet the Press\" to declare: \"We don't have a health care crisis in this country. We do have a welfare crisis.\" Later, he called the proposed budgetary savings in the Hillary Clinton-Ira Magaziner health care bill \"a fantasy.\" Worst of all, he declined to hold Finance Committee hearings on the bill. \"I probably was more assertive than was in order,\" he says today, with considerable understatement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of Moynihan's criticisms were on the mark. He was correct in arguing that a major piece of social legislation like health care reform shouldn't pass the way the Clinton team thought it could - by a slim, partisan majority. Moynihan was also right in asserting that politically, it would have been wiser to do welfare reform first. But in other respects, Moynihan was mistaken. He became fixated on the idea that health care inflation was caused by the phenomenon of \"cost disease,\" an ailment diagnosed by his friend the New York University economist William Baumol, who developed it in relation to the economics of the performing arts. Because productivity increases are not possible in certain service industries, Baumol postulated, costs rise inexorably Moynihan had Baumol testify before the Finance Committee, and then had Hillary Clinton to lunch at his Pennsylvania Avenue apartment to meet with Baumol.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Baumol's disease doesn't afflict health care, an industry in which magnificent productivity increases have proven possible thanks to medical technology and pharmaceuticals. The cause of runaway health care inflation, as the Clinton social engineers understood, was a third-party-payer system in which users had no incentives to limit the expenses they generated. Thanks mainly to the rise of managed care, medical inflation was declining even as Moynihan repeated his analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he now think he was wrong about all this? \"I guess I was,\" Moynihan told me. \"You start getting robots to do the work and you start getting pills to do the work. One pill, Zantac, cut the number of stomach operations by 80 percent.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>if he missed this trend, it may have been because Moynihan's motivation wasn't to repair health care. Baumol was proxy for his view of grand social policy schemes in general - that they inevitably cost far more than we expect, have massive unintended consequences and often fail to make the problem better. Given the possibility that the Clinton plan might pass, Moynihan wanted to be the one who predicted its failure. It was as if he were burying a time capsule of dire warnings that would one day be viewed as prophetic. More than he wanted to shape the outcome, Moynihan wanted to have been right.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something of this phenomenon affected Moynihan's curious behavior in the welfare battie that followed the one over health care. With his vast credibility on the subject of welfare, Moynihan was the logical focal point for a bill that would bring together New Democrats and conservatives. After Republicans took the Congress in 1994, Moynihan, alone in his party, could have shaped what kind of reform bill Congress would pass. Instead, he became first a sphinx, who would not tell anyone the secret of what he supported, then a Cassandra, who screamed bloody murder about what others were trying to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of the problem was Moynihan's pride of authorship in a reform bill that passed in 1988, the Family Support Act. It's possible to argue that the 1988 bill opened the door to the more effective conditioning of welfare benefits on work that was passed in 1996. But Moynihan seemed to take the position that the very discussign of the topic implied that his attempt of eight years earlier had failed - which, in fact, it had. The other part of the problem was his view that illegitimacy, a major factor in the lives of welfare recipients, was too little understood and too hard to discuss openly to support an effective governmental response.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once Republicans captured Congress and passed an actual bill containing a stringent version of time-limited welfare, Moynihan became uncharacteristically hysterical, arguing that it would put thousands of children in the streets. He had found something worse than grandiose social policy efforts by liberals - radical reform by conservatives. Moynihan's horrified opposition to the bill was persuasive to many at the time (myself included). But while the final verdict may not be written until the next economic downturn, mounting evidence suggests that he was wrong. Unlike all previous welfare reform efforts, the Personal Responsibility Act has reduced welfare rolls considerably - by more than 50 percent. Births out of wedlock, which began to decline in 1994, have continued to do so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's relations with the administration, meanwhile, grew worse. \"I kept getting into sort of unnecessary troubles,\" he says. He leapt at the opportunity in a \"Meet the Press\" appearance to call for an independent counsel investigation of Whitewater, which he now refers to as \"something I should never have done.\" He also maligned the administration gratuitously. In a meeting at The New York Post after the 1996 campaign finance scandal, Moynihan cracked to the paper's editorial board: \"Everyone has Chinese arms merchants to lunch. Don't you?\" IN RETROSPECT, IT IS CLINTON WHO APpears to have been right about many of the major economic and social policy issues of the 1990's, while Moynihan was making a muddle of his past positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What went wrong?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To understand why the 90's were so unkind to Moynihan's reputation, you have to know something of his past. And this is murky territory, dominated by a subject who loves to revise his own history and cultivate his own myths. For instance, Moynihan has never made any real effort to correct the widely held belief that he grew up in the urban jungle of New York's Hell's Kitchen. In fact, as was noted in a recent biography of Moynihan written by his friend, the English journalist Godfrey Hodgson, Moynihan \"didn't sleep a night in Hell's Kitchen until he had a college degree and a commission in the United States Navy.\" He was born in 1927 in Oklahoma, where his fathey worked as a reporter. As a young child, Pat lived in comfortable middle-class environs in Queens, Nassau County and suburban New Jersey. But when he was 10, his alcoholic father abandoned his family, never to be seen again by his eldest son. The family fell into a downward spiral, and Pat did spend some time in East Harlem. The Hell's Kitchen interlude, however, occurred in 1947, when Pat, on his way from the Navy to Tufts, worked as a substitute bartender in a saloon his mother ran for a time on West 42nd Street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Fulbright Scholarship took Moynihan to the London School of Economics, where he underwent a theatrical transformation. The self-consciously working-class Irish roustabout molted into an English dandy, replete with bowler hat, monocle and umbrella. But the career Moynihan sought upon his return was in politics, not scholarship. Moynihan met a well-connected New York lawyer on the boat ride back, which led to a job on Robert Wagner's campaign for mayor, which led to a job working on Averell Harriman's campaign forgovernor and then to a speechwriting job on Harriman's staff in Albany</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>upstate Retreat</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan at his farm in Pindars Corners, about 70 miles west of Albany. The Irrelevant Senator With President Clinton.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clashes with the new administration put Moynihan on the outside in policy formulation, despite the disdain</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>he shared with Clinton for the traditional left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan joined the Kennedy administration in 1961 after a friend recommended him to Arthur Goldberg, the newly appointed secretary of labor. Despite intense ambition and efforts to ingratiate himself, Moynihan never penetrated the Kennedy inner circle. By the time J.AK. was assassinated, however he had begun to make a mark with projects like his effort to revive Pennsylvania Avenue and his study \"One Third of a Nation,\" which contended that many young men, poorly educated and untrained, faced lifetimes of unemployment or work in low-skill jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He no longer had to worry about making a name for himself after the spring of 1965, when controversy erupted over another study he wrote for the Labor Department, \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,\" a k a the Moynihan Report. The story of the report, the hostile reception it received from many civil rights leaders and its subsequent vindication has been told many times. To read it today is to be struck by the continued trenchancy of Moynihan's insight that family breakup was becoming the chief obstacle to the goal of racial equality, and also by its style - one of analytical boldness out of character for a government report, even one intended for internal consumption.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing on work by the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and the historian of slavery Stanley Elkins, Moynihan diagnosed a crisis in the structure of the black family. American slavery had been especially vicious, forbidding marriage and denying men the ability to provide for their families. This had encouraged a \"matrifocal\" family structure, which was worsened by racism and discrimination. With few economic opportunities, black men could not be good husbands and fathers. This led them to a pattern Moynihan was only too familiar with: desertion, disordered one-parent households and what he called in a phrase from the sociologist Kenneth Clark, a \"tangle of pathology.\" One-parent families produced a disproportionate number of delinquents, dropouts and drug abusers. Moynihan also noted a salient fact: the number of new welfare cases, which had previously tracked the unemployment rate for blacks, had begun to rise even as unemployment fell. This suggested that antidiscrimination laws were insufficient to the goal of racial equality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To that end, Moynihan supported a range of policies designed to enhance \"the stability and resources of the Negro American family\" jobs programs, housing programs, birth control assistance and what came to be known as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. But because his goal was to stimulate a government commitment to addressing the problem, Moynihan's report did not pursue the question of what remedies might work best. In part, this was a reaction to the War on Poverty debate his side had just lost. Moynihan, coming from Labor, wanted a jobs program. Sargent Shriver and others from the newly formed Office of Economic Opportunity were attracted to the modish strategy of \"community action,\" which meant involving poor people in the programs created to help them. Moynihan didn't want to dissuade the Johnson administration from acting by reviving the quarrel. At another level, passing from diagnosis to cure meant moving from the realm of the known to what was perhaps unknowable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Giving short shrift to solutions proved, however, to be a major political blunder. Because it de-emphasized the question of what government should do to help the black family, the Moynihan Report was taken by many on the left as potential fodder for racists who believed blacks were inferior and government could do nothing to help them. His depiction of blacks as deeply damaged by the vicious character of American slavery was taken as criticism of blacks rather than of white society. But it was the attention Moynihan paid to rising out-of-wedlock births that sparked the greatest outrage. While few disputed his statistics,. many civil rights leaders took the position that for a white man to deliver this news to a white audience could bring only harm. In the famous formulation, Moynihan was \"blaming the victim\"; he was also accused of both subtle and explicit racism. The Labor Department disowned the report. President Johnson, who may not have ever read it, ignored it. Moynihan resigned and relocated to New York City, where he began an unsuccessful campaign for the presidency of the City Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The attacks on his report sent Moynihan into the deepest depression of his life, which he rode out at Wesleyan before taking up a professorship at Harvard. It also left him in a curious position: a liberal despised by his own kind. With increasing vehemence, he returned the sentiment. A similar response to James Coleman's 1966 study of equal opportunity in education, which showed that parental income had more effect on educational outcomes than any other factor, ratified Moynihan's breach with the left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with his friends clustered around a new magazine called The Public Interest - Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell, James Q. Wilson - Moynihan was reacting to evidence that the programs of the New Frontier and Great Society were failing to achieve their goals. @km- Wing the responses of this circle, Moynihan's was the most political. He didn't give up on social policy as an instrument of change - at least at first. He gave up instead on the supporters of social policy the people who had maligned and abused him. Moynihan concluded that what we would today call political correctness was undermining the ability of government to do anything for the disadvantaged. \"The liberal left can be as rigid and destructive Continued on Page 68 as any force in American life,\" he wrote in Commentary in 1967.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senior Statesman Moynihan walking the halls of Congress with Senator Patrick Leahy last year. After 24 years in the Senate, Moynihan did not seek reelection to a fifth term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Vilification also initiated what might be described as a career-long quest for exoneration. To be sure, Moynihan remained politically ambitious. But more than professional success, he demanded his due, to be acknowledged as a seer, not just about the black family, but about every topic he touched upon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AFTER ROBERT Kennedy's assassination in June 1968, Moynihan was left without significant ties within the Democratic Party. By the end of that year's presidential campaign, he was writing obsequious notes to Richard Nixon. Nixon, who had admired Moynihan's articles in Commentary, approached him after the election with an offer to become his chief domestic policy adviser. Having two Harvardpedigree professors, Moynihan and Henry Kissinger, helped assuage Nixon's own insecurities. Moynihan knew just how to flatter Nixon, telling him that he was a 20th-century Disraeli. In Nixon, he also found the ideal audience for his eviscerations of upper-class liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's role in a Republican White House was at once that of policy maker and ideological warrior. He argued for maintaining Great Society programs he had earlier criticized, not because he had decided they could be made to work, but rather because doing otherwise would play into the hands of liberals. The same justification underpinned the welfare reform scheme he got Nixon to support, the so-called Family Assistance Plan, which was based on the idea of a guaranteed income to every poor famfly. The FAP, Moynihan's most audacious attempt at social policy, was based on an idea contained in his report on the black family: that welfare contained an incentive to family breakup, since only single mothers qualified.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem with his plan was that it was at odds with everything else he had learned, both about the destructive effects of welfare and about the potential for social engineering to produce massive unintended consequences. And indeed, subsequent experiments showed that a guaranteed income increased rather than reduced rates of marital breakup - presumably because it freed men from the need to support their families. That Moynihan didn't anticipate this result can only be explained by politics: he thought the FAP would destroy the left by pre-empting its demands. After the Family Assistance Plan died in Congress, Moynihan wrote \"The Politics of a Guaranteed Income,\" his longest and most serious book, lay.ing. the blame on liberals who opposed the plan because benefit levels weren't set high enough. To create a noble failure seemed almost the point.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Moynihan was in Washington fighting fire with FAP, student radicals were threatening to burn down his house in Cambridge, forcing his wife and children to evacuate. In this context, in January 1970, he wrote Nixon another of his acerbic memos. He argued that blacks were making steady progress but that black-on-black violence, radicalism and reverse racism against whites were undermining it. Moynihan thought that the most useful thing the administration could do would be to damp down rhetoric and create more jobs for unemployed black men. \"The time may have come,\" he noted, \"when the issue of race could benefit from a period of `benign neglect.\"' After Nixon distributed the memo to his cabinet, a copy leaked to The New York Times, and the phrase, taken out of context, was used to bolster the accusation that he was a racist. To Moynihan, the reaction underscored the lesson he had drawn from the Moynihan Report: that liberals would never treat him fairly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, in fact, edging toward the view that critics accused him of holding: that racial and social problems were hopeless - at least so long as the left blocked sensible discussion and action. When Nixon offered to send him to New Delhi as the American ambassador, Moynihan leapt at the opportunety. India was a good place to sit out Watergate and what remained of the Nixon administration. It also got Moynihan thinking about why America was so hated in the third world. In 1975, he distilled his views into an article for Commentary, \"The United States in Opposition.\" The essay, which set out to explain why the United States was so often in the minority in the United Nations, dissected the lock step anti-Americanism of the so-called nonaligned nations. On the basis of the article, Kissinger recommended that Gerald Ford make Moynihan the United States ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the United Nations, Moynihan proceeded to do what he recommended. Unwilling to accept the State Department's preference for diplomatic inoffensiveness, he denounced, in the loudest possible terms, the hypocrisies of third world dictatorships. After Idi Amin addressed the General Assembly, Moynihan attacked him as a \"racist murderer.\" This was too much for the bureaucracy at State, which distanced itself from Moynihan's remarks, and even for Kissinger, who drove him out after only eight months in the job. But in New York, Moynihan became a hero for his powerful denunciations of the resolution equating Zionism with racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan deserves great credit for his work at the United Nations, even if his accomplishment was mainly a rhetorical one. What he did there was to forcefully articulate a consistent liberal internationalism, based on democracy and respect for human rights, at a time when noninterventionism and skepticism about America's role in the world were becoming dominant strains in the Democratic Party. Indeed, looking back at the 1970's as a whole, Moynihan appears as a liberal loyalist even though he spent half the decade serving Republican presidents. Unlike many of his fellow neoconservatives, Moynihan never entirely abandoned either Democrats or the idea of an activist government, at home or abroad. He simply argued that liberals needed to be smarter, more selfcritical and empirically driven. Ending his seven-year Republican exile, he announced his Senate candidacy as a Democrat in 1976. With the help of a divided left and an endorsement from The New York Times, he won a narrow victory. EARLY ON, HE EStablished what kind of senator he would be. Moynihan would not dominate a single field, as Russell Long did with defense, or build a record of legislative accomplishment on social issues, as Ted Kennedy has done. After Moynihan's four terms, the sole major bill to, his credit is the 1991 transportation bill known as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or Istea, a grab bag that has done little even to advance his own goal of supporting public transportation. Nor would Moynihan excel at pork barrel like Robert Byrd or constituent service like Al D'Amato.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where Moynihan would prove superior was in bringing his understanding to bear on debates that otherwise might have taken place in a kind of historical and intellectual vacuum. His metier was performance in the Finance Committee and on the Senate floor, which he would hold with sardonic, digressive lectures. These speeches were most trenchant during the early Reagan years, when Moynihan found his voice in opposition. To the chagrin of his allies in the neoconservative movement, he opposed the invasion of Grenada and denounced the C.LA.'s covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. A more consistent Wilsonian than Reagan, Moynihan argued that both actions violated international law. As a crude measure of his evolving views, his rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action soared from 47 percent in 1979 to 95 percent in 1982.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the introduction to his 1988 collection of speeches, lectures and articles, \"Came the Revolution,\" Moynihan paints his shifting stance as a bit of mystery even to himself. He records that \"something in the new administration had sent me into opposition in a way I had not ever been before, not felt before.\" In retrospect, he points to two other factors. One was the refusal of conservatives to recognize that the Soviet Union was on its last legs. The other was his analysis of the Reagan budget deficits. Moynihan believed that they were an intentional effort to make it impossible for liberals to expand the federal government. David Stockman, the intellectual behind the budgetary disaster of the 1980's, had worked as a baby sitter for the Moynihans in Cambridge in the late 1960's. At the Gridiron Club dinner of 1981, the senator lampooned his protege's evolving enthusiasms. \"I have never known a man capable of such sustained self-hypnotic ideological fervor,\" Moynihan said. \"One day he arrives at Harvard preaching the infallibility of Ho Chi Minh. Next thing you know, he turns up in Washington proclaiming the immutability of the Laffer Curve.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As fine a period as the early 1980's was for him, he failed to emerge either as a leader of the anti-Reagan opposition in Congress or as a savior of the Democrats. In truth he lacked the discipline, focus and organization to lead. Where other senators cultivated a loyal, long-serving staff, the irascible Moynihan produced a distinguished alumni association. His current chief of staff, Tony Bullock, is his 17th in 24 years - and the record holder at four years on the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Somehow, whenever Moynihan turned from analysis to action, he always seemed to lose himself in the old thickets of revenge, pride and Pyrrhic victory. This was certainly true of the 1988 Family Support Act. The bill, which was the only major welfare reform passed into law until Clinton signed the Republican-sponsored Personal Responsibility Act in 1996, was in principle an attempt to condition welfare on work. But Moynihan resisted the Reagan administration's push for something resembling workfare on the grounds that liberals wouldn't support it. Thanks to abundant loopholes in the bill, only a tiny fraction of recipients ended up working. In the years following the bill's passage, welfare rolls continued to rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's inspired idea of a Social Security tax break, which he proposed in 1991, is another case in point. Having served on the commission that created the Social Security Trust Fund to provide for the retirement of the baby boom generation, Moynihan became incensed that Social Security surpluses were being used to mask the depth of the Reagan deficits. He said that if George Bush, who was then president, wouldn't address the problem, Social Security taxes should be reduced and the system returned to a pay-asyou-go basis. What was brilliant about his idea was that it used the Republican device of a big tax cut to call the bluff of fiscally irresponsible conservatives. The idea had legs. Newt Gingrich and the Heritage Foundation quickly got on board, scaring the wits out of Bush administration officials. But Moynihan left his proposal to dangle and die. After announcing it, he departed on a three-week tour of Africa and the Middle East. In the final analysis, he didn't want a Social Security tax cut. He wanted to make a point.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why wasn't Moynihan more effective? The familiar explanation, no longer spoken in whispers, was his fondness for drink. Hodgson, whose standards are English, says his friend the senator drinks merely a proper amount. He notes that Moynihan these days imbibes nothing stronger than Tio Pepe sherry, which his aides jokingly refer to as \"the Mexican ambassador\" (as in, \"don't bother him he's with the Mexican ambassador\").</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the drinking, however, there is the more significant matter of Moynihan's temperament. Like Nixon, he lacked the largeness of spirit necessary to transcend his animosities. When the opportunity to address social policy questions arose again after Clinton was elected, Moynihan remained too obsessed with the past to engage in another reform effort. He thought of the Clintonites as arrogant liberals of the type who had demonized him in the 1960's and 70's. Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala's connections to the Children's Defense Fund, which had opposed his 1988 welfare bill, especially set him off. For him, the political had become entirely personal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This temperament ultimately made Moynihan a better critic of politics than practitioner, a man with a greater aptitude for analysis than for accomplishment. Thinking and writing are activities that come naturally to him. Getting things done has always been a challenge. This was something that Moynihan recognized about himself early on. There's a striking comment in a letter written to a friend in his graduate school days that Douglas Schoen quotes in his 1979 biography of Moynihan, \"Pat.\" Moynihan described himself as having \"almost first-class critical intelligence\" but \"secondclass abilities.\" This inversion of Justice Holmes's famous assessment of ED.R. was all too acute. Moynihan's awareness of the odds against successful government action, and the perpetual tendency among his fellow politicians to ignore those odds, has made him a brilliant critic of politics. But it also prevented him from becoming a top-level political practitioner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Henry James somewhere describes a mind too fine to be violated by an idea,\" says Moynihan's old friend Irving Kristol. \"Pat really was too much of a thinker to be violated by politics.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AS HE APPROACHES REtirement, Moynihan seems to have been devoting most of his time to writing and arguing that he was right. And to be sure, he was ahead of others on many issues. Moynihan was a lonely worrier about automobile safety in the late 1950's, before Ralph Nader happened upon the scene. He has never quite proved that the Reagan deficits were an intentional conspiracy to undermine domestic government, but he was certainly correct that they would have that effect. And in his most famous analysis, Moynihan was on the mark in arguing that the increasing rate of family breakup in the black community was a catastrophe in the making.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many other cherished prophecies, which he touts to the point of obnoxiousness in his 1996 book, \"Miles to Go,\" fall apart on closer examination. Moynihan asserts, for instance, that he alone foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union, in a 1979 article in Newsweek. His writings from the 70's yield statements that can be taken as predictions of just the opposite. But even if Moynihan gets credit for forecasting that the Soviet Union would fall, he was mostly wrong about the reasons. Moynihan focused on the problem of ethnicity; he thought Uzbeks and Tajiks would throw off the chains of their colonial oppressors. Something like that happened in Yugoslavia, but ethnic conflict was a relatively minor factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union. And Moynihan drew the wrong implication from his prediction as well. He used it as an argument against the Reagan military buildup. But that buildup hastened the Soviet collapse. We spent them into bankruptcy. (\"We spent ourselves into bankruptcy!\" Moynihan told me, in response to this line of argument.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To read Moynihan's earlier writings is to encounter an incisive intelligence and a fine, mandarin style (now sadly dissolved into a kind of self-absorbed baroque). It is also to come across a plethora of other forecasts that we would have heard a great deal about had they been borne out. Just before Richard Nixon was elected, Moynihan predicted that Democrats would continue to hold power with no real challenge from conservatives for decades to come. Around the same time, he asserted that the nation was about to suffer grievous division on the issue of public subsidies for parochial schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan does himself an injustice by encouraging us to judge his career by his predictions. In the end, it's a matter of limited interest, since no one can forecast the future with any consistency. What is more important than prophecy is analysis, and here Moynihan has few peers in politics. Since the 1950's, he has played a role unique in American politics, bringing a vast knowledge of history and social science to bear on the practical questions of what government does. Even if his conclusions have often been wrong, his insights have been genuine. For the past two and half decades, Moynihan's thinking and argument have deepened and complicated American political discourse - something that can be said for what other senator of his time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years thoughtful statesman types like Moynihan have given way to another type, furiously aggressive and ideological. Bob Dole has gone and been replaced by Trent Lott, Bill Bradley by Bob Torricelli, Harris Wofford by Rick Santorum. These transitions have left the Senate a bitter and impatient place, a glorified version of the Gingrich House which is where most of the new breed came from. Replacing Moynihan with Clinton or Lazio will complete the unfortunate process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In '94 and '96 we took the topsoil off that place with the people who left,\" says Bob Kerrey, the senator from Nebraska who, like Moynihan, did not seek re-election this year. \"But the real engine for making the Senate more like the House is Trent Lott. The reason you don't see the great debates is that Lott operates it like the House, limiting debate, and he doesn't like the messy amendment process.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan says much the same thing. \"The notion is that there is a majority, and it will vote for what the leaders of the majority think,\" he told me. \"The other side really doesn't have anything to say.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The institution has also collapsed socially. Instead of the old afterhours, across-the-aisle friendships developed over drinks, lunches and dinners, there are now ceaseless rounds of fund-raising solicitation and media appearances. To not return to your home state every weekend is to court a backlash from voters watching to see if their representative has \"lost touch.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Television has emptied the Senate floor,\" Moynihan says. \"That and money, money, money. It used to be that people would start drifting over around 5, then go out to dinner at 8. Now you go to vote and turn around and go back. On the floor is somebody with charts looking up at the TV cameras. It may be at my age that my middle years just seem more agreeable, but it was much more collegial. People talked. There was a high order of civility\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan is in no hurry to leave the job he has held for 24 years. According to a close associate, the decision to retire this year was more his wife's than his. After serious back surgery his stamina is not what it was. But in the end, Moynihan seems relieved to go because of the way the institution has deteriorated. An Oxbridge common room doesn't work if no one shows up for conversation. And these days, hardly anyone does. Moynihan's only remaining close friend, Kerrey, is leaving with him. The others are either dead, like Chafee, or retired, like Bradley, Dole and Bob Packwood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's no one left in the building he can have a glass of sherry with at the end of the day,\" says Moynihan's aide Tony Bullock. That might be taken as a depressing valedictory for a politician who has squandered a vast influence. But what a sad comment, too, about the United States Senate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jacob Weisberg is chief political correspondent for Slate.

It needs a renewed emphasis on its founding spirit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WEDNESDAY MARKS the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice, which is both auspicious and, to many Americans, possibly surprising. Central as it is to American government, this Cabinet-level agency did not exist at the founding. There was little in the way of federal law, civil or criminal, until the Civil War. In the aftermath of that conflict, however, Congress established the department. The reformist purpose was to get rid of the expensive private attorneys \u2014 often party hacks \u2014 whom the federal government had previously hired to represent it, and to replace them with full-time professionals supervised by the attorney general. Simultaneously, Congress gave the department a new responsibility: to enforce the first-ever federal statutes designed to protect the civil rights of African Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Awareness of this history only compounds our dismay at the department's course under the Trump administration and the most recent attorney general, William P. Barr. Instead of impartiality and professionalism, there have been presidential interference with policy and personnel decisions and unjustified leniency for political favorites. Instead of an aggressive civil rights posture, there have been reluctance to investigate systemic violations by police departments, backing for lawsuits against <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in college admissions and, from Mr. Barr himself, support for a police sweep of nonviolent protesters in Lafayette Square to make room for President Trump to stage a photo op.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some partisanship, real and perceived, is inevitable given that the ultimate power over federal law enforcement resides with politicians in Congress and the White House. In that sense, creating the department in 1870 was, at best, a partial fix for a dilemma inherent to the Constitution. From the beginning, and increasingly since the mushrooming of federal law enforcement authority in the 20th century, critics have accused the Justice Department of undermining the rule of law rather than upholding it, as anyone familiar with the careers of A. Mitchell Palmer or John N. Mitchell \u2014 or even Robert F. Kennedy \u2014 knows. The troubling covert surveillance warrants against Trump supporter Carter Page belong on that list, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One way to reduce the risk of politicized or otherwise abusive federal law enforcement may be to reduce the sheer scope of federal criminal law, which has become overgrown and duplicative. As part of criminal justice reform, Congress should trim the excess, consistent both with the Constitution's assignment of primary responsibility for crime control to the states, and with the efficiency-promoting aims of the department's founders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, though, a large role for the Justice Department must remain \u2014 the legitimacy of which will depend on the ethos of its leaders, up to and including the president. Despite its imperfections, this is an indispensable institution; its career staff represents a vital national repository of public-spirited talent. These officials embody the legacy of reform and heightened independence in the post-Watergate years \u2014 a period that provides a hopeful precedent for today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than new policies or procedures, the Justice Department needs rededication to its founding spirit \u2014 professionalism and impartiality \u2014 and renewed emphasis on its oldest mission: civil rights. The Trump administration has shown itself incapable of that rededication. The next president and attorney general will have to do the job, urgently.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}

Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.
