He will have to become a Democrat.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">In his doomed but endlessly inventive effort to grovel his way back to political favor by taking positions way to the left of his own party, the senator came out for ''across the board'' affirmative action and pledged to proclaim the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation some kind of quasi-Kwanzaa holiday. If the Lott panderthon had lasted into the weekend, he might yet have endorsed Al Sharpton's theory of the Tawana Brawley case or popped up on Comedy Central to host a holiday festival of ''Sanford and Son'' reruns. Tom Wolfe couldn't make this stuff up.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">But of course he already did. The hypocrisy and cynicism we saw in the Lott affair from nearly all parties -- political and otherwise -- was ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' all over again. The supposed cause of our new racial uproar, the senator's remarks at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party, rapidly became irrelevant to the big picture (as did the clueless majority leader himself). Is Mr. Lott a racist? According to Jim Jeffords, former Senator Paul Simon and nearly everyone else who knows him, he's not. But after awhile that no longer mattered. Mr. Lott had become, in the words of a widely quoted (but unidentified) White House hand, a ''walking pinata.'' And a most convenient one. Republicans, Democrats and the press alike could all prove our moral superiority, cost-free, by stringing up a certifiable fool.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">But we shouldn't congratulate ourselves quite so fast. The Lott story didn't break this month -- it broke four years ago. Where was the press then? Where were the Democrats? From December 1998 until the following spring, a black columnist at New York's Daily News, the politically nonpartisan Stanley Crouch, repeatedly laid out goods on Mr. Lott more damaging than the senator's latest transgression: his long and intimate association with the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens, an organization whose initials are not a phonic echo of K.K.K. for nothing. A few newspaper reporters and columnists recounted the same history, but Mr. Crouch, instead of winning a Pulitzer, was largely ignored by big guns in the media as well as by political leaders of both parties.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Lott's new offense almost fell through the journalistic cracks as well. Though his embrace of Mr. Thurmond's past took place in a room full of Washington reporters and politicos and was broadcast on C-Span, it was not at first reported in any paper (or on any evening TV news broadcast), even those that did cover the Thurmond party. Why? It may be because the spectacle of a leading Republican backslapping with unreconstructed Dixiecrats did not initially strike anyone as big news.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">When Jeb Bush succinctly condemned Mr. Lott for the crime of being ''damaging to the Republican Party'' -- as opposed to, say, being damaging to black people -- he was telling the truth. Mr. Lott would not have hurt his party were he an anomaly within it. What made him toxic to the Republican fraternity was his careless revelation of its darkest predilections.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">Among the Lott transgressions that resurfaced during his trial-by-media was an occasion in the 1990's, cited by Robert George in The New York Post, when he summoned black staffers abruptly into his personal office ''to provide 'color' for photos in a media profile.'' Such a media strategy is no different from that of the 2000 Republican convention, where the party filled the stage with a ''Soul Train'' jamboree of break dancers and gospel singers to provide ''color'' for its own image. The goal of that minstrel show -- as well as of the strategic planting of black faces in likely TV shots on the floor -- was to belie the fact that black delegates at that convention made up 4 percent, a historic low for the party (even lower than at the Pat Buchanan-Pat Robertson convention in Houston in 1996).</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Lott's public display of nostalgia for the South's racist past is hardly unique either. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, gave an interview to a neo-Confederate magazine, Southern Partisan, in 1999 in which he vowed ''to do more'' to defend the legacy of Jefferson Davis, a Lott hero as well, from anyone who would smear him for having ''some perverted agenda.'' (Slavery, perhaps?) Some of Mr. Ashcroft's actions in public life have matched his words. When he was Missouri attorney general in the 1980's, a federal judge threatened to hold him and his state in contempt for their ''continual delay and failure to comply'' with a landmark voluntary desegregation plan in St. Louis, according to a Washington Post report in January 2001. When running for governor, Mr. Ashcroft even boasted of having done ''everything in my power legally'' to fight that plan. This was 35 years after Mr. Thurmond's Dixiecrat candidacy.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">In its effort to portray Mr. Lott as a one-of-a-kind bad apple, The Wall Street Journal's editorial page said on Thursday: ''Republicans may once have used race to polarize the electorate, especially in the South. But that strategy long ago stopped being useful.'' Tell that to George W. Bush, who beat John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary after what Newsweek called ''a smear campaign'' of leaflets, e-mails and telephone calls calling attention to the McCains' ''black child'' (an adopted daughter from Bangladesh). Or to Sonny Perdue, the new Republican governor of Georgia, elected in part by demagoguing the sanctity of the Confederate flag.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">Long ago stopped being useful? Tell that to Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Bush, who appeared at Bob Jones University in 1999 and 2000. ''Of all universities in America,'' asked the commentator Fareed Zakaria on ABC last weekend, ''why is it that Republicans have felt the need to make a pilgrimage to the one university that bans interracial dating?'' Now that Mr. Lott is no longer the issue, will any of the conservatives who called for his decapitation answer that question?</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">The point here is not that these Republican leaders are racists, or that all (or most) Republicans are racist, or that all racists are Republicans. ''These are not normal Republican ideas,'' wrote the conservative author David Brooks, in a characteristically thoughtful piece about Mr. Lott in this week's Newsweek. And he's right. But there are still too many Republican politicians who believe they can pander to whatever racist voters are out there without being called on it. When they are, they cringe -- not so much because they care about losing their few black votes but because they care about losing soccer moms who are offended by race-baiting. ''Elections are settled in the suburbs nowadays, 43 percent of the vote,'' said George Will in condemning Mr. Lott. It's that political reality, not any moral imperative, that mandated the majority leader's death sentence.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">President Bush is no bigot, and as he likes to remind us, some of his best employees are Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. He is in favor of something called ''affirmative access'' -- which has led to a grand total of zero black Republican Congressmen in the next Congress. ''Compassionate conservatism'' seems less a program than a p.r. strategy to provide cover for the likes of a Lott or an Ashcroft.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">Asked this week what the administration has done for black Americans, Ari Fleischer used the kind of examples we heard from Mr. Lott. He said that ''the president looks forward to going to Africa'' (how patronizing can you be?) and wants ''to double funding for historically black colleges and universities'' (weren't the Republicans for color-blind policies rather than a politically correct form of de facto segregation?). Mr. Fleischer also said that the president sees education as ''the next civil rights movement.'' If so, Mr. Bush is not that movement's courageous leader; in his education bill, he dumped the tiny school voucher provision that Republican polls say many black families want.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">Black voters are not fooled by such empty theatrics. For all the ''diversity'' at his convention and his rhetorical ''compassion,'' Mr. Bush drew a third less of the black vote than his father and Bob Dole did. The White House's main concern now is that white voters be fooled. So Republicans are trying to create a moral equivalence between Democratic racial lapses and their own, hoping that Robert Byrd's long-renounced K.K.K. past and use of the word ''nigger'' will somehow blur their own recent record. Bill Frist is the ideal new Senate majority leader, because his own genuinely good works in Africa and ''compassionate conservative'' geniality will camouflage a voting pattern that, on any issue touching black Americans, is virtually the same as Mr. Lott's.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">I almost feel sorry for Trent Lott. Despite all the hyperbole that preceded his demise, he is no Bull Connor or David Duke or even Jesse Helms. He's just the guy who had to die before anyone looked too closely at other, even more powerful politicians' sins.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400;\">Drawing</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"The essay only briefly mentions affirmative action.": "3"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 18s "}}
